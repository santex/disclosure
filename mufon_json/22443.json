I thought it was just a street light on the horizon, but as i came up over the hill i saw the light was high in the sky. As soon as i got a good glimpse of it, the light dissapeared. Then a few seconds later about 5 or 6 more lights appeared forming a widening half circle until they dissapeared as well. My brother said it was c130 flares, but i looked on youtube to see what those looked like, and the lights i saw were MUCH MUCH MUCH bigger and the direction in which the lights i saw resemble nothing of the c130 flare videos i saw."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/22/2010 04:56 UTC"}
