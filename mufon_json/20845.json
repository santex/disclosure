{"divs":["sighting detailsi was in the area of town known as eastside, i was walking to the store sometime between 8:15 and 8:30pm. when i walk at night i like to look at the stares, naming constellations and thinking maybe i'll get lucky and see a ufo. i remember looking to the north\\north east and saw what i initially thought was a plane. we have an aiport and i see planes coming and going all the time, for about maybe 20 seconds or so i didn't think much of it but a few things about it didn't seem quite right. most lights i see on planes have a distinctive pattern of arrangement, the way they blink and such. but this was just one blinking red light, it must have been pretty far away, because i couldn't tell if it was a strobing light or a light that just blinked off and on. at this point i still thought it could be a plane or a helicopter(we also have a coast guard airport). the light was not stationary, it was moving west from what i could tell, and very slowly. slower than a plane and i believe slower than a helicopter would be moving. i must have watched it for about 5 minutes maybe, and from what i could tell it must have been moving rather slowly for an aircraft. if i had a ruler at arm length it would have covered a distance of more than a foot, maybe a foot and a half. as far as i could tell it didn't make any sound, but that could have been due to the distance. at about halfway through the sighting a plane i see coming and going all the time flew through my field of vision, it was closer to me than the light was so i could hear the plane. i recognized its lights pattern and the sound of its engines, so i had a reference to what a plane would look like at that moment in view while watching the other light, and there was a definite difference. the plane flew into my field of view and disappeared in under a minute, meanwhile this light is still moving at a rather slow speed. some people might say it was a flare, this was not a flare. flares don't move horizontally like this, they float down to the ground and their light flickers, they dont have a consistant blinking light. i was in a hurry so i started walking again, i couldn't have walked more than 10 feet before i truned back to look at it again and it was gone. no zoom off into the distance, just gone. it was a clear night so it couldn't have just disappeared behind some clouds, the only clouds were way off into the distance, hugging the horizon. that was the last i saw of it sadly."],"Log Number":"US-12032009-0002","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/03/2009 01:57 UTC","Summary":"Blinking red light in the sky","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"12/01/2009 08:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.372761,+-124.21617(20845)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20845) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Coos Bay","There were no other sightings in Coos Bay on or around December 1st 2009"],"Longitude":"-124.21617","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20845.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20845.html"],"City":"Coos Bay","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oregon","Case Number":"20845","Latitude":"43.372761","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
