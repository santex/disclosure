I noticed it because it was very bright. At first I thought it might've been a shooting star, but then I noticed it was too big to be one and it was flying toward my home. It flew at a slower but steady pace over my house and continued to fly NW. I tried to focus on it, but it was so bright that even with squinting my eyes I still couldn't focus on it. I was scared of it. I didn't want to move, I actually wanted to hide so that it wouldn't \"see\" me. I lost sight of it when it flew farther away."],"Date of the Event":"05/18/2013 11:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47503.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47503.html"],"Longitude":"-84.116251"}
