Shortly after dark on the 21st of Oct. 2010 I was going to close my gate when I saw 2 bright orange lights in the low western sky. I'm 69 years old and have NEVER seen anything like this. They appeared to be over Fern Ridge lake west of Eugene, Oregon, about a mile from my position. They were stationery and after a few seconds were joined by a third light between the two. All three in a straight line horizontal to the ground. A few more seconds passed and all three slowly disappeared as if they were on a rheostat. As I continued to watch for a few more seconds they all three appeared again at a lower altitude and a little further southwest and closer together. I would guess they were no more than a few hundred feet in altitude. After a few more seconds they disappeared slowly and never re-appeared.When visible they were motionless. This was all in a matter of a minute or so. It was a clear night, stars visible, and a nearly full moon. There was no sound, and the lights appeared to be about 25% the size of the full moon."],"trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Eugene","There was one other sighting in Eugene on or around October 21st 2010"],"Case Number":"26270","Latitude":"44.055069","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None"}
