The windows were all open because it was 30+ degrees today. I was resting on the sofa half asleep. Suddenly he jumped out of his chair and said: Look! what is that? What is it? From the large screen window, we saw a glowing orange sphere (basketball size) fly slowly across Lake in a straight line close enough to us, then it went faster further away from us and up to the sky about a mile away. There's another houseboat on the other side of the lake (from the side where the light originated) maybe they saw it too? We didn't hear any sounds. We had an excellent view on open waters. We've been houseboating for many years and never seen anything like this."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","trends":["There has been one other sighting in French River","There were no other sightings in French River on or around July 14th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.151668,+-80.387644(40809)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40809) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/14/2012 11:48 UTC","Case Number":"40809","Latitude":"46.151668","Region":"Ontario","Log Number":"CA-07142012-0030","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40809.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40809.html"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/14/2012 10:01 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
