After I saw this I new it could not have been a airplain and still dont know what to think about what I saw it hade me looking up at the sky the rest of the day."],"Latitude":"41.615915","Region":"Illinois","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/10/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/10/2008 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Plainfield","Summary":"cigar or cylynder stationary at high alttitude zoomed out of atmosphere","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"11124","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06102008-0014","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Plainfield","There were no other sightings in Plainfield on or around June 10th 2008"],"Longitude":"-88.204069","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11124.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11124.html"]}
