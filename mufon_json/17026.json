There were 3 portholes on each end of it (one on each end and one at the front point). This was moving extremely slowly and not making a sound. As soon as it was directly above the deck it made a sharp left turn (my right) and continued moving just as slow only now there was a deep, low pitched, quiet hum that would not have been audible from inside of my house. After it turned it continued until I couldn't see it due to trees blocking my view."],"Longitude":"-75.383121","Summary":"Extremely slow, low and noiseless until it turned then there was a low, deep hum.","Date Submitted":"05/18/2009 09:00 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.286318,+-75.383121(17026)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17026) map </A>","Object Features":"Window(s)","Latitude":"40.286318","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/18/2009 09:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
