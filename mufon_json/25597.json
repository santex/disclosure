[first name removed\\cms\\dr] says he thinks the one the night before was actually brighter than venus but just didn't have the star things poking out like venus does - it was just a glob of light like this one was too. well, we're watching this thing approach, fly right over us and we turned around to follow it's path. as it got closer to the east, it suddenly went up! and completely faded off in a second. we both saw a couple small, faint flashes but not plane light flashes as it changed from the level flight path to the straight up one. we could not believe it! we even burst out laughing like you do when something is so strange and so completely unlikely to happen to you. we were in a state of shock, not knowing quite what to think. so about 1\\2 hour later, we went out again, and this time, there were planes in the sky which we could easily see their white, red and green lights blinking even the one that was probably about 15k feet or better so the two things we have seen were not planes plus there was no comparison on size - the planes were like 100th the size as the light blobs. the second one also made no a sound. now we did see what was probably a regular satillite and they are much, much smaller and much higher. either way, we are shocked. we have noticed both sightings were when there were no planes in the sky at all. either time. we are on a flight path from points north - portland, seattle south to la or the bay area - and they usually follow the mountain ranges or i-5 with the flights on pretty much hourly schedules. very interesting that this second one was coming from west to east at sort of a southerly heading cuz there are no flights coming from that way ever. there is nothing in that direction but the pacific ocean. my husband estimated the first light at about 10k feet and the second one at maybe 15k feet. we live in a small town without interference from city lights so our view of the night sky is good."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25597.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25597.html"]}
