My sister glanced out the window and saw something in the sky. She ran out the door telling us to come out. We went out onto the back patio and saw this glowing orange orb coming from the east pretty quickly. We thought maybe it was a New Years balloon, but it was moving too quickly. I ran back into the house and grabbed my camcorder, but by the time I got back out it had moved even further north. I still tried to film and zoom in. In the video, the light to the lower right is a cell phone tower. I tried to film the object as best as I could. It was such a brillant orange color! We watched til it faded from our view to the north."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Corunna","There were no other sightings in Corunna on or around January 1st 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"41.436052","Date Submitted":"01/01/2012 03:56 UTC","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
