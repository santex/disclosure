I decided to take my aunt and her husband to do a cross country on the Cherokee archer II, from Oakland County International Airport, MI to Huron County Memorial Airport, also in Michigan. The duration of flight is around of 2 hours. My aunt on the back shot a picture during run-up and says: \"I think I just shot a picture of an UFO\" her husband and I look to each other and I said I would look it the camera later at home because I was paying attention in doing the run-up and fly the plane. during the whole flight she took pictures, and when I got home I went to look at the pictures. We end up with 3 pictures of the object, as soon I saw it, I said to myself is an UFO, it's cylinder in shape and followed us trough the whole flight."],"City":"Waterford Township"}
