(the orange light on the bottom of the craft would get bright for 2 seconds and dim. this would repeat every 2 seconds.) i saw that it was passing to my left about 200 feet away just above the tree lines over the alvin golf country club. there was a break in the tree-line and i actually slowed and finally stopped the car when i saw clearly a black triangle shape passing by slowly. it was silently and steadily moving about 15-20mph heading north-east. i had my driver-side window down and watched as it flew past me and my car. i immediately grabbed my camera and made a u-turn to follow it and attempt to snap some photographs. i hurriedly and excitedly snapped 4 photographs before it disappeared into the distance on its north-east path around 1:30am. i was doing this while driving so the photographs have motion blur. i have attached two of the photographs of the object where it can be seen as well as a rough-sketch from my perspective in the car. some interesting observations: -the craft was black- although the sky was dark, i could easily see a dark triangular shape against the dark sky. -the craft was also relatively thick. i would say that it was about 15 feet tall at most and about as big as a large car. by my estimation, it would fit perfectly on a two-car driveway that many homes have. -the edges were not sharp but rounded. -i was shocked at how silent it was when it passed. -the pulsing light gave me the impression that it was a kind of signal to let other flying planes or helicopters see that it was there to prevent a crash."],"Longitude":"-95.275069","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.442491,+-95.275069(38316)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38316) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38316.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/38316_submitter_file1__IMG1077.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/38316_submitter_file2__IMG1078.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/38316_submitter_file3__IMG2012052000135.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38316.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-05212012-0001","Case Number":"38316","Summary":"Black Triangle Craft heading North East","Date of the Event":"05/20/2012 01:25 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/21/2012 12:11 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Alvin","Latitude":"29.442491","Object Features":"None"}
