As it approached,and began to pass behind me,I struck my cigarrette lighter on high and held it up in the air.The craft began to pan around me at my left side until it was directly in front of me.It was twenty feet off of the ground and thirty feet forward of me.It was silent and there was no rotor wash,which a helicopter would give off.It was archaic looking,discoidal in shape,had a cupola on top,a beacon on the bottom,which it had instantaneosly turned off when I had lit my lighter.The sky was completely clear.All aircraft flying towards Iraq were above twenty thousand feet and were observing light discipline.The discoidal craft had leading edges that were flattened out and scored.The craft gave off a field of palpable energy.I had with me a loaded M-16,a set of night-vision goggles,a PR-77 radio telephone to communicate with the Command Post,and an unloaded M-60 strapped to my back.I felt no fear,indeed the opposite was true.All I could do was outstretch my arm strenously.I felt as if I were hypnotized.The craft began to oscillate faster and faster like a gyroscope until it came to rest, showing it s underside.A pattern of lights emerged.First was three pinpoints in the shape of a triangle.Then four pinpoints in the shape of a rectangle.Then one point of light that out- stretched itself into a long line of light.All I can remember next is the craft moving north and finding myself walking towards our GP Large(tent).My guard duty was supposed to have ended at 12 midnight,but my watch showed it to be 1:30.I had lost time.I entered the tent and woke up the next guard who was impossible to awake.I had to drag him outside,and set him on a picnic table.I re-entered the tent and laid down on my cot and got into my sleeping bag since the desert nights are cold.Maybe one minute later the entire tent erupted into chaos.Private First Class **** ********* was being choked in his sleep by Specialist ***** ******.The rest of the personnel were waving M-16 s around and flashlights were playing on the walls of the tent.Personnel were screaming.It was as if everyone had been suddenly released from suspended hypnotism or something.Weird.I don t know if that craft was an Air Force or Navy aerial platform or not,but whatever it was it was awesome.
