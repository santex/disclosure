I was at the top of Beaver street on the left hand side of the street walking down the Hill. I look up into the sky towards the south and I saw a luminous bright white sphere about three times as large as Jupiter and much brighter than Jupiter move accross the sky. I saw it at about a sixty degree angle about the horizon. In four seconds it moved accoss the sky and disappeared behind the fog. It was in a clear part of the night sky. The gibous moon was easily visable. The object was too fast and bright to be a sattelite and a plane at that altitude. I believe it was a U.F.O. I have seen several objects like this before but never reported them to MUFON because I did not know this organization existed. I have also have had three encounters of the first kind which I will be reporting to you in your \"Best Evidence contest.\""],"Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Windy, Fog","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3602.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3602.html"],"Latitude":"36.787661"}
