{"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Long, pulsating lights, moving extremely fast","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were outside looking at the thunderstorm over the Denver Metropolitan area, looking west and north west and I saw a long shaped object with exremely fast flashing lights. At first I thought perhaps it was a plane, but immediately realized that it was moving incredibly fast and the lights were fluttering or flashing at a extreme rate. As I looked up about the treeline, the object moved west northwest I would say 100x faster than an airplane, which caught my attention so I told my partner to look very quickly, she saw it as well and I lost sight of it, and she continued to see it as it immediately and sharply turned due west. I then caught it again in my sight as it again turned sharply and immediately southwest. My partner stated she saw an airplane below the UFO traveling at a much slower rate at in the sky just below the object."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Date Submitted":"06/07/2012 03:46 UTC","City":"Westminster","Latitude":"39.881219","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.881219,+-105.026045(38938)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38938) map </A>","Longitude":"-105.026045","Tags":"City","Region":"Colorado","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Westminster","There were no other sightings in Westminster on or around June 7th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-06072012-0009","Country":"United States","Case Number":"38938","Object Shape":"Cigar","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38938.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38938.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/07/2012 01:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
