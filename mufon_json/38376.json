{"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Rochester","There were 2 other sightings in Rochester on or around May 21st 2012"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy girlfriend and I were on our deck last night looking at stars etc and all of a sudden we saw objects many miles away that were triangle shaped (3 lights) red, green, & white on each corner. 2 of them were moving fast together and stopping on a dime sort of in unison. They must of been further away (east of Rochester MN). 1 that seemed somewhat closer to us (North) stayed still. All 3 had the same lights and triangle shape. There were a lot of stars out last night but these stood out. It could not of been a star, comet, or plane. We do have the Rochester airport near by and we did see some planes too, but the planes looked like planes. We have never seen a plane go up and down and zig zag and completely stop and go again like this. After about 15 minutes of watching and following them ,they just zipped off and were gone. My girlfriend stood and watched this with her eyes. I tried using my camera but could not pick it up, too far away. We both saw this visually at times and it was easier for me to see in my binoculars. They were many miles away for sure. I am 43 & she is 36, we live in a average neighborhood etc and have never seen anything like it in our lifetime. It felt eerie - Scott & Michelle."],"Case Number":"38376","Latitude":"44.038058","Log Number":"US-05222012-0016","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Triangle shaped objects with 3 lights, red, green, and white.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Rochester","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38376.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/21/2012 10:45 UTC","Region":"Minnesota","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.038058,+-92.536992(38376)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38376) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/22/2012 12:57 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-92.536992"}
