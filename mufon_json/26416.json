{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was infront of my house downtoun salida co. It was a clear sunny day and I was talking with my neighbor out on the sidewalk. Thats when i looked up and saw what I thought was a milar high alt. wether ballon witch I have never seen before. So I grabed my camera a sony cyber-shot 7.62mega pixels with 3x optical zoom. zoomed in all the way and took four shots of the object. On that day the wind was at an averge 20-30mph from west to east. So I thought it strange the object went from directley overhead to due north out of sight in under 120 seconds.The forth shot shows my roof for contrast and depth.In the first three shots the top of photo is east in the forth shot east is to the right side of photo. Later upon review I found other u.f.o.s not visibul to the naked eye during the sighting."],"Date of the Event":"06/07/2008 09:41 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"(sg) I thought i was looking at a high alt. wether ballon till i viewed photos, and found it was the shape of a piramid with a light on bottom.","Case Number":"26416","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Region":"Colorado","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"11/07/2010 08:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11072010-0011","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26416.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26416_submitter_file1__shot1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26416_submitter_file2__shot3.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26416_submitter_file3__shot4.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26416.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.542749,+-105.997842(26416)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26416) map </A>","Latitude":"38.542749","Longitude":"-105.997842","Tags":"City","City":"Salida","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Salida","There were no other sightings in Salida on or around June 7th 2008","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
