{"divs":["Sighting Detailson october 5, 2003, i was sitting in my wheelchair in my living room by thefront door of my home. i noticed lights moving in the west of my position in anabnormal manner in the distance i got my sony digital camera with the 10X zoom, pointed it in the direction of the lights and began shooting. Since then,thelights have been out there every night the bugs bite so bad that i could onlyget outside on two of those nights, but i took about four hundred pictures. unfortunately, i shoot many of them through the screen.did not matter much, only the closest images were greatly effected. the smallerimages, presumably further away provide the best detail.there seems to be 3 or 4 classes of vehicles. a large dark craft in the fardistance - resembles back view of traditional V craft, and two similar butdistinctly seprate multi-decked sphere shape craft.i do not know what the glowing disk are but they are always seen together withthe other three three craft.i will be out there tonight with my camera."],"Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/10/2003 10:00 UTC","Case Number":"2599","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2599.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2599.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/10/2003 10:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.565804,+-81.948283(2599)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2599) map </A>","Summary":"moving lights on horizon are structured craft 3 o","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Cape Coral","There were no other sightings in Cape Coral on or around October 10th 2003"],"Sighting Duration":"01:59:00","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","City":"Cape Coral","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Latitude":"26.565804","Log Number":"","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-81.948283"}
