{"Date of the Event":"01/10/2008 07:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsJust after sunset, while in my backyard, I saw a fast moving object that changed colors ( bright red to blue to green) as well as direction very rapidly. It seemed to come out of nowhere, close to the ground (2000 - 3000 feet?). As it got closer it seemed to slow down a little and then change directions suddenly and then disappear . Army helicopters from Ft. Hood were in the area at the time. This object did not appear to be anything like an aircraft or meteor or any other standard object that I have seen before. I heard no noise (other than the helicopters)."],"City":"Belton","Date Submitted":"01/10/2008 07:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8877.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8877.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Belton","There were no other sightings in Belton on or around January 10th 2008"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.464453","Case Number":"8877","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"31.056013","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Summary":"Just after sunset while in my backyard I saw a a fast moving object that changed colors as well as directions rapidly.","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01152008-0022","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.056013,+-97.464453(8877)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8877) map </A>"}
