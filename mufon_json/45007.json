I first the saw object as a crescent moon in the NNW sky. It got my attention because the moon is never there. The object then descended at a 45 degree angle and changed from a dull silver crescent to a long, bright neon cigar. It remained stationary for several seconds then began to yaw back and forth. It finally darted off rapidly at a 45 degree angle to the NE, changing shape and color and blinking as it did so. Incidentally, the old Livingston, NJ Nike missile site would have been directly below where this object was, approximately 5 miles from my home, where I observed it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.727771,+-74.28518(45007)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45007) map </A>","Summary":"Crescent shaped dull silver object changed into neon white cigar then flashing multicolored UFO","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
