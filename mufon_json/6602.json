I was in my kitchen but had not turned on any lights yet. I was looking out the window and admiring a dark but clear morning with many stars and Jupiter plainly visible. My view was of the southern sky over San Francisco and the penninsula. I noticed a couple of jet airlines passing overhead and heard them faintly. Still looking I noticed five or six smaller lights moving quickly from east to west in the same area of sky. They moved in somewhat of a formation, that is they all seemed to be moving at the same speed but some of them changed position as they went and at such a speed that it almost looked like \"dancing lights\". I know of no aircraft that could so easily change position at such a high rate of speed. I heard no noise from them and after they passed my positon I ran to the front of my house to see if I could continue to watch them but the bright street lights blotted out anything I might have been able to see. The whole episode took approx 10 seconds."],"Date of the Event":"03/22/2007 05:30 UTC"}
