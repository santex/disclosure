So, me and some friends looked up again tonight & it was there again! Triangle shop, hovering & then moving in fast random motions & slowed motions. Seems to have \"headlight\" at the top of triangle, at one point glowed orange & \"shot out\" beams of red. I started watching it at around 10 something, it is now 1:20am & i can still see the object but, it has \"calmed\" going much slower, no fast movements & seems to be getting farther away."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41150.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41150.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41150.html"],"Tags":"City"}
