The light coming from it had a brownish hue and was at least 20 times brighter than any plane light in the sky. The light was constant and there were no flashing lights coming from it, as is required after dark. The UFO hovered north, before slowly stopping, then heading the opposite way, keeping a precisely consistent altitude and distance from my location. I am not aware of any man made machinery that is capable of such a maneuver. The object slipped back into the tree-line, and since we were in a car, I tried to drive and get a better view. About 20 seconds later, when I had a clear view of the horizon, it was nowhere to be seen."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34687.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34687.html"],"Log Number":"US-01072012-0006","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-96.72682","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Intensely bright hovering object","City":"Richardson","Latitude":"32.954389","Case Number":"34687","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Richardson","There were no other sightings in Richardson on or around January 4th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Disc","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/07/2012 06:44 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/04/2012 06:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
