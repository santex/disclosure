{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailswhile at my computer in the office i was listening to the police scanner. someone had reported a hovering shiny disc\\orb which was large here in rio rancho. i went out in the back yard to see if i could see anything. immediately i saw in the north sky what appeared to be a huge illuminated cloud. it was massive and beautiful, highly detailed like ice crystals. whatever was shining on it exposed the material in detail. then immediately this huge shadow ascended slowly swallowing the light.... and then there was nothing. this was late at night around 10:00 to 10:45 as the news was still on tv. i couldn't not make out the shape or size of the object ascending, but it was massive and from my viewpoint, not far from me in the neighborhood. perhaps two to four streets north of me. i heard nothing more on the police scanner and nothing was reported on the news. the only other witness that i know of was the person who reported it to the rio rancho police department. thank you."],"Case Number":"37717","Log Number":"US-04242012-0015","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37717.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37717.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Hovering shiny orb reported on police scanner, so I went outside to look.","City":"Rio Rancho","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/24/2012 07:31 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-106.728518","Date of the Event":"04/23/2012 10:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.224229,+-106.728518(37717)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37717) map </A>","Region":"New Mexico","Latitude":"35.224229","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Rio Rancho","There were no other sightings in Rio Rancho on or around April 23rd 2012"]}
