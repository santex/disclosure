{"Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI'm near the CA-OR border, and was at the Yreka Walmart at about 6:45pm(still daylight), when I noticed a silvery flash about a 500 yards away, and about 500 ft high.. At first glance I thought it was a large rectangular piece offoil catching the light.. It stayed in one place for about 3 minutes, then it moved up, down, sideways, at about which time my Daughter(22), and Mother(82) approached the car.. I quickly said,\" Look at that!\" They watched with me and speculated it must be aluminum foil, but the object moved south to the hills and as it moved up and down it looked like something performing a search pattern.. They were still sceptical as we watched the object drop into a shaded draw.. Then things got very interesting because even though everything around it was shaded, this object was still shiny and reflective like sun on polished chrome.. Eventually it moved in back of the low-lying hills, and was gone.. Wish I had a cam-corder.."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.739319,+-122.626901(19126)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19126) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19126.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19126.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Yreka","Date of the Event":"06/18/2009 07:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Yreka","There were no other sightings in Yreka on or around June 18th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/07/2009 10:23 UTC","Longitude":"-122.626901","Object Shape":"Flash, Square, Rectagular, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"Just south of Yreka Walmart, watched silvery, flashy object for 15 min.","Region":"California","Case Number":"19126","Log Number":"US-09072009-0017","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"41.739319","Country":"United States"}
