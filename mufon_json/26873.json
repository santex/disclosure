{"Latitude":"58.307534","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a dark, cold night in Alaska.I had just trapped my last otter for dinner. I was outside roasting it when a large egg-cigar shaped object came low to the surface, I thought it was a Phoenix.My small chihuahua, Beast, barked wildly as it came towards us. I grabbed my Otter and walked slowly toward the object. As I got closer a bright light shown upon me and next thing I know I am inside it. These beautiful purple women with long sparkly antenni touched my stomach. Then an owl flew above the women and stared deep into my soul. This owl reminded me of the one i had as a pet when I attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I tried to cast a spell on the woman but they used a counter spell and it rebounded. Then I realized wait.. I cant do spells.. Harry Potter is not real. The women decided to impregnate me. They did it using Invetro Fertilization. Then I died. I woke up in a field in Kentucky in 1941. They took my Otter."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=58.307534,+-134.414622(26873)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26873) map </A>","Summary":"They took me with them and dropped me in a cornfield in Kentucky.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","Date Submitted":"12/06/2010 02:11 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Juneau","Object Shape":"Cigar, Egg","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26873.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Juneau","There were no other sightings in Juneau on or around December 1st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-134.414622","Date of the Event":"12/01/2010 07:33 UTC","Case Number":"26873","Log Number":"US-12062010-0005","Region":"Alaska","Sighting Duration":"12:57:06"}
