With other dogs in the house I cannot leave her home alone until the stitches come out. In-between 1995-1996 while living 13 miles from Stephenville down 281 (which has Selden on the way), I witnessed something similar to the latest reports. I worked nights back then but due to being sore decided I would call in sick. About 10:30 pm while I had my outside dogs food soaking they started barking like something was around (coyotes, snake) so I went outside to see what was up. They were at the end of a fence line so I went to it and looked and didn't see anything they could be barking at near the ground, but I did notice a very bright light flying low to the ground way off in the distance. I thought then maybe a helicopter with a search light and if it came closer I might hear it or a plane that was flying way too low that would need to be monitored. As I recall the moon was not out thus I thought maybe that made the light seem bigger and brighter than I though even a plane would have. I quieted the dogs down and went back in to get their food. When I went back out they were back to barking at the end of the fence so I made them come get their food. I walked to the fence line again and this bright light was a lot closer to the point I should have been hearing an engine or something. I could tell it was flying low under radar since a Russian plane in Germany did the same thing over our Army Base. Not hearing any sound I decided to wait and find out what could be flying that low without hearing an engine. When it came closer I could hear a humming sound (only sound it made). It passed directly overhead blocking out all the stars above and was only about 180-240 ft above the ground (mobile home 60' wide used to estimate this). It was round with some lights on a bottom that looked metallic and I estimate that it was 3-4 acre's round (size of my place now). Needless to say I was amazed and scared at the same time. I ran in and got my gun and 35mm camera and notice the TV had no interference on it while the Tonight show was on. When I got back outside I realized how stupid it was to get my gun since I wouldn't shoot at it. The camera was at the end of the roll so I don't think I got a picture of it (some film I still haven't ever developed). The thing was headed in a direction that would take it directly over Hwy 281 and it was moving really slow, probably about 10 mph. I went back inside and wrote down all I could think about it and then called in sick to work. I considered calling the Air Force, but decided against it since if no harm came to me I didn't want any harm to come to it. I doubt there is any way in this world we or any earthling could have a ship that big that they could hide much less only make a humming noise to power it. I had heard a few years earlier that people in the North had seen something the size of football fields that the government said was objects flying in formation. This was low enough to see the huge bottom was solid and it blocked out all the stars above so it wasn't several objects flying in formation. Since that time I have moved back to my place which is 3 miles out of Stephenville and during that move all my belongings where outside during a 6\" rain. I have never come across the information and sketch I made that night, though I haven't looked for it either. Being this close to town I just considered it a once in a lifetime event that confirmed what my mother and father told me about seeing in the 50's was a lot more believable. My father was in the Army 21 years and worked in radar. He told me that while firing missiles at White Sands and around El Paso they often tracked UFO's that sometimes had planes sent up to check it out but they never heard anything back from it. What they saw was a cigar shaped ship that was doing things none of our air craft at the time could do (he loved planes and stayed up on them). Being this close to town I did not think anything like this would venture this close but last Tuesday I did hear some jets fly over twice which is not a common practice for this area. Since 911 I maybe only have heard them a couple of times before. Also one night quite a while back I thought I heard that humming sound again, but I didn't go outside to check it out since I thought there was no way they would come this close to town. Now I know different. I did not see what was recently seen, but Selden is only about a 6 minute drive from the location of what I saw years ago. The very bright light and only making a humming sound with being big is similar enough to spark my interest. After getting on the internet and finding your site I did search some to see if any reports where made similar to what I saw. I don't think I ever filed a report with you though due to it being so long ago and I have never found the information I wrote that night. Some papers where so soaked they did get thrown away, but I have never gone through everything yet. I am glad you are coming down to investigate their story and wish I could be there to talk to you too and hear what goes on. I don't care if the world believes, but I will eat your hat if you can prove what I saw was man made :), since I am 100% sure I wouldn't be eating your hat. As for abductions I still have doubts, but wouldn't put it past any civilization to do experiments on lower life forms just as we do. Probably why I got my gun during the experience, to protect my animals if need be. Another strange event happened at that location another time a few years before that may have been an encounters presence but I didn't move to find out. Again it was a night when I didn't go into work, but this time I was sleeping. My Yorkies where barking and growling like someone was in the room near the door to which my back was facing from a small bed in my den. Then they came over and jumped up on the bed and barked and growled at something close by. I had the feeling that someone was in the mobile home and standing right next to the bed so I kept my eyes closed and didn't move. When I had the feeling they had moved away I did try to move a little and I couldn't. When the dogs ran back to the door I opened my eyes and it looked like daylight outside the window. I closed my eyes again and played like I was rolling over when I heard the dogs jumping on the door and when I opened them again I realized it was pitch dark. The kitchen was right behind me so I went there first for a knife, turned a light on and then went to a bedroom for a gun. I looked out the bay windows which faced the road and didn't see any lights or hear any cars. I went outside and waited about 10 minutes and never heard a car. That time my outside dogs had not been barking. I never heard the door open and close in that time either and it was always kept locked. My Yorkies had barked at the door before, but never like that or growling while barking nor did they ever do it again. It wasn't until years later that I ever thought the 2 events there might have been connected somehow. All windows and doors in the house where locked, and when I went outside my outside dogs where there to meet me. Since they didn't bark I doubt the event pertained to humans. I haven't read a lot about encounters, but from what I have heard they had not happened with animals around thus I never thought of it that way until later. I can write that off maybe as a dream waking to the dogs barking and growling at the door, but I did wake up and go outside and check all the windows the next day. The ship I saw a few years later was after I had been sleeping all day and gotten up at my normal time to feed the animals before going to work. I don't talk a lot about these events, because if I heard them from someone else they would raise doubts with me even if they came from a trusted source. I mean I loved my mother and father and trusted them to all ends, but still it wasn't until I saw something that I could really believe what they saw may have been real. Unlike their event though mime was up a lot closer than what they saw since it went directly overhead. People always want proof, but even if I had it I wouldn't give it to them now. Still I'm glad to know that others have maybe seen what I saw and get a laugh how the government tries to explain it all away. I remember seeing an asteroid driving home one early morning that you could still see after daylight until it really got bright. I watched the news to see if others had seen it for days. Finally after 2 weeks I did hear a report that there was a near earth miss from an asteroid, but the danger was gone. So what ever the government knows they will never reveal it because they don���t want us to panic. I seriously doubt they have made contact and with as destructive as we are I think we are only being monitored to make sure we don���t pull a stunt that may upset the universe. With America���s new strike before struck motto I just hope no one gets stupid enough to try to strike them for proof. We have fought foes mightier than us before and won, but never someone so far advanced above us. I hope people will enjoy their experiences if they are lucky enough to have them, picture and report about them to this type of location, but never shoot at them or report them to someone who might."],"Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.230226,+-98.192933(8839)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8839) map </A>","Tags":"City","City":"Stephenville","Case Number":"8839","Date of the Event":"01/08/2008 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
