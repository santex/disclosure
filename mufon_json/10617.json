As I was killing time watching some older kids riding their bikes, a bright golden light appeared to the east over some mountains, in the direct line that I was already looking. Difficult to say with any certainty, but it was probably about 4-5 miles away. It was extremely bright. It did not look like a reflection at all, but was definitely more of an intense light source. It was brighter than any aircraft-based light that I have ever seen or heard of. It did not appear to be moving at all. I kept my eye on it and reached for my cellphone camera. As the camera was booting up (seemed to take forever), the object simply disappeared. Immediately after the sighting, I text messaged my wife and told her I had just seen a UFO. It was a very strange experience."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.084996,+-115.151136(10617)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10617) map </A>","Latitude":"36.084996","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
