It appeared to zig zag back and forth, then disappear in one spot, and then reappear in a different spot. About 5 minutes into this event, the object reappeared just above the treeline, this time instead of being a yellow-white color, it was red, it had no blinking lights at all, and since it was pretty far away, I couldn't hear any sound (except the sound of cars since we live next to highway 41), then it started to slowly descend, then I lost it behind the trees. I went inside to grab the camera, my cell phone, and our telescope, but I waited for probably an hour, and it never reappeared."],"Log Number":"US-11112010-0006"}
