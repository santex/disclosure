{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in the army signal corps radar school at Fort Monmouth from January until July of 1952. Some of the advanced students had progressed to the point where they were operating the radar units. They reported tracking an object moving at a high rate of speed and making a right angle turn that no airplane could have made.A short time later,all radar students were taken into a large empty building and told that had seen nothing,heard nothing,and knew nothing about the matter.That was an order.I was not one of the advanced students.I only tell you this now in case it ties in with other data from that era."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"object detected on radar at ft. monmouth army base","Date Submitted":"05/31/1952 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.306018","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Long Branch","There were no other sightings in Long Branch on or around May 31st 1952"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"New Jersey","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.306018,+-73.98565(10621)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10621) map </A>","Case Number":"10621","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.98565","Log Number":"US-04302008-0009","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/31/1952 12:00 UTC","City":"Long Branch","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10621.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10621.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10621.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
