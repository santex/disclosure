I ran down my drive way away from the light to get a better view of it but the object was one. I then waited for about 10 minutes to see if I could see the object again when my girlfriend came home. I told her what I just saw and we were looking into the night sky when all of a sudden a very bright light appeared just over the tree tops approximately a half mile away from our location. The object appeared to be stationed but had slight back and forth, up and down movement. It was also giving off indescribably light source from underneath the object. The object then disappeared, then re-appeared and took off. Loosing sight of the object about 2 minutes after we saw it. I noticed an increased number of planes after my first sighting and after the second sighting. The planes where moving much faster then passenger planes do. When my girlfriend and I saw the object we did not know what to think."]}
