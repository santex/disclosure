Looked up and saw large, large yellowish, white orb of light just sitting there. Looked to be half the size of full moon. Watched for a few seconds and it blinked off. In about 3 or 4 seconds it blinked on again. It kept doing this for around a minute.All of a sudden, it shot straight up in the sky and headed toward Columbia at a very high speed and was out of sight in what seemed like a second or two. I am a retired police officer and am still a Constable in Adair County, and I have no idea what this thing was."],"Summary":"large, bright orb,blinked on and off","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-85.30136","Date of the Event":"09/03/2011 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-09082011-0025","Latitude":"37.111061","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31658.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31658.html"],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Columbia","There were no other sightings in Columbia on or around September 3rd 2011"],"Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Columbia","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
