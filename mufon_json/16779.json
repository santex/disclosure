(*note - the first time i saw it before it \"fell\" it was sitting in one place for about 30 minutes) the last two times we saw it, the object initially appeared as just the dull red color. it behaved the same as before except that it appeared to be moving up in the sky. when we saw the object we didn't know what it was but figured (or at least hoped) it had a us military origin. at the beach there is a lot of air traffic in general and we are very close to pensacola naval air station also, hours earlier on the 27th we saw a number of military aircraft flying over towards pensacola nas. even so, what we saw is certainly not something either of us had ever seen before and we both spend a lot of time in orange beach. the video is very, very shaky because it is hand held and super zoomed in. the object is only moving slightly west to east or stationary...not jerking all over the place. you can see the object \"blink out\" two or three separate times. the last one is the easiest to see. the video is in two parts that were recorded about ten minutes apart. other than trimming out parts, nothing has been done to alter the video. it has sound, but only of us talking, so i took that out. i was able to capture the object only three times as i was new to the camera and i was having trouble getting it to focus on the object because it was so far away. i was unable to record the last sightings because the red was too dull for the camera to pick up\\focus on. the camera used to capture the video is a sony handycam dcr-sx40 with a 60x optical zoom. all of the video is zoomed in all the way. all of the settings are factory...i assume. so to recap, it first appeared to be in the sky beyond bayou saint john in the general direction of arnica bay \\ josephine, al. it stayed in approximately the same 1\\8 of the sky, but appeared\\reappeared seemingly at random in all different parts of that 1\\8th. it stayed in a range of approx. 60 to 20 degrees. the ufo hung around in one general area for about 30 minutes, then fell rapidly for some distance, then just randomly disappeared and reappeared in different parts of the sky for about 30 minutes until finally reappearing as just a red dull color and moving slowly from n to ne for about 10 minutes until blinking out for good."],"Log Number":"US-05032009-0007","Latitude":"30.294368","Region":"Alabama","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Orange Beach","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","City":"Orange Beach","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.294368,+-87.573594(16779)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16779) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like, Unknown","Tags":"City"}
