High in the sky, too high for an airplane, but too stationary for a helicoptor, I spotted a large reflective object. It was shaped like an old telephone receiver. Like 2 circles connected by a straight center. It was refelcting the sunset so it looked like it was glowing orange on the belly of it. To amke sure it was not a plane, I pulled over so I could watch its movement. It stayed stable in the sky. Did not leave the spot it was in. This was too high for a blimp or hot air balloon. It was not moving or putting out a contrail, so it was not an airplane. The thing is, lately at sunset I have been seeing jets criss-crossing eachother and making huge X signals in the skies over Nashville at sunset with their exhaust, anyone can go outside and see them. This object was hovering around those X marks."],"Latitude":"36.17407","Longitude":"-86.781193","trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There were no other sightings in Nashville on or around September 20th 2007"],"Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Tennessee"}
