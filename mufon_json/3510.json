I first noticed the object because of the lights, but i thought it was just a reflection. Then I got closer and i realized it was an UFO. I thought it was a kite at first, because it was moving as if it were tied to something. It had a choreographed movement. It would spin, dart for left to right, do a barrell roll, dive then come back up to where it started and begin again. During the sighting, i felt happy and curious, but I was trimbeling a bit. After the sighting,I was very scared and shakey, i was worried about my safety. I lost sight of the object, because i drove closer then I looked away and i never saw it again after that."],"Region":"Colorado","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-06272005-0007","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3510.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/3510_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3510.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/25/2005 10:30 UTC","Latitude":"39.52712","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Wings","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.52712,+-104.758883(3510)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3510) map </A>","Summary":"Triangle, about the size of a car, red and blue lights","City":"Parker","Weather Factors":"Windy, Lightning, Rain, Light"}
