I returned home from a Christmas party with friends around 10:00Pm and was doing some work on my computer. I hadn't been drinking. My living room window is directly behind me facing due east. Around 1:30 AM I started to shutdown to go to bed when I glanced out the window and noticed a flickering light in the sky (same as I've reported in the last several days with the exception of blue lights). It seems to be hovering above the Ham Lake-Andover, MN area. It seems to be lower tonight than on previous nights. There are light wispy clouds in the background of the object. So I'm assuming this one isn't in orbit as I supposed the others were. I have been watching it now since 1:37 Am and it is now 2:11 AM. It has given no indication of moving from its position. I wish it would come closer so that I could get a good clear picture of it. I should report that two days ago I did observe the same star like object in orbit, but there were two of the one preceding Orion and one following Orion in orbit."],"Summary":"Larger than Star sized, Flashing lights of Red, Green, Yellow, white in the middle.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.188087,+-93.384301(34311)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34311) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
