Object was moving too slow to be a plane or helicopter like 10-20mph it seemed like heading in the SE direction towards the Atlantic Ocean. Two things that seemed irregular, speed of object and the lights. Object slowly flew away out of sight to the horizon."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.409741,+-71.374617(44333)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44333) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44333.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44333.html"],"trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Summary":"saw it flying over house looked like a plane but was going too slow","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12052012-0009","Region":"Massachusetts"}
