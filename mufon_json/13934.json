{"Object Shape":"Fireball","divs":["Sighting DetailsHeading south on Bakerview road aprox 5:30 PM saw a flash with a long tail moving across most of sky in 3-4 seconds. Very clear evening, not a plane or like any shooting star I have seen, much brighter and lower than a satellite. The duration and speed of movement caught my eye and made me really hold my breath, it was unlike anything ive ever seen and moved east to west as I drove south."],"Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"11/13/2008 05:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"13934","Longitude":"-122.486435","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Streak accross 2/3 rds of sky very fast, covering a great distance in 3-4 seconds.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.769083,+-122.486435(13934)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13934) map </A>","City":"Bellingham","Log Number":"US-11242008-0014","Latitude":"48.769083","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Washington","Date Submitted":"11/13/2008 05:30 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Bellingham","There were no other sightings in Bellingham on or around November 13th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13934.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13934.html"]}
