I noticed an object in the sky, but thought it was an airplane or helicopter. I looked in the same direction a few seconds later and noticed it was in the same spot. I kept looking at it as it hovered and reflected light, so I ran in my house to get my camera,(but forgot my glasses which I need for seeing objects upclose, thats why in the video I am going in and out of focus). I filmed it for about one minute, if you freeze frame certain parts you can see it. My feelings during all this was that of excitement."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"35357"}
