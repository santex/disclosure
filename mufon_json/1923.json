It looked like a comet with a hugeumbrella tail that looked like a jelly fish, luminous etc. It made no sound butslowly traced through the sky for about 20 seconds. Right when I started torealize what a beautiful and amazing sight it was, the ball disappeared in puffof smoke and trail slowly dissipated with some whisps floating over my house ahundred feet or so up. It was the prettiest thing Ive ever seen.
