I held my breath, not frightened, but rather totally amazed, as it floated, unhurriedly towards a small stand of landscaped Dogwood type of trees, float behind one and disappear. I thought, \"I just saw an orb.\" I looked up more information on orbs when I got home, but have never been quite satisfied with information I found, because this was not an etheric looking ball, but physically solid looking.I know this is not an extremely dramatic sighting of something out of the ordinary, except to me, but I was watching a UFO story on Discovery last night (in Fayettville,NC)and I immediately took notice of the drawings of the huge, orange spheres that were shown and realized that was the same color orange and looked like what I saw, only much, much smaller. I will always believe this orb was aware that I was there watching it and maybe even wanted me to see it."],"City":"Greensboro","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Greensboro","There were no other sightings in Greensboro on or around April 30th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"North Carolina","Date Submitted":"04/30/2008 03:00 UTC","Longitude":"-79.790365","Log Number":"US-10282008-0025","Latitude":"36.079505","Summary":"Orange child size ball floated by window and disappeared","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.079505,+-79.790365(13309)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13309) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13309.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13309.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
