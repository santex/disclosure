{"divs":["sighting detailsin response to another case reported from neenah\\winnebago area-case# 33373- ufo's were visible from ripon wisconsin as well. also appeared to be in the western direction and not too far in the distance. i've been starbathing for about 6 years now with much video proof of many activities in my area, as well as objects on the ground, and in my tree-60 feet off front porch which i may send that video for you too, another time. these particular objects i have gotten on video basically doing the same thing in 2009-for 3 days, with our lovely military doing there best to chase them with 7 or 8 fighter jets. this time no jets, but the scenario is the same-lights open up in the sky, craft comes out, and lights fade out. the last time i caught it on video it was lighter and you can make out shiny spheres in the video that would light up a little bit when they accelerated or changed direction abruptly. too dark to make that out this time but what came out definetly strobed kind of like a plane but different kind of light. i missed four of them for sure when i turned and ran to get the camera, possibly more when i was out of sight, but for sure the first four i saw i didnt get, but could still see blinkys when i got back. 1.where was i? at home 2.how did i notice? giant lights in the sky-kinda hard to miss 3.what did i think? uhhh-cameras thatta way----> 4.description? some kind of transportation 5.my feelings? i see so much that i dont get emotional 6.how lose sight? bright holes went away and blinkys scattered i rendered this video as mpg but original is high definition"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33375.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33375.html"],"Latitude":"43.793298","City":"Ripon","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-88.865627","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Ripon","There was one other sighting in Ripon on or around November 15th 2011","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.793298,+-88.865627(33375)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33375) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11162011-0003","Date of the Event":"11/15/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Other","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/16/2011 03:22 UTC","Case Number":"33375","Summary":"Response to case# 33373 Video for you"}
