We had a brief interlude from clouds. It had just become visable (on the rise). The moon was to my left. I looked at what I thought was Venus or Jupiter (in front of me, looking over my house) and was commenting on how freakishly bright it was and then it just dropped. I was freaking out! It stopped then shot southwest then zig zagged to a western flight path and was gone."],"Date of the Event":"04/04/2012 07:58 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Blountville","There were no other sightings in Blountville on or around April 4th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"04/10/2012 07:52 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.540959,+-82.322646(37342)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37342) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-04102012-0006","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Tennessee","Longitude":"-82.322646","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
