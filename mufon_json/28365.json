These arent the first sightings I have had of the object(s). I have just decided to start speaking about it so maybe someone will tell what they are or at least come forward as a witness also.. About last nights sighting, instead of the object being behind my left shoulder as my prior sighting the night before, this one was in front of me in the NW sky and it wasnt as close as the sighting before. I didnt state how far away I thought the object was in last reported sighting but I will estimate it was up to one mile away, maybe closer but up to one mile. In the sighting I will say it was three times that far. The objects are sometimes muliple in the sky, at different locations, just hovering, with multicolored lights that seem to go around the perimiter. I thought maybe its something that monitors the gas wells in the area, but dont know. I am scared to take a picture but if I get the nerve I will post one or send to mufon to view."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"28365","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/22/2011 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-97.31854","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28365.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28365.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"another report to go with yesterdays","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were 4 other sightings in Fort Worth on or around March 22nd 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Fort Worth","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.730309,+-97.31854(28365)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28365) map </A>","Latitude":"32.730309"}
