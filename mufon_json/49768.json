As I was driving they would be hidden behind trees but then come into view again. I then noticed at least three cars pulled to the side of the road in various locations but close proximity, all of the occupants were also looking up in they sky. I stopped and asked one of the occupants if they saw the lights, he commented yes I saw them as I was coming south on Highway 280 and followed them to here. He also stated they were bright orange, without my prompting him. Then the lights were gone. I told my brother about the sighting and he said they sounded like Phoenix Lights. I then Googled Phoenix LIghts and the shape and color looked exactly like what I saw. The difference was I saw more of them and they were hovering in a shape I did not see on the internet."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49768.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49768.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"49768","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-119.409902"}
