It started around 9-9:30pm PST when my fianc��� and I went outside to our backyard to let our two dogs out. Let me preface this: I've recently gotten into amateur astronomy, and just bought my first telescope a mere 2 weeks ago following the purchase of a pair of astronomy goggles that just blew me away a few weeks before that. With my new hobby, I've found myself looking up at the night more than I ever have before. Jupiter has been amazingly bright and clear lately and it was because of this reason that I took my astronomy goggles out back with me. My fianc��� and I both commented on how abnormally clear and sharp the night sky was, almost as if someone had turned the focus knobs on the night sky and got rid of the typical atmospheric distortion we're used to seeing over Las Vegas. There was no moon in the sky (at least from our vantage point), so the sky was deep and dark and it really made the stars and planets appear sharper and brighter than usual. In fact, it was the first time I could clearly see the Orion Nebula with just my binoculars. As we stood in our backyard, with my binoculars in hand, we were looking to the northeast towards the direction of Jupiter when I noticed what I assumed to be a satellite, or maybe even the International Space Station, scooting quickly from north to east approximately 65-70 degrees above the horizon. I followed it with my astronomy goggles and got a nice crisp view of it, however, it looked just like a bright star. No sound, no contrail, nothing, and I could tell this object was very very high up. There was no shape to it, just a bright pin point of light traveling across the sky. While odd, the object didn't make any right turns or shoot laser beams out it's belly so we didn't get too excited over it, however this was just the start of the evening. The object eventually moved out of site as the back-side of our house blocked our view of the object traveling farther east-southeast. It was no more than a minute after the object left our field of sight when we both saw what had to have been the biggest shooting star we've ever seen. It traveled in almost the exact same path as the object we first saw, except in the exact opposite direction (East to North). Unlike a typical shooting star that shows up as a little streak of light that lasts only a second or two (if you're lucky), this one had to have lasted a solid 9 or 10 seconds (count it out... that's a LONG time for something to streak across the sky!). It looked far more like the Shuttle re-entry than it did a typical shooting star with a flaming tail spanning easily 35-45 degrees over the sky. My fianc��� and I both watched it until it seemed to explode into a few pieces over the northern horizon. The whole thing looked eerily similar to the Space Shuttle Columbia as it re-entered and tragically blew apart. Needless to say, this was bar none, the biggest \"shooting star\" we've ever seen. Again, this doesn't necessarily scream of E.T. yet, but again, this was just the beginning. As if seeing these two objects traveling in opposite directions along the same trajectory and time wasn't weird enough, it couldn't have been more than 30 seconds after the first shooting star exploded that another shooting star shot across the sky! This one wasn't as big as the first (and it didn't explode), but I noticed it because it came down along the exact same trajectory in the exact same part of the sky. However, the strangest part was that it traveled along the same path, NOT of the first shooting star, but in the opposite direction along with the original object I saw. I'm no expert, but common sense tells me if a shooting star follows 30 seconds behind a bigger shooting star it should be coming down in approximately the same direction, not the exact opposite direction, as one would assume the two are part of the same celestial object (or at least one of his friends or neighbors). We stayed outside for another 5 minutes or so before we had to get back inside because we had ordered a pizza. We were so excited we saw what we thought to be a once in a life time shooting star, however I was still stuck on what the first object was and why in the world a shooting star would cross in a perpendicular path to another shooting star, and on top of that, why all 3 objects would appear along the same line in the sky all within a few minutes of each other. This was all truly weird, but we had pizza to eat. Fast forward to 4:45am PST and it's time to let the pups out in the backyard again. (We work from home, so we often turn nocturnal and wind up staying up all night.) At this pre-dawn time, the night sky seemed even more impressive than it had in the evening prior. It was crystal clear out and now Jupiter was just about straight overhead, so I decided to go inside and grab my new 8\" telescope to get some great views of Jupiter (of which we did). I brought my binoculars out with me so I could view the sky while my fianc��� took command of the telescope pointing straight up towards Jupiter. I was looking in approximately the same area when I noticed another fast-moving point of light, like a star flying across the sky. It was just like the first object I had seen last night, yet this time it was directly overhead traveling from the northwest to the southeast. I immediately grabbed the astronomical goggles and locked on to it as it flew past Jupiter. This was the turning point of the night's events. Literally. As I followed this object I noticed it start to change its trajectory towards the south. It wasn't a sharp turn, but a smooth arched curve done at high speeds. There was no visible change in the sharp point of light, no change in shape, no visible mechanical maneuver, no contrail, no nothing... just a perfectly smooth turn. It was at this point that another star came in to view of my binoculars. As the object I was focused on turned slight right it passed near this other star, and that's when things really got interesting. That star looked like every other star in the sky, but when the moving object passed close to it, the star started to move in an opposite direction towards the North!! I could not believe what I was seeing, but it seemed as if this \"star\" reacted to the object flying close by and decided to scoot along elsewhere. I immediately decided to let the first object fly out of my binocular's field of view and I followed this new object that just went from a stand-still to flying across the sky. I followed it for what couldn't have been more than a few seconds when ANOTHER \"star\" decided to pack up and move locations!! This object moved towards the west away from the second object. I felt as if I had just turned the lights on and all of the celestial bugs scattered in different directions. In fact they scattered so quickly that I lost site of the trio as I tried unsuccessfully to keep a lock on the 3rd and latest traveling star. All of this happened in the approximate vicinity of Jupiter which was almost directly over head just starting it's trip back down the sky. After loosing site of the objects I went around to the side of our house to get a view of the southern part of the sky that our house blocks from the backyard to see if I could find the first object. I quickly found it, put my binoculars back up to my eyes, and watched the object continue southward. Soon it began to dim as it traveled too far away, but it was at this point that I saw what may be the strangest thing of the night. As I was trying to steady my hands to watch the point of light fly away, there was a flash of deep orange light (almost red) that appeared in the same area of the object I was watching. It surprised me so much that I let out an audible gasp that my fiance heard - I had never seen anything like it. It almost had a flame-like appearance to it, like someone trying to light a lighter, but fails, and you only get that first flash of a flame with nothing to follow. It was that quick, in and out, and following that, I wasn't able to find any of the objects I had been following. I stayed outside with my binoculars in hand until almost 6am to see if they would come back, and decided to head back inside when the daylight really started to diffuse the stars. That was about two hours ago, and I must say that the events of last night and early this morning will go down as the strangest events I've ever seen in the sky, in space, or even in general, to date. I don't know if it was the crystal clear skies that enabled this view, but I doubt I'll ever see that much action in the skies again (although I sure hope to!). I can't say for certain what this was, and I don't know if the \"shooting stars\" had anything to do with it or whether they were just a mere coincidence (of epic proportions), but the hairs on my back and the tingle in my spine tell me I saw something very unique and very strange last night, and luckily I had my fianc��� there to back me up and let me know I wasn't imaging things. Let me just say that I'll never look at a little star in the night sky the same, because as I found out, little stars aren't always what they appear to be."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31351.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31351_submitter_file1__sighting-30-aug.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31351_submitter_file2__sighting-31-aug.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31351.html"],"Log Number":"US-08312011-0014","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/31/2011 05:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-115.283465","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Las Vegas","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"31351","Region":"Nevada"}
