But this object was flashing (this would even seem inaccurate, it was more like what a distant lighthouse would seem to do with the light dimming and gaining and then dimming again) each flash was about second apart.It appeared to moving at a South to North path at a pretty good speed and crossed Arcturus then went towards Ursa Major. As this object arrived at Alkaid, another flash appeared just below Alioth. The object then went towards this second (stationary flash) then both seemed to stop flashing and were not seen again. My wife and were both still standing there waiting for the object for 5 minutes before we realised we were getting cold and bitten by the bugs"],"Longitude":"-122.598539","Region":"British Columbia"}
