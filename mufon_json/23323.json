{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watching the all day doppler radar for channel 9, when i saw in a movement of the radar a bright ball of light flash huge it was just above the K in Apopka on the match if you can rerun it, just as a lighnting strick hit in the same exact spot at the same time a bight red streak of light came out of the ball covering 3 counties, just north to Deland. Now if that wasn't strange enough the next time the radar past the red streak had turned green at 7:13 on the time. It is now 7:14 pm and the bright round light still has the streak but its red again and the ball has a red circular edge now. Commercial.......ok its back on and they've zoomed in on radar and its gone. I'll search online now, bye"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Log Number":"US-05162010-0017","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.667867,+-81.513484(23323)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23323) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/16/2010 07:12 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-81.513484","Date Submitted":"05/16/2010 07:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"23323","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23323.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23323.html"],"Summary":"bright white light in thunder storm with red beam shooting out on doppler","trends":[],"Latitude":"27.667867"}
