{"City":"Rathdrum","Log Number":"US-10242011-0028","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was around 2:30 am., I fell asleep watching tv. A humming or whirring noise woke me up. I went out to porch, the UFO was hovering above my neighbors trailer across the street. I ran back in the house, locked the door. Aliens came and tried to get at me from outside. I called my dad to come help me and he didnt believe it was happening. I ran in the middle of my house, not knowing which direction the aliens were going to come from to get me. I tried numerous time to call 911 but my cell phone kept going off. I finally got through to 911 and the dispatcher laughed and asked me how much i had to drink that night. (i wasnt drunk,drinking or on drugs) I have pictures printed from my cell phone, its grainy but you can see the ufo. I also have the original cell phone with original photos taken."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.825293,+-116.882012(32844)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32844) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/24/2011 10:26 UTC","Object Features":"Dome","Object Shape":"Disc","Longitude":"-116.882012","Date of the Event":"09/26/2008 02:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Idaho","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Case Number":"32844","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32844.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32844.html"],"Latitude":"47.825293","Disposition":"Hoax","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Rathdrum","There were no other sightings in Rathdrum on or around September 26th 2008"],"Summary":"woke me up. called 911 for help."}
