I was driving, so I couldn't focus on the area, but when I did glance over, I witnessed on of these flashes. A total of three were seen by three people. These were very bright, circular flashes in the clouds. They were separate from one another and extremely bright. The only explanation we could think of was lightning. However, there was no impending weather in the area, no thunder, and it was below freezing out. I am aware that lightning can happen in the winter, but these flashes were perfectly round and super bright. It was surreal."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44857.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44857.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash","Region":"Colorado","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Silverthorne","There were no other sightings in Silverthorne on or around December 30th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"12/30/2012 02:00 UTC"}
