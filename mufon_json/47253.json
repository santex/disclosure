Was outside in the back yard looking up at the clear night sky talking on the phone when I saw what appeared at first to be the V-shape of Canada Geese. I waited to hear the familiar sound of their honking then noticed that the shape did not change as it would normally. As it came closer I realized that it appeared to be a triangular shaped craft with dim lighting on the leading edge (hence the appearance of geese flying in v formation). This flight path was from south to north and I didn't hear a thing as it passed overhead. The altitude was hard to judge (not knowing the actual size) but it looked to be 3-4 thousand feet up. Hard to tell, just a wild guess. Mentioned the sighting to my girlfriend, whom I was talking to, because I had not responded to her during the sighting. The triangle disappeared behind the tree in the back yard. Glad I'm not the only one that has seen the same thing. See other N. Ontario sighting."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
