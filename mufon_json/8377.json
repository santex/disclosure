There was a large light off center and smaller ones on either side. The lights were red, white and orange, and twinkled. I would guess that there was approximately 10-15 lights blinking. It looked like a group of fire engine lights, but they were about a mile up and at about a distance of 5 miles from me. The object was stationary. I watched it while at a red light and then I had to turn. I do not know how long the object was there. But it was fascinating."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"multi color lights mostly orange, red and white in a linear formation","City":"Los Angeles","Latitude":"34.253556","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8377.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8377.html"],"Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
