It was a clear nigt not a cloud insight. At the time I was with my cousin, we observed the object from a balcony. It felt like a few minutes but we lost over an hour. She refuses to date to speak of this event . I also witnessed same object=when I lived closer to the Hudson River at 159 Hawthrone Ave, Top floor Apt. 9A (? I am not sure if A or D) from the ages of 7 until we moved to MA when I was 12. I went every summer to visit my cousin's who lived on Jody Lane. What bother's me the most about the time at my cousins is the time. Lapse, what felt like a few mi utes was at least over an hour. The object was not a plane, planes do not move that fast in & then stop & hover. Also the lights spun then changed pateern I have never reported these happenings for fear of sounding crazy!"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Region":"New York","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere, Other","Date of the Event":"07/11/1983 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.720443"}
