Was sitting at light waiting when we,noticed something in the sky to our right make a sudden movement, like a sharp directional movement. There was 3 of us in our truck, it was going in front of us when all the sudden it took off faster than I've ever seen anything move. There was also a car in the lane next to us, a man & a woman, when I looked at them, (my husband who was driving & our 21 yr. old daughter, saw them looking too) they were watching it too, still sitting in the lane next to us and the light had already turned green for them!
