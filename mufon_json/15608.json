I was watching one of the chemtrails generating from an aircraft that are so prolific in our area these days when I happened to spot a very tiny white dot in an otherwise clear blue sky. My first reaction was that it was a high altitude weather balloon, but several things didn���t quite jibe with that. The location of the object seemed to be directly over Denver International Airport, but much higher than an airliner in that vicinity, and moving much too slowly for an ordinary aircraft. (It was definitely not a helicopter and this is the second time I have spotted a white morphing changing shaped white object in this vicinity over DIA). I had my variable powered binoculars with me, so I was able to get the object in view at 20 power. It was very slowly drifting north , so I increased the power setting all the way to 80 power. What I saw was quite strange. It was basically a white spherical object that seemed to be changing shape, and perhaps rotating, and continuously morphing into an oblong shape and then back into a sphere about every second or two. I watched this object for about 5 minutes and realized it was moving against the prevailing surface wind and seemed very high up. While the object was in view, I was startled by the appearance of another dark object that zipped by so fast in the field of view that I could not tell what it was. (Slim chance it was a bird, but I got the feeling that it may not have been). I also noticed a kind of glowing mist surrounding the white object, and what appeared to be a dark surface circle embedded in the middle of the white object that reminded me of a bathysphere like appearance. I am reporting this event because of the strange morphing and changing shape plus the somewhat glowing mist like appearance surrounding the object. If anyone knows what this tiny white sphere like object changing shape with a surrounding mist could be other than a high altitude weather balloon or a true UFO, please respond. I will be watching the 20 latest reported sightings for the next few days. Thank you."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Highlands Ranch","Region":"Colorado","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15608.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15608.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.552734,+-104.966286(15608)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15608) map </A>","Summary":"Small white sphere changing shape with glowing mist surrounding it.","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
