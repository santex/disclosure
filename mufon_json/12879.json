My Dad also saw it. I watch the sky all the time and have never seen anything like this. At first I thought it was an airplane since there are lots of planes that go over my house. It wasn't there Sat. the 27th, but was back the 28th and has been there every night since. It appears to wobble, to move quickly to the right and left, up and down. Sept. 29th, I was watching it and it suddenly flashed off, like someone had turned off a switch! Tonight, Oct. 1st, I went out to look (it shows up around 9:30pm every night) and there were 5 of them! The objects seems to flash white, red and green lights. I was curious about the object, not shocked because I am sure there are other beings around the planet."],"Log Number":"US-10012008-0019","Region":"Illinois"}
