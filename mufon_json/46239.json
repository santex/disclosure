I looked through my binoculars again and they noticed I was watching. As I was walking back home, the same ETs showed up as I was halfway to home. One stared me in the eyes. I held my breathe for 15 seconds. Then they \"turned to ash\" and I looked above and noticed 3 lights in triangular formation and flying away very fast."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Muskegon","There were no other sightings in Muskegon on or around September 7th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.187385,+-86.30327(46239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46239) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"09/07/2012 04:27 UTC"}
