At first it was moving back and forth from two points, i thought it looked like headlamps reflecting off cloud but there is no cloud and it was an odd path for a plane to take. I have been watching for over an hour and it has since started maving in a rough figure of eight, sometimes speeding up and it seems to move slightyl across the sky as it does this. I'm the only one here and i'm too frightened to knock on any neighbours doors as it's late."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/01/2011 10:20 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Triangle","Region":"","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"10/01/2011 06:40 UTC","Longitude":"1.101728","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Jaywick","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Jaywick","Country":"United Kingdom","Tags":"City","Log Number":"GB-10012011-0020","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.793517,+1.101728(32259)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32259) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
