They said from their point they appeared to be over Prescott Valley, where I live. Looking towards their direction from my house I could see flashes from distant lightnening, but they said that the lightening was behind them and that it wasn't flashes, but sustained globes of light that were at first appearing and disappearing, then clustering, then began to \"dance\" around. At one point they said it became a triangle, then a straight line. Eventually, they moved off in different directions. After that she said it looked like \"sparkles\" and that she saw an airplane and could tell the difference. I stayed on the phone with my daughter for about a half an hour. She was with several other people and I spoke to them, too. What each said was pretty consistant among them. My daughter said she was so freaked out that she was shaking and she sounded legitimately upset."],"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Dancing lights seen from Dewey, AZ.","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-07032009-0001","Date Submitted":"07/02/2009 09:07 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/02/2009 09:07 UTC","City":"Prescott Valley","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.535955,+-112.240254(17770)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17770) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Prescott Valley","There was one other sighting in Prescott Valley on or around July 2nd 2009"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-112.240254"}
