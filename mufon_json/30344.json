{"Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Cone","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy mom and I were driving east in the country when we saw a bright light streaking across the sky. We both exclaimed that it looked like it was angled towards the ground and would crash. We thought it might be an airplane, but it was shaped like a cone with red lights at the point in front and yellow in back. It was very fast and we watched it for less than 10 seconds. As it got closer to the ground we became alarmed that it was crashing but then it disappeared. We pulled over and got out of the jeep to see if it would reappear or to see if it crashed, but it never reappeared. We were a little creeped out at the sudden way it disappeared. It was very close to the ground, which is why we thought at first that it was an airplane landing. But there are no airports around the area and it was going way too fast. We heard no noise while in the jeep or when we got out."],"Date of the Event":"07/25/2011 09:28 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Coahoma","There were no other sightings in Coahoma on or around July 25th 2011"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-101.299733","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30344.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30344.html"],"Log Number":"US-07262011-0001","Case Number":"30344","Tags":"City","City":"Coahoma","Summary":"speeding across the sky angled downwards and then disappeared","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"32.301288","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.301288,+-101.299733(30344)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30344) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/26/2011 12:17 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10"}
