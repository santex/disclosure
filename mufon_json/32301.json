At first i thought they must have been from a plane or helicopter, but they were moving too slowly and seemed to form a perfect triangle. My friend got her phone out and started to record them. As she started recording they seemed to pulsate a few times before returning to a triangle and then to just two green lights. We watched the two lights glide over the city until we lost sight of them in the distance. I am still very confused about what we all saw, but i know for a fact that i have never seen anything like it in my life... I am submitting this footage on my friends behalf. I have also included a still image of the orbs in the triangle shape, as seen in the footage 23 seconds into the video. I should also mention that the next day, i witnessed a big black helicopter to the west, in the direction that we saw the lights. Can anyone give me some answers about what we saw?"],"Case Number":"32301","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arizona","Longitude":"-111.086971","Summary":"green orbs in triangle shape above Phoenix","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32301.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32301_submitter_file2__Screenshot2011-10-03at1.15.31AM.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32301.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.057628,+-111.086971(32301)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32301) map </A>","Latitude":"34.057628","Country":"United States","trends":[""],"Log Number":"US-10032011-0002","Object Features":"Unknown"}
