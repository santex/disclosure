(photo's only slightly enhanced on iphone 4 edit option for easier viewing) also on instagram, i looked under the #ufo & found someone else from i don't know where posted a photo of 3 lights in the sky only about half an hour after i did!"],"Case Number":"47498","Region":"Ontario","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"05/18/2013 09:45 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.927402,+-78.913545(47498)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47498) map </A>","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-78.913545","Latitude":"42.927402","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Summary":"3 small flying objects, varying in a triangle formation","Log Number":"CA-05182013-0018","Date Submitted":"05/18/2013 11:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47498.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47498.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Fort Erie","There were no other sightings in Fort Erie on or around May 18th 2013"],"Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
