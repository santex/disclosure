and i made a audible pre-cry whale. the face that the creature made still haunts me today. honesty. it���s the same face people make when they make a surprise mistake a ���eek i did something embarrassing��� facial expression. his mouth was just a slit so when he made that expression his face rippled and wrinkled like a old man. immediately whatever he was taking out of his box which was a really weird shape then but not now, it was (hexagonal with a diagonal opening and handle) put it back in got up and they marched out. again another part of this is memory that has crept me out is how they moved like the military and moved or better said marched out of my room. i was shocked and with unreal timing as i looked down the hallway when they past my parents room two more came out and filed in line which such precision and marched down the hall and all turned down the stairs out of my sight. again i must stress the timing was if they were one. needless to say i didn���t sleep the rest of the night. my younger brother was fine in the morning, and no one in my family knew anything of the nights event. i lived near a large metropolitan area at the time and our house was the only house surrounded by 260 acres of woods. i only told a handful of people since then and find it very difficult and seriously doubt many of these accounts i read of abductions myself. ironic isn���t it. they were very, very real, and i wish i dream't it but i didn���t. my impression then and my life of the events of that night is that these beings are cold and indifferent to us, basically they are not our enemies but most certainly aren���t our friends. there might be a very good reason our government has kept this secret for so long. side note: physical appearance is not as \"sinister\" as depicted. more of blue\\grey artic silver color than grey. bulbous joints with slightly distended stomachs, very similar to dwarfism. seen mouth slits move slightly along with large head movement just as like they were speaking but heard nothing."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/05/1975 12:00 UTC","City":"West Orange","Log Number":"US-11062011-0014","Latitude":"40.7876","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in West Orange","There were no other sightings in West Orange on or around November 5th 1975","This sighting has been favorited 3 times.",""],"Date Submitted":"11/06/2011 07:52 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33175.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33175_submitter_file1__grey_1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33175_submitter_file2__grey_2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33175.html"]}
