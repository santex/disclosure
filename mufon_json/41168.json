that makes no sense at all. none of these possibilities applies. size - they all appeared to be the same size. shape - round, spherical color - they all were the same color, approximately the color of a regular road flare, but slightly more pinkish. intensity - again, all of them appeared to be the same brightness. luminous enough to be seen at a fair distance, but not so bright that you couldn't look directly at them. the lights didn't blink or flash either. luminosity was constant. structure - no structure at all that i could discern. they just looked like lights(orbs). but not just a typical light, there was a different quality to them. i hate to use the word \"plasma\" to describe them, but i guess that's the most accurate description. flight characteristics - they all seemed to travel at the same speed(roughly 25 mph), and same trajectory(20 to 25 degree angle) sound - no sound at all weather conditions - clear sky, calm winds _____________________________________________ approximate distance of sightings. sighting #1 200 to 300 feet directly overhead(possibly closer than that initially, but this is roughly how high i estimate the object to have been once i pulled my car over and got out to look at it. at that point it was directly over me) sighting #2 approximately 50 yeards directly ahead of me in the road, and about 10 to 20 feet off the ground. it was extremely close. it came out either behind a house on the road i was on, or off the side street near the house, not 100% sure. if i had purchased a video camera like i told myself to do after my first sighting, i would have some fantastic footage. :( the other sightings were all at various distances ranging from 1\\8 of a mile to maybe 1\\2 of a mile. hard to estimate for certain, but judging by the size and distance of my first two sightings, i would say that the others were still relatively close. except for direction, all of these objects appeared to behave in the same way. gradually increasing in altitude at a steady speed, and at the same angle(20 to 25 degrees). the lights never dimmed, and didn't blink. this behavior remained constant until they reached a height and distance far enough that i could no longer see them. dates of sightings - november 20th, 2010 - (i reported this first sighting to mufon) a single sighting, one light january 1st, 2012 - single sighting, one light, extremely close(see description above) july 4th, 2012 - witnessed 3 objects identical to the first one i saw on 11\\20\\2010 and the second on 1\\1\\2012 july 14th, 2012, 7:38pm est - single light, again identical to the previous 5 sightings(not included in graphic)"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Michigan"}
