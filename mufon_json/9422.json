{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi had been sitting in the window smoking a ciggarette as 8 o'clock was about to roll around. and unexpectedly i started to some light above me from my window. it had shocked me so much that i stayed silent for a moment, and i said to girlfriend and my friend who had been there at the time, \"hey.. i'm pretty sure this is a ufo, come here and look at this.\" and we all started getting excited, because who'd ever expect to just see a huge triangular ufo probably each side length being a quarter mile or more. so my friend and i ran to put on our shoes and tried to get out to follow and see it for longer. but we didnt make it more than 30 yards before it had shot off to space to the size of a star and later was gone on the back it had white lights in a barred pattern as if they were side by side office windows or something but you couldnt see in them because they were just too bright, but on the bottom of the craft it was strangely arranged red and blue lights, that covered practicly the entire bottom surface, an odd pattern where there were blue lights acrossed the entire sides of the bottom surface and on the center it was all red lights and some yellow\\white. i've included a drawn picture thats as close as i can remember, which is pretty close i'd assume. i remember it well."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Washington","Date Submitted":"05/31/2007 08:03 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Log Number":"US-02032008-0004","Case Number":"9422","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9422.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9422.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Raymond","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-123.732938","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"sitting in my window smoking a ciggarette and i looked up and a ufo was coming over my house","Latitude":"46.686489","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.686489,+-123.732938(9422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9422) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/31/2007 08:03 UTC","City":"Raymond","Source":"MUFON"}
