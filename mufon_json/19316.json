Alabama","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife was sitting near our front door and noticed a bright light outside ( it was dark 17:40 hrs ). She got up and observed a dark round object with a lime green light surrounding it appearing to hover in the sky above the tree line behind a neighbors house ( very wooded ). The distance of the object was maybe less than a mile away and after 5 or 6 seconds of watching the object and bright lime green light she said part of it seem to explode and orange and red pieces began to fall to the ground with the large illuminated part also falling to the ground. No noise or crash was heard at all. The incident was reported to Blount co. sheriff's office and an officer was dispatched to patrol the area. My wife stated she does not think it was a meteor because of the way it hovered and she was sure it had a bright lime green glow to it."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.821968","Log Number":"US-09142009-0015","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19316.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19316.html"],"Region":"Alabama","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Warrior","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.821968,+-86.803499(19316)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19316) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:01:10","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-86.803499","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Warrior","There were no other sightings in Warrior on or around September 14th 2009"]}
