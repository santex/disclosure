Bright Red and Blue light burned through clouds. Creating a purple haze in sky and reflecting in all glass.","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsthe details are somewhat sketchy as it was a long time ago and of the two of us who saw it have slightly different versions of what exactly we did see. two friends and myself were going out for the evening, i do not remember where we were along, what the date was, or even what time of year it was. i think i remember it being in fall, but i am not even sure about that. in fact, i can���t even say what year it was as i tried not to think about it for a long time. i believe that it happened some time between 1995 and 1998. we were heading east on a main street that traveled through an oak forest \\ crestwood \\ midlothian neighborhood ( i do not remember the street or which town exactly). i was in the back seat behind the driver, and the other two were in the front. it was dark out and a mostly cloudy evening. at about 11:00 from our position and approximately 45��� above the horizon two of us in the car saw the flash of blue and red lights through the clouds. it lasted for just a fraction of a second. what i saw and what one of my friends saw are slightly different. the third individual did not see anything. he may have closed his eyes at that moment, and it did happen very fast. at least that is the only reason we can figure out as to why he did not see it. what i saw was two rectangular shaped lights (side by side) that burned through the clouds as if the clouds were not there. the one on the left was red and the one on the right was blue. if i were to estimate the ratio of the rectangles, i would say 4 tall by 6 wide. they flashed only once and in succession with a slight overlap. the lights had a strange appearance to them. from what i remember, they appeared to have a very solid appearance. kind of like if your were to take an led light and blow it up to the size of a billboard. it is difficult to explain, but i guess it looked as if it was a gas filled light (kind of like neon or fluorescent) but shaped like a panel, not tubular. as i said, it only lasted a fraction of a second. the clouds, houses, roads, and everything else in the area was lit up like it does when lightening strikes, only it was purple. it was just the one occurrence, and i do not remember hearing any noise. my friend who also saw it (the one who was driving) says that he saw it slightly different. he claims that he saw the same lights moving in a spiral motion around each other as they rose into the sky. i believe that this was just his head movement causing tracer lines or light trails. he was driving and had to direct his vision to see it. i was already looking in the general area and had my head rested against the window of the glass. i think my view was better, but who knows. when we both saw it, we each had a similar kind of ���what the hell?��� type of reaction. the other friend who was in the car did not notice anything. we discussed it for several days, but never reported it. eventually we stopped talking about it because we never could figure out what exactly we saw. the thing that i remember the most about the night was my position in the car; seeing the shape, color, and intensity, of the lights; the flash of purple lightening surrounding the lights, the position in the sky; and my reaction to what i saw. the date, the town, and the road, i am not sure about. i do know it was in the approximate area of (oak forest, crestwood, midlothian), illinois and for some reason, i know that we were driving east. as for whether or not it was extra-terrestrial, terrestrial, or environmental, i have know idea. i tend to lean more toward either strange lightening or even some odd reflection of police lights ( i do not know). i will not be disappointed if i find out that what i saw was not anything otherworldly. i guess i am just wondering it you have ever heard of this type of sighting before. i did some research online for it and i could not find anything that sounded like my story or description. i am just wondering what i did see. any feedback would be appreciated."],"Date of the Event":"11/30/1994 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"13311","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13311.html"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.603812","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Log Number":"US-10282008-0027","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.603812,+-87.740878(13311)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13311) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/30/1994 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Oak Forest","There were no other sightings in Oak Forest on or around November 30th 1994"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
