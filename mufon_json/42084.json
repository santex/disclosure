It made no sound, saw no wings. It never changed speed (which appeared to be 80 mph) and continued straight south until we could not visually see it anymore because of distance...."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"sphere object moving over us. no sound. reflecting sun craft surface. cont South","Log Number":"US-08272012-0033","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42084.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42084.html"],"Object Features":"None","Case Number":"42084","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.909047,+-97.173897(42084)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42084) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Colleyville","There were no other sightings in Colleyville on or around August 27th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"08/27/2012 06:50 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/27/2012 09:48 UTC","Latitude":"32.909047","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
