The next night i set my video up on the table for a few mins looking at the sky i only realised when i returned home the i had actually caught the orb again on camera flying in and out of the top of my screen. The photos are close ups of stills taken from my film.The photo of the orb at night is a digital photo the first i took of the orb."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45095.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45095.html"],"Country":"Canada","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
