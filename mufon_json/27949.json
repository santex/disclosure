I'm not sure what drew our attention to it, it was a long time ago but it was almost as if we just wanted to be outside of the tent at that time. We both instantly thought it was a UFO cause that's exactly what it was could have been alien or secret government craft either or it was UFO. It was quite and very low to the ground aprox. 15 feet above the tree line it flew in then hovered above us for a little bit then crept away gently just like it came in. I would just like to know if there were any other sightings of this same one or the same type of UFO and am wondering if I should by put under hypnosis incase theres something BIG I missed (I hope not)"],"Latitude":"44.721857","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27949.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27949.html"],"City":"Prior Lake","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Case Number":"27949","Date of the Event":"06/18/1997 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-93.416857","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.721857,+-93.416857(27949)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27949) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Prior Lake","There were no other sightings in Prior Lake on or around June 18th 1997"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"Minnesota","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
