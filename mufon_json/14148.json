It was around 8pm. and the way that it moved was in a wierd patteren, and the light was above the clouds and it was massive. The feeling I had was I was just mezmorized, then a couple of days later, I finally told a famly member, and they had said that they recorded a show on UFO sightings, so I watched it and I felt shocked like wow, I really thought I was going out of my mind. I really wish that you help verify what I seen a few nights ago.
