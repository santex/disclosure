Thought it was a shooting star or plane but was below cloud cover and way too fast to be a plane (plus no tail lights or shape). UFO traveled in line with highway, we lost sight of it when it simply disapeared. Again, the best way I can describe it was a very low shooting star...but much faster and brighter."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50720.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50720.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Teardrop","Region":"Connecticut","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.464645,+-73.161867(50720)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50720) map </A>","City":"Southbury","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Southbury","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"09/09/2013 10:11 UTC","Longitude":"-73.161867","Country":"United States","Summary":"UFO appeared like low flying shooting star","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
