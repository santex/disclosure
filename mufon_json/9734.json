To my left across the street I saw a small object enter the atmosphere. It slowly came closer to me, as I could see it had a small white round light on the front of it. When the object was about 150 feet from me it stopped, and then disappeared. The only thing remaining was the light. The object, before disappearing, looked like an irregular gray blob. Its wings were different sizes with uneven protrusions. I watched the light for about 40 seconds before moving on down the street. Thank you. I was not too surprised to see this object being that UFOs are a common ground in my area. Or at least I had many close encounter sightings, almost all in this area."]}
