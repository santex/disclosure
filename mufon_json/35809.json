{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy dad, brother, and I were driving in Massachusetts on our way home. I am always looking at the skies in search of UFOs. During the sunset, I glanced up and noticed two objects moving around the clouds. The objects were so abnormal in their appearance and the way they moved that I immediately concluded they were UFOs. The two objects were very bright and far away but I could tell they were very large. They were both moving very slow staying within a certain radius and constantly changing direction and appeared to mildly change shape. I was excited to see the phenomenon and we pulled over to observe it for awhile. The objects didn't appear to be leaving anytime soon as I watched for awhile so we continued driving. We tried to keep an eye on them as we were moving but trees got in the way of our vision and more clouds were rolling in."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.170897,+-71.364314(35809)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35809) map </A>","Latitude":"42.170897","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"35809","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Millis","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-71.364314","Country":"United States","Region":"Massachusetts","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35809.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35809.html"],"Summary":"Two odd shaped glowing objects moving around clouds.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Millis","Log Number":"US-02142012-0018","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"02/14/2012 06:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval, Teardrop","Date of the Event":"02/12/2012 05:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
