I've just looking to the photos that on of my relatives had put of her Facebook. At the background of one of her photos, I noticed to an unusual dot. I zoomed on that found out that was really something like UFO. I told that to my relative and she said she had saw that to after taking the photo but she doesn't think that it's something important and called me crazy. But I marked anything she said here. Anyway, I reported it on this network, maybe someone else has seen too. That object was something like two black plates or bowls, be put on each other on their edges.
