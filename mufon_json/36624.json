I looked east between my house and the neighbors and I noticed a strange set of lights go by. I heard no noise like a helicopter or plane and I know these noises well. I ran down my driveway and right out into the street and I could see this object move slowly north over town. I called a friend who lives about 1 mile north of me in the direct path of this object and I told him to ge outside or look out his window to see what I am seing. Within the time of me calling my friend and losing sight of the object it must have changed course because he did not see it. I am hoping someone else saw it and is reporting it as well. I am a very rational person who does not sugar coat anything ! I tell it how it is.I have always been interested in the phenomenon but this is my first close up sighting for myself."],"Date Submitted":"03/20/2012 11:05 UTC"}
