We looked up in the sky and saw to the north westa round silvery like object very far away high in the sky. We live by Newarkand Teterboro Airports and are use to seeing airplanes of all shapes and sizes. However, this seemed to be round and silvery. It appeared to me to flash redand blue. My husband doesnt agree. It just seemed to float in a southwesterly direction for a 10 minuted period of time until I couldnt see it anylonger. We dont know what we saw. We do know - it wasnt a plane. I waswondering if anyone else saw it."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.788434","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/01/2002 02:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"North Arlington","Date of the Event":"06/01/2002 02:40 UTC","Summary":"Saw SOMETHING in the sky","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00"}
