(note: it was not reflective.) also, it seemed to be...\"gliding\". there was almost a grace to its flight as it seemed to periodically bank left and right. it was during these subtle maneuvers that the object revealed its only discernible feature: it appeared to have a sharp point in the \"front\". this is to say that the object seemed to converge into a point at its front, much like a hang glider. (note: while its true that (due most likely to distance) i couldnt make out any real shape or features, its no less true that i could tell what the object was not. it was not for example an orb or a triangle or a disc, etc. at best, as far as i could see, it was a \"line\" that, as it appeared to bank left and right a few times (perhaps 2-3 times), seemed to have a pointy front like a hang glider.) having come up with the image of a hang glider, i still struggled with the idea of the object actually being a hang glider. the reasons for this are as follows: 1. the sighting took place in elk grove, california, smack dab in the middle of the central valley. this means that the nearest mountain where it could have been launched from was what, 20 miles or more away? so unless it was launched from a plane (and ive never heard of such a thing), i have no idea how it would be gliding over elk grove unless it had traveled for what seems like an exorbitant distance. 2. while it evoked an image of a hang glider, it didnt really look (or act) like one. there was no obvious sign of a person suspended underneath, it didnt spiral or swoop or appear to change altitude. it simply flew, at what seemed to be a fairly high speed, on a relatively straight heading towards the northeast. 3. as mentioned above, the object appeared to be moving pretty fast. it also appeared to be at a significantly higher altitude than the plane. and even at this perceived altitude it appeared to be moving at a higher velocity. this means that it either really was moving faster than the plane, or that it was much lower (and closer) than i thought, and simply appeared faster. the latter seems less likely however, because if it were true then i should have been able to make out more about the object in terms of shape, color, features, etc. i thought then that perhaps it was a helium balloon. but again, it didnt look or act like the potential explanation it evoked. balloons tend to wobble and float this way and that, and they certainly dont move faster than propeller planes, even on windy days. and today, the day in question, there was very little wind. and of course the object most certainly did not wobble or otherwise act like a balloon in any way. and there is also the not exactly small matter of it moving swiftly and consistently in one direction. so i observed the object for about 2 minutes, after which time i lost sight of it over my house. i then proceeded to tend to my dog, all the while running various possibilities and such through my head. once done with the dog, i went through my house and out onto the street to try and catch another glimpse. alas, it was no longer visible. i can only assume that my estimation of its speed was correct and that in the couple of minutes that i was busy with my dog it had traveled far enough away so as to be obscured from view by the houses across the street. in conclusion: -observed a flying white object for approx 2 mins that looked like an indistinct \"line\". object appeared to bank softly to the left & right 2-3 times, which seemed to reveal a pointed front, similar to a hang glider. (note: object did not otherwise look like a hang glider.) -object appeared to be at least 500 ft in the air. appeared significantly higher in altitude than propeller plane which was concurrently in the sky. -object appeared to be moving faster than the aforementioned plane. -aside from the soft banking, object appeared to maintain altitude and most certainly maintained a general direction of ne. -object showed no characteristics consistent with what i would expect a balloon to exhibit. -object made no discernible noise, released no discernible emissions, had no discernible lights\\features\\coloration (other than its white appearance), and reflected no light. -object appeared to under intelligent control."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"35417","Longitude":"-121.428415","Date Submitted":"02/02/2012 06:13 UTC","Summary":"White; no easily discernible shape or features; might have had sharp point located on","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.411002,+-121.428415(35417)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35417) map </A>","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Elk Grove","There were no other sightings in Elk Grove on or around February 2nd 2012"],"Log Number":"US-02022012-0014","Region":"California"}
