{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on my patio ona beautifly clear day, when I noticed some high flying birds. As iwas watching the birds I noticed off in the distance a star like object but it was broad daylight. As I watched it had a very peculiar movement pattern. So I rushed inside to grab my video camera. I filmed the object for close to five minuets before I lost sight of the object, witch was moving in a general north to south direction. This is the second day in a row to see the same object and I did capture it both days on video..I know that it was not a plane, or bird, or balloon, or helicopter, the only thing I could speculate was that it was a sattelite..The video is very shakey, but when it is paused one can make out the object to a certin degree..I do not know how to up load the video.But I sure wish that some one could take a look at it because I am curious as to what it might be!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.742639,+-97.327581(31600)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31600) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/06/2011 05:34 UTC","Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright rectangular shape..Like a wrist watch, bright reflectiveand round in the middle darkrectangular on top and bottom..","Sighting Duration":"00:23:00","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Longitude":"-97.327581","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"31600","Date Submitted":"09/06/2011 10:33 UTC","City":"Fort Worth","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around September 6th 2011"],"Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31600.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31600.html"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"32.742639","Log Number":"US-09062011-0026","Tags":"City"}
