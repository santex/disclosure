I looked up in the air directly south about 2 miles from the Newport beach Ocean Shoreline and see about 500 feet above me a spinning red egg oval shaped spear spinning craft was flashing brightly different colors of bright lights or they could have been re directed light from the sunlight not sure. I ran outside took about a min or two and looked for the object in the air to my surprise it was spinning alot faster and had ascended out over the ocean and was up about a 1000 feet I showed it to my roommate then about a min later lost sight of it. The UFO was red sphere egg shaped and spinning around slowly at first the object was on a path upward and going south toward the ocean it did seem to be spinning faster as it got higher and was really a very bright light it seemed to be leaving a light emissions trial it was almost like a Christmas tree ornament in every way"],"Case Number":"35601","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Costa Mesa","There were no other sightings in Costa Mesa on or around February 9th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-02102012-0004","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35601.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35601.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.643342,+-117.918897(35601)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35601) map </A>","Summary":"Red oval egg shaped sphear floating or hovering slow spinning and flashing bright lights or reflecting sun light emmision trail assending","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/10/2012 05:48 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:08:00","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Region":"California","City":"Costa Mesa","Source":"MUFON"}
