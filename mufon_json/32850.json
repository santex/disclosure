I was looking in a Southwest direction. I just happened to take my eyes off the plane and saw what looked like a star, but it was moving. That's when I noticed it. At first I thought it might be a satellite or the ISS. It was bluish white, I couldn't make out any structure, but there were no hazard or warning lights blinking. Using the horizon as the six oclock position, it was at 3oclock moving from Southwest to the South. My feeling was oh no here we go again, I have seen similar objects in the past, totaling 4 times, I even videotaped one event that happened July of 2010. I lost sight of the object as it headed south. It just seemed to fly off in the distance. This all took place in about 12 to 15 seconds."],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/24/2011 06:55 UTC","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Riverside","There were no other sightings in Riverside on or around October 24th 2011"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.961819,+-117.392876(32850)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32850) map </A>","Longitude":"-117.392876"}
