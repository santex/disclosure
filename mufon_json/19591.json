Could not figure out what I was looking at but knew it was not a star or an aircraft. I thought that it was a UFO have seen such things before out here in the mountains of west Texas. So I went inside to get my wife and my binoculars. My wife took a look in the binoculars and could not explain what it was other than it was stationary in the sky with falshing white lights. Then it took off eastward fairly fast and the light were spinning and flashing then headed southeast out of sight. At some point the lights flashing were red then white and then maybe a blue or green. I then felt relieved that I was not the only one to see this and that I was not just going crazy. The other sitings I had been alone. Watched the object until it could no longer be seen from my backyard. Took some video of the event."],"Date of the Event":"11/30/2002 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
