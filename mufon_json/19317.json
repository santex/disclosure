{"Object Shape":"Diamond","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-09142009-0016","City":"Evansville","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"19317","divs":["Sighting DetailsI live very near the Evansville Regional Airport and see planes often. This object came from the NE and made a slow circle above our home and headed SE in nearly the direction it came. It looked as if two dark diamonds were placed end to end. It had colored lights on each tip and a center row of white lights running along the underneath. It was moving slow enough to go in and grab my wife. She came out and it was directly above our house. She said, \"What is that? I've never seen anything like it before.\" It almost looked like a floating platform and was extremely large in size. It was a very quiet craft except for a slight humming noise. Not sure what it was, but it was definitely unlike anything I've ever seen in the sky. If it was military, let's hope it's on our side."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.973559,+-87.5618(19317)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19317) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/14/2009 10:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19317.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19317.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"Diamond Shaped FlyOver","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Evansville","There were no other sightings in Evansville on or around September 14th 2009"],"Longitude":"-87.5618","Date of the Event":"09/14/2009 09:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"37.973559"}
