An hour later it was still there. I took my camera and set it on a tripod and took two photos. He asked me to take photos of this light because he had never seen it there.

It is an object with three dimensions which radiate black rays from the top and bottom and colored gold, orange and yellow rays from the side. The center is very white bright.
