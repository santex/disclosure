It moved away making no noise and vanished in seconds I said to ny wife who was with me I wish I had a camera.We moved on a few paces and a second object appeared the same shape and colour and moving toward the spot where the first object had been. The objects seemed to move quite fast and the second one was soon out of sight. We were about ten miles from Luton airport and are used to seeing planes overhead, these objects did not look like planes nor did they move like planes. When I first saw the object I thought it could be a plane but it was different enough for me to continue looking, my wife thought it might be a hot air balloon but I said it is moving to fast and I do not think they are allowed to fly at night."],"Log Number":"GB-06202010-0019","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"England","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Hitchin","Country":"United Kingdom","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23849.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23849.html"],"Longitude":"-0.283414","Date Submitted":"06/20/2010 06:03 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Walking home this evening I saw orange lights in the sky the shape was triangular the base of that triangle was curved."}
