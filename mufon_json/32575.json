The light object was coming from the south. Just like a star bright stedy light. It was coming from the South direction heading North a bit to the east. Going slowly and no sound at all. Light was very bright and low alost like the altitude of a helicopter. This was not a helicopter. After stairing at it moving after about 30 - 40 seconds, it changed color to an orange redish color for about 5 seconds and began dimming fading to black to what looked like a black shadow and disapears. Sky had no clouds so it did not hide behind a cloud. It seemed to have past over Clark road in the Northwest area of Orlando close to Ocoee. At first I wasnt sure of what it could be, I couldnt take my eyes off of it because I was curious what it could be."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.544366,+-81.376116(32575)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32575) map </A>","Longitude":"-81.376116","Date of the Event":"10/13/2011 08:10 UTC","Log Number":"US-10132011-0012","City":"Orlando","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Star Like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32575.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32575.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/13/2011 08:58 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"28.544366","Case Number":"32575","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
