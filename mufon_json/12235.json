needs a special bread they make there, while we live in fulton. going south on 481 from fulton to shopping plaza along 31, near great northern mall. there aren't any airports near by that i know of unless there are private ones. it's mostly cows and trees and houses. i think it was around the time on the radio 92.1 that they were playing a journey song, which i thought was great and funny because journey is well, journey. anyway. as passing phoenix exit (14) notice oncoming car with bright headlights up on bridge overhead, but not moving, to the left. as i get closer, i notice lights are far above bridge in the air, looks like one of those towers lit up at night. i think i don't remember a tower nearby, but dismiss it because i'm not the most observant guy. lights are a warm white light, bright and big, like old headlights, not the cold, bluish new headlights, lamps or something on the tower. it's dark out, but not completely, clear with stars, and a few distinct clouds. i keep driving, and lights are motionless like at the top of a tower, the same kind of height, so trees are blocking it as i drive. eventually i see another tower on the left, one of those thin towers with little red lights running up it, near what i'm seeing so i have a bit of reference. i can barely make out the tower behind the lights in the darkness, but i can clearly see sky and clouds beneath these lights as i glimpse it through breaks in the trees. as i finally get about even with the lights, near the other tower, the \"headlights\" immediately and clearly began moving west, toward me and the highway. it was very low, like i said about the height of a tower, and fairly large. my side of the highway was relatively clear, more traffic in the northbound lane, so i could afford to slow right down to about 40 miles an hour. the thing came right across 481 and over the top of my car. i was not breathing or thinking, just looking at this weird thing. i hunched up over the wheel of the car and was craning my neck like a loony to get a glimpse of this thing but not wreck the car. i kind of wish i pulled over but i didn't want to. as it passed low and directly over the car, a few things hit me-how close and big it was-and how it looked like a plane coming in for a landing right over the car into the field on the other side of the road, but it didn't look like a plane at all. the size of the lights and the fact that none of them were blinking were disturbing to me. i've seen planes and helicopters at night my whole life, but this thing gave me a weird feeling in my stomach. most of all the lack of noise-at that closeness there should have been some plane or helicopter sounds i thought. also the fact that it appeared to go from completely motionless to movement right over my car. so i'm thinking i must have been driving for 7 or eight minutes directly into the path of this plane so it looked like it wasn't moving, but none of these things just didn't seem right, especially because the highway does bend a bit. as it passed over me, i'm looking for blinky lights and see none. three big bright whitish lights at the points (what looked like two headlights from the side) underneath, with a vague black triangle outline against the sky, and a mess of red, non-blinking lights underneath. what i didn't like about this was they were not aligned along a normal plane-like straight line, it was more suggesting it was along the bottom of this triangle shape. it was lighting up the belly very clearly, so i'm thinking \"okay, that's where the plane's landing gears and stuff are\" because i could see weird details, but they didn't register in my mind because i couldn't make sense out of what i was looking at. 481 is a 4 lane highway, two north and two south lanes. i'm going forty miles an hour, and it took about six seconds to pass over my car and head into the field behind trees on the other side. by this time i'm coming up on the exit onto 31 where great northern mall and wegman's and all those stores are. i keep glancing to the right and see little glimpses of the lights through the trees and the thing is banking toward the same direction i'm heading in, so i think i'll see it when i get to the intersection. i'm thankful for the red light because i can roll my windows down and try to listen, but all i hear is the car traffic and noise and the whole strip is lit up with all these stores and malls. the thing is still there though, and it's cruising low but across 31 and past. i turn right on 31 toward wegmans and keep peeking because it's hard to concentrate and i don't want to crash the car. i head through another intersection and that's where i see it last, it went from cruising around fast in an arc, now on my left, and i see it in the air through an opening in an intersections, maybe a quarter\\half mile further south, where it had stopped moving again. i felt a little nuts at this point and didn't want to follow it, plus i knew i'd get lost if i went after it in that direction. so i went and got the groceries in a fog. that probably took twenty minutes. on the way home, i went back up north 481 and didn't see anything except i thought it was weird that there were 3 helicopters or planes or something in the area when i came back. they were higher up in the sky, normal blinky aircraft, but circling around in that area. that's all hope this helps, it was one of the weirdest things i've seen. i've only told my sister, wife, and dad, because i know no one will really believe me and i don't want people to make fun of me or think i'm a nutjob or people at work to find out and have a field day with me."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12235.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12235.html"],"Viewing
