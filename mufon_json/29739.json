On January 21,2011 at the time of 18:24:50, my wife and I was laying on our bed and watching a movie. There had a very bright light on my front yard that I noticed on my TV monitor which I used for my security cameras.I did not know what I was looking at because I have never seen nothing like this. It was so amazeing to have this happened to me, I have never seen a light so bright in my life. This light was round in shape, the light was changing in shape to a star like figure. Than I noticed an image that looked like a person below the light with some type of craft under this person. Than all of the sudden the craft flew right towards my camera and was gone. I also have a perfect round white circle flying across my backyard recorded.
