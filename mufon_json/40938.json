I looked up (roughly 30 degrees above the horizon) towards the northeast. when I saw a line with some lights on the end. I wear glasses, so I took them off and rubbed my eyes and it was still there. The best way to describe it was a long light (like a cold cathode tube or florescent light with two glowing LED lights on the end. I noticed no blinking, no movement when I tilted my head or moved a down a few stairs. I grabbed my cellphone and was preparing to record what I was seeing. When I looked up, the object was gone. It could have been an airplane, but there was no movement, none of the usual indicator lights, nor any sound."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/19/2012 10:53 UTC","Summary":"Line with two glowning ends.","City":"Salt Lake City","Log Number":"US-07192012-0022","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/19/2012 08:01 UTC","Longitude":"-111.886157","Latitude":"40.767389","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.767389,+-111.886157(40938)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40938) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40938.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40938.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Region":"Utah","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
