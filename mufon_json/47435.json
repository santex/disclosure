We hit (around) the 64th mile marker. There is a mountain range. Disk appeared to our right above the mountain range. Shaped just like a UFO that is depicted in movies and whatnot. It was bright, bright silver emitting a trail of light that was also silver and outlined in green, as was the UFO. It was as if it wanted us to see it. Moved way too fast for any plane, but slower than a shooting star. After we saw it, the Moon began to do some strange things. It was very bright at first on our far right, then within less than a minute the moon moved to our far left and got very small. It moved quickly to the right again."],"Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Dome","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Asheville","Summary":"Was driving with my girl home to Asheville from the beach.
