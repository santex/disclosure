Suddenly I saw a bright reflective shiny object shoot across the sky NW to SE faster than anything I have ever seen. It was very bright, like a star at night. The sun was shining. I have a tree in front of my patio and when it went behind the branches, I lost it. It took a second or two for me to register what I might have seen.
