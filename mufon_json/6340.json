It was a flourescent green light that was almost a sphere but because of all the light and its brief fall iam not sure its exact shape. But it straightened out and then begin to fall again, and we never saw it land or crash or anything and we drove around a little bit to see if we could spot anything else but we never did so we went back home. (When I saw the object I felt amazement and wonder.)"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Case Number":"6340","Object Shape":"Sphere, Teardrop","Source":"MUFON"}
