{"divs":["sighting detailsi was in a car sitting shotgun while my father drove. we were headed up to crockett from austin to visit the my grandparents. i noticed the object and immediately said 'is that a ufo?!' it was a small metallic sphere. a little larger than a bb from a bb gun. it was silver\\grey in color and kind of reflecting the sunlight. it was completely stationary and made no sound. i would guess that it was maybe a mile away, maybe 30 degrees from the horizon in the eastern sky. i observed it for about 30 seconds and then it went from being silver metallic in luster to a dark grey and not reflective at all. as we were driving some trees obscured my view for maybe three or four seconds. after we had passed the trees the object had vanished. i am curious if anyone else noticed this object. i recall that there were power lines between myself and the object. i think we had been driving for an hour or so but i cannot be sure which town we were passing through when i noticed the object."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"small metallic sphere. stationary.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45993.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45993.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"02/07/2013 04:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.270343,+-97.739941(45993)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45993) map </A>","Country":"United States","City":"Austin","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There were no other sightings in Austin on or around February 7th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"03/02/2013 02:05 UTC","Latitude":"30.270343","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"45993","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-97.739941","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-03022013-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
