I sat at a light on a suburban downtown street, with only moderate traffic, but when I put the window down, there was no audible sound. Mind you, I was on a street in the downtown, but this is not a big city, and I would have easily been able to hear if it was a helicopter, or airplane. Plus, there's no airport nearby. I decided to investigate farther, and I went around the block, but by then, the object was nowhere to be seen."],"City":"Rochester","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"01/19/2010 06:25 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
