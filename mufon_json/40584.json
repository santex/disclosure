I always look up at the night sky and just happend to notice somthing that looked like a star going out. I thought it was a star going out. It looked like a white star that was randomly flashing, and every time it would flash it was in a different location. It seemed to move in a tringular pattern. I felt rather excited to see it at first when i saw it. Then when i realized i we did not know what it was i started to feel unsure of my surroundings. When i finnaly lost sight of the object it had stoped flashing all together."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Woodbridge","There were no other sightings in Woodbridge on or around July 7th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"07/08/2012 12:46 UTC"}
