{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I had just stepped out for a smoke and were chatting and leaning on a car. as we stared into the sky it was cloudless and we were both immediately drawn to one star. 30 seconds after we looked up i asked him \"You looking at that one?\" and pointed it out. He replied \"yah its crazy looking\" as we both watched, transfixed, it appeared to turn red, then green, and shades of blue, while also pulsating light, like a star, but much more mechanical looking. I then asked \"Now tell the truth, does it look like its figure eighting?\" all he could say was \"holy ****. i was gonna ask the same thing but thought i was crazy.\" at about the 15 minute mark it got very, very bright, almost as if it was a far, far, away sun. we stared for about half an hour before it seemed to dim out. we seemed to forget about it, but now every time i run into him its all we talk about. also their are many many fields near by."],"Log Number":"US-02142011-0003","Case Number":"27807","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.196807","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"07/12/2008 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.866617,+-122.196807(27807)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27807) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"02/14/2011 03:24 UTC","Latitude":"47.866617","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Mill Creek","There were no other sightings in Mill Creek on or around July 12th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27807.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27807.html"],"Summary":"Star like UFO began to flash different colors and figure eight","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Mill Creek","Region":"Washington"}
