She called and said she was looking at some \"weird\" disc shapes in the sky and they were appearing, becoming large, then disapprearing. I ran upstairs and looked out the window over Lake Michigan and to my amazment there were these white-colored disks apprearing over the horizon and coming closer and then going back and disappearing. There also seemed to be the twinkle of lights as the objects moved laterally. At one point there were 15 or so objects in the sky. These objects would appear and disappear. As the sun rose over the horizon, one by one, the objects began to move back to the horizon like and disappeared. This was the first time I have witnessed anything of the sort. I was pretty shocked by what I saw!"],"Summary":"Several disks over the horizon"}
