As always i looked up to see the stars and saw a craft flying slowly directly overhead. there was no sound, the only light was the light from the stree lights etc. reflecting off the craft. As soon as I saw it I yelled inside for my relatives to come see. The only one to get out in time was my son. He saw the craft but not in the detail I did when it was right over head. I really want to know what this thing was. This is a heavily populated area. there must have been other witnesses who also seen this."],"Latitude":"40.174276","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Wings","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hatboro","There were no other sightings in Hatboro on or around December 24th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"12/25/2011 04:13 UTC","City":"Hatboro","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"34295","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
