{"Date of the Event":"06/26/2005 09:45 UTC","Case Number":"3518","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-06282005-0005","City":"San Diego","Latitude":"32.724649","Date Submitted":"06/26/2005 09:45 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsat 9:30-9:45pm, i was preparing to leave for work. i work at a company which is located reasonably close to miramar marine corp station. just before opening my car door, i saw a bright light on the western horizon -- about two to three times as bright as jupiter. thinking it was a plane, i stopped, and watched as it approached. usually, f-18s are landing about this time at night. as the vehicle started to come into better view, i noticed a few odd things about the vehicle: 1) both right- and left-hand wing lights were white, and about the same intensity as the front light. normal airplanes will tend to have a red\\green light combination instead. 2) the right-hand \"wing\" light was strobing more or less once every two seconds. the red strobe followed, synchronized, approximately half-second after. typical airplane strobes are located on both wings, and never on the underbelly of a fuselage, and tend to strobe concurrently or in bursts (e.g., three flashes, then no flashes for about a second, etc). 3) the red strobe was located in the geometric center of the lights, which is quite an unusual location to put any airplane 'red light'. 4) regardless of the location in the sky, all lights were uniform in brightness, and all strobes could be seen plainly. that is, the lights this thing produced were omni-directional, not focused forward like in normal aircraft. as it got closer, my suspicions were confirmed as it made absolutely, positively, 100% no sound what-so-ever. the air was still, except for the occasional gentle breeze. the vehicle also was flying relatively low; its arc-width in the sky appeared to be similar to that of an f-18, but made no attempts to lower its altitude at all. for this reason, i cannot even begin to guess how far away this object was. it was completely silent as traveled by towards the east, in a straight line. total transit time was approximately 15 to 20 seconds. i lost sight of it after it went behind some trees. very excited that i saw my first flying triangle, i wanted to get home and write an e-mail to my father about this incident. after arriving home, at approximately 10:15, i got out of the car, and looked up (i almost always do this anyway, being an amateur astronomy buff). lo and behold, there were both normal airplanes (which made distinct noises) and *three* flying triangles traveling in the sky over my street. the triangles at home lacked any strobes of any kind. just three white lights, forming equilateral triangles, gliding noiselessly in the sky. this was easily confirmed after all normal aircraft had left the area, and all that remained were triads of moving lights without sound. one was making a course change in the form of a wide, sweeping, graceful arc. the other two were flying in straight lines, normal to each other in their respective geometric planes. they were lower in altitude than the normal aircraft flying in the area, as the a plane that went behind one of the triangles was occulted by the flying triangle. they were also higher in altitude than the first triangle i saw while leaving work, however. despite this, they were actually moving *faster* in the sky than the first triangle i've seen. however, their speeds were consistent, and showed no evidence of zigging, zagging, or other characteristically \"ufo\" flight patterns. i lost sight of each of these triangles as they also disappeared behind trees or approached the horizon. total display time here was about 1.5 minutes, estimated. the eerie thing about this was that i wasn't frightened at all. and while i enjoyed the display, i wasn't mesmorized by it. odd as it may sound, and usually quite contrary to most ufo reportings i've read previously, my life just went on as normal, quite confident that i'll be seeing more of these in the future, and that there is absolutely nothing \"wrong\" or out of place with these things. they are easily confused for airplanes by people who don't know how to tell the difference, so i suspect that these things are just all over the place, and most people don't realize what they're seeing. from now on, i will be keeping a digital camera in my car, just in case this happens again. i would love to snap a few pictures next time i see one. thanks."],"Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.724649,+-117.154255(3518)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3518) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3518.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3518.html"],"Longitude":"-117.154255","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"4 Flying Triangles;
