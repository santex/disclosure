it picked up speed and shot to the ground. at that point i said to [pid], \"that [pd] is crashing son\" ... then it shot up in the sky and i remember saying \"we wont see no more\" i was disappointed. while we were on that bridge we could see people in other cars pointing at it and when we came off the bridge cars were pulling over looking. we kept on going. it was a good thing we kept going. when we thought the ufo was gone we were sitting down in shock. i remember hearing someone light up a cigarette that is how quiet the car was. i was in shock i was just holding the camera out the window. i wasn't shooting anything in particular i was just in shock i couldn't move. after a while i remember someone saying that is some crazy [pd]. and it was. i can still remember [pid] asking if it was a full moon that night and it was. i called our editor and told him that i just shot the greatest ufo footage ever. he hung up on me i cant blame him though. we got back to orlando. i left the tape with the editor and he called me later and told me that i did shoot the greatest ufo footage ever. he was so excited he told me that there were a few more thing that we missed. after we thought the ufo crashed it was following us. i watched the tape and i was so surprised. he slowed it down frame by frame and showed me the ufo flying ahead of us. he showed me where the ufo really left. it flew behind a building and it looked like a shooting star. he also showed me something else some sort of light appeared on the skyline during the light show. it appears to fly behind a building. i have no way of telling if it flew behind the building or not. it could have been an illusion. regardless it was there on the tape none of us noticed it on the bridge. we came up with a plan. we posted a short video of the incident on our blip.tv page, myspace and youtube. the response was overwhelming. long story story short the video got picked up on wftv.com (orlando's abc affiliate) we got the footage copy written and we prepared for a media storm. \"not on our radar at all,\" lt. rebecca heyse, public affairs officer for macdill air force base, told wftv.com, adding that they have no reports of similar sightings on january 20. wow the air force had no idea that something was flying around a major city. a few days later wftv reported on its site that a t-6 plane used in the bill leff starfire night skyshow, was flying that day. wow this flame in the sky that wasn't on the air force,s rader was now a plane. i was like wow this is a cover up. i googled bill leff and watched his air show on youtube.com its a great air show but it looks like nothing that i taped on the 20th of jan 20008. they were trying to debunk us. i knew what was up then it had to be a grass roots movement to get this out to the people. it became a passion of mine because i want to know whats going on. if the government knows they need to disclose this to us because we have a right to know. i have been in touch with bill birnes form ufo magazine and history channels ufo hunters show. i cant tell if they want to show the truth or just show poorly shot footage of suspected ufox and having people talk about their experiences with no evidence. we are putting this out for the world to see. check out bill leff's airshow and compare it to what we saw. air shows are loud this thing i in the sky that we saw made no noise. air shows are held at night this happened before night fell over the sky. this incident has changed all of us that were in the car that day. [pid] already a respected artist in the orlando scene and an award winning mc has shifted her music to more spiritual rhymes. she is on a mission to share her truth with the wold through her music. she is one of the few rappers that has actually brought up ufos in her music. she is constantly on a mission to find and share the truth . [pid] life has been affected as well as his music. as for me i'm trying to bring the truth out i don't care about what it is if its police brutality that i see and shoot with my camera ill bring that to the world if its a ufo ill bring that to the wold to. i ask everyone to look at this video make an informed decision and remember that if we don't demand the truth the government will continue to lie. i have no idea what that was but it was no plane and ill keep saying that to my grave. you can view the video for yourself ..menttelelvision.blip.tv and you can reach me at myspace.com\\supreme407 or movementtelevision@gmail.com"],"Date Submitted":"01/20/2008 06:30 UTC"}
