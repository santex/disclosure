They rose at a steady rate of speed, and maintained mostly a straight course up. Yes, this was July 4th, but we feel strongly they were not fireworks due to the time of their ascent - over a minute, and also they disappeared behind a thin layer of high clouds. I have seen a missile launch from Cape Canaveral while in Orlando, and these objects most closely resembled rocket launches in my opinion. They rose at a steady rate of speed, then disappeared beyond the high clouds. I did film them, but after watching my footage I wish I had done a much better job of filming."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Three orange-yellow glowing orbs rising in eastern sky.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17852.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17852.html"],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 09:45 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.139212,+-93.378781(17852)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17852) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 09:45 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Clear Lake","There were no other sightings in Clear Lake on or around July 4th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"Iowa","Case Number":"17852","Longitude":"-93.378781"}
