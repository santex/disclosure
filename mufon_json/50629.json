{"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Waterloo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"divs":["Sighting DetailsFriday September 6 2013 at approximately 8:30 pm my husband and I were driving to the bookstore. We were in our car travelling north on King Street in Waterloo when my husband noticed a unusual number of orange yellow lights in the night sky above and in front of us and brought my attention to them. We thought initially these must be aeroplanes and how strange it was to see that many planes so close together. They appeared to be star-orb shaped but much bigger than stars flying west to east. The yellowy orange lights remained solid, they didn't flash. They appeared to be flying in twos at the same altitude but in no specific formation, sort of staggered and irregularly spaced. I observed one of the first three lights move quickly and close to another light ahead of it. We initially counted six lights but soon spotted another four following. We kept driving on our same course and lost sighting in the cloud cover. We felt puzzled as to what we had just witnessed. It was unlike anything either of us had ever seen before. Approximately 45 min after the sighting we saw an aeroplane in the sky as we exited the book store. It had the typical 3 lights, blue red and white and middle one was flashing. It was definitely not the same type of object in comparison to what we had seen earlier."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Date Submitted":"09/07/2013 10:43 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50629.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50629.html"],"City":"Waterloo","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/06/2013 08:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","Summary":"Nine or more orange lights moving seemingly in pairs west to east","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.48847","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.48847,+-80.530391(50629)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50629) map </A>","Longitude":"-80.530391","Case Number":"50629","Log Number":"CA-09072013-0017","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ontario","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
