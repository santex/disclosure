We were at the top of a hill. She noticed the lights first then I did. We drove down the hill slowly, they went out of sight so we turned around to go back and we could still see them. We drove down the hill to go to the top of the next hill to try and see them better and then they were gone. She thought they may be meteors or even missiles, but I've seen meteors and falling stars and they did not move like that. I have never seen anything like this in my life. I think they were either extraterrestrials (chills were all over my arms talking about it to my neighbors)..... Don't think the government can make things like that. If you YouTube orange lights in the sky tonight, that looks just like what we saw, only there were only 7-8 of them."],"Case Number":"42461","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42461.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42461.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Missouri","Summary":"I was driving and saw 7-8 bright orange circular shapes lights floating slowly in and across the sky","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09102012-0033","Longitude":"-91.822293","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
