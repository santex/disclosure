I always have my eye on the sky, and this was strange to me. It was a giant red ball, the size was disproportionate to its elevation. So it was either really low, or extremely big. It was moving VERY SLOW across the sky, and was glowing. No flashing lights, which would indicate it wasnt a helicopter, Couldnt have been an airplane due to its spherical shape. Never seen something like this before."],"City":"Raleigh","Date Submitted":"10/31/2011 02:20 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-78.631014","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
