I can say it was like a chevron or triangle and it was being hauled on a very long traier longer the most eighteen wheeler's? The tarp itself was covering the object which was tied down to the trailer with metal straps all around it? It did have a very distinct noise everytime the truck moved it kind of hummed? Also I noticed that when it went by there was a very noticible electricle feeling? Like static? This by the way was on a USAF SAC Base. Don't know if you will belive me or not but I have kept this to myself since 1986 and I am 44 now and thought someone should know about it? Also I will be happy to answer any questions you may have in person only not over the land line please? I just don't anyone to think I am nus.
