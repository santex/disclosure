(same tree and same bird) i've sent these images to friends and family and we thought perhaps jet had been scrambled to check out or intercept this black ufo. i should also add this. i am very meticulous about my equipment. i clean my lens before every shoot. also there were no reflective objects or surfaces in front of or anywhere near the camera. only a large field. i know we could be reaching, but these photos do show what look to be two jets and a very strange object, with one of the jets near the object and the other performing an abnormal maneuver. what do you guys think?"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:00","Longitude":"-84.364206","Case Number":"32920","Summary":"Photographed flying objects unknowingly","Region":"Ohio","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other,Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around October 25th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"10/25/2011 03:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32920.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32920_submitter_file1__IMG_1243-Version3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32920_submitter_file2__IMG_1244-Version2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32920_submitter_file3__IMG_1243-Version4.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32920.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Monroe"}
