Thirty ninth and Roanoke for those who know the area. We stopped and got out to really get a good look. It looked like a perfect black sphere with orange fire rolling around it. This struck us as odd because of how low the clouds were. The object appeared to move of its own accord. We were looking south and the object moved from the west of us to directly south in front of us before it made a ninety degree turn up into the clouds. What is going on here? Something happened on July 4th. I thought I was crazy until I read everyone elses posts."],"Date Submitted":"07/20/2009 01:09 UTC","Case Number":"18193","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.102606,+-94.576317(18193)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18193) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were no other sightings in Kansas City on or around"]}
