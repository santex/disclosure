At first it was stationary , but then itstarted to cruise north easterly. I observed it thinking it was maybe a militaryplane or something, I was extremely curious at this point because after a fewseconds it just stopped and it stayed in the same spot in the sky for about 15or 20 minutes , thats when I totally realized it wasnt an ordinary aircraft. Theobject resembled a pulsating star but, in the middle of the day no it wasnt theplanet Mars this was way different in appearance"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Oakland","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2616.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2616.html"],"Weather Factors":"Windy","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
