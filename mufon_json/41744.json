Sinai Hospital on Miami Beach. I'm also homeless. I sleep inmy car in the employee parking lot, which overlooks the bay. This evening I decided to stand on the bay and throw rocks in the water. I picked up four rocks and skidded them on the water. As i turned to pick up more rocks something bright in the sky caught my eye. I looked up and there were THREE ORBS IN THE SKY FORMING A TRIANGLE. I looked for about 10 seconds in sheer amazement and then ran to my car to retrieve my camera, which was in my front seat in my computer bag. I came back and snapped 6 pictures and then my camera started acting funny... it went into a 5 second delay setting, which I had NEVER set and then went dead. I had just recharged the battery and had only taken about 35 pictures total. I found that odd."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41744.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41744.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"08/14/2012 10:55 UTC","Region":"Florida","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.671427,+-81.507514(41744)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41744) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/13/2012 09:10 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Case Number":"41744","Latitude":"27.671427","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00"}
