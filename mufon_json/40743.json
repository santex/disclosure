When I was about 9 or 10 I lived in a house that was on a golf course named arroyo del oso. My brothers and I played on it all the time. One starry night I was out on the course playing around. 2. I looked up at the stars and the teardrop object was significantly larger than the stars and obviously in the atmospher. 3. I was very young and only found it to be strange. I didn't think of it as a UFO until years later But I was fascinated by it and couldn't take my eyes off it. 4. Large bright blue teardrop shaped object. It hovered motionless in the sky for a minute or two and then in an instant it moved from being above me to being right above the Sandia crest and then disappeared. 5.
