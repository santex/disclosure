{"Log Number":"US-05292012-0007","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had got up to let the dog out and he didn't want to go out so I stepped outside and noticed a glowing orange white light over the back yard above the trees. It didn't make a sound. In fact the air was quiet with no frogs croaking. The sky was clear. If I held out my pointer finger the object would be the smaller than a #2 pencil eraser. As I watched it fly it seemed to wobbled for lack of a better word just slightly. As it moved across the sky North by slightly East when it got behind the tree it made a slight right and proceeded on a more Easterly course. I live under one of the flight paths at Sea Tac Airport and an occasional fly by from Joint Base Lewis McChord but this wasn't one of those aircraft. As I watched it fly away when it disappeared from view the neighbors dog barked and the frogs started croaking again"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in University Place","There were no other sightings in University Place on or around May 29th 2012"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"47.242794","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.242794,+-122.549014(38609)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38609) map </A>","City":"University Place","Summary":"Orangish white glowing light","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"Washington","Case Number":"38609","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/29/2012 07:53 UTC","Longitude":"-122.549014","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38609.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38609.html"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"05/29/2012 03:51 UTC"}
