It was there and it didnt look normal, like it wassomething from a movie or whatever. Marco wanted to leave so he got in the carand tried to start it but it wouldnt go. Jake went after him but I just stoodthere. Then jake came back and these two things came out from behind it (likethey came out the back side and walked around) Then these two things cametowards us and one had a metal sheet in its hand. Then the looked at us for likea few minutes and left. We went back to the car and Marco had fallen asleep sowe woke him up and drove off, and we were all like calm and all but it wasunbelievable."]}
