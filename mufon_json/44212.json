We were heading south on I-435 and saw a somewhat circular, pulsing white light facing us; object appeared to be stationary and at about 200 feet above the ground. On the south side, steady red lights came into view on it as we drove south. The entire object was stationary. We continued driving south and lost sight of it. When we returned on the same route but going north, about an hour and 20 minutes later, there was still strange activity -- shimmering white lights, and red and blue lights (fainter) up about the same height, stationary, but further west. Also, a plane flew above it and turned north, while the white-lights-object remained in place. Shortly the object began moving slowly north, then gained speed. As it did, a helicopter also flew into the area where the object had been, and also turned north."],"Latitude":"39.090954","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44212.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44212.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11282012-0022","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","City":"Kansas City"}
