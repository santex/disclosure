{"Case Number":"9294","Date Submitted":"01/26/2008 04:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","divs":["Sighting Details I. was attending a Stan Romaneck lecture at the Auraria campus on January 26, 2008 with a large group of people in the auditorium. At about 4 p.m., the lecturer declared a break and the audience went outside to get a breath of fresh air and stretch their legs. When I went outside I noted many of the attendees were looking skyward in a north easterly direction. I looked in this direction and saw three very small pinpoints of light. They seemed to be standing still in the sky. The portion of the sky that they appeared in was bright blue, and there were clouds on either side of the pinpoints of light but not close enough to obscure them. eventually two of the pinpoints disappeared and only one remained. A few seagulls were noted at high altitude, flying to and fro in the area but were different looking from the pinpoints of light. The seagulls did not appear to be disturbed by the presence of the UFOs that seemed further away than the birds. I felt excited by the wiew and I went inside to get my wife, who was standing in line for the ladies room and brought her out to see. Unfortunately, she was not able to visualize the pinpoints of light.There were at least 20 to 30 other observers in the area with me at the time and some of them were taking pictures. The temperature was about 40���, and there was only a gentle breeze blowing and viewing conditions were excellent. When we returned to the lecture hall ,the lecturer asked how many people had seen the unidentified flying objects at the break. At least 80% of the audience raised their hands"],"Region":"Colorado","City":"Denver","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9294.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9294_submitter_file3__ScannedImage-3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9294.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"01/26/2008 04:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01272008-0011","Latitude":"39.745754","Longitude":"-104.977783","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"A group seeing some UFO's in the day time sky in a public place","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were 2 other sightings in Denver on or around January 26th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.745754,+-104.977783(9294)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9294) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
