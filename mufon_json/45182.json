I looked up and noticed a bright object in the tree line. AT first I thought it was an airplane, but noticed there was no noise and it wasnt moving in any direction. As I was looking at it, I also noticed it getting brighter and brighter as it was hovering there. It started from a dull orange and gradually got brighter and brighter to a brilluant white. So bright that I had to squint my eyes. I took more pictures of it and when I looked down to see them on my phone, I looked up and it was gone. It all lasted about 15 minutes."],"Date of the Event":"01/10/2013 11:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45182.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45182.html"],"Case Number":"45182","Log Number":"US-01132013-0011","Longitude":"-90.508614","Date Submitted":"01/13/2013 06:30 UTC","Latitude":"38.795088","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in St. Charles","There were no other sightings in St. Charles on or around January 10th 2013"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Missouri","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"St. Charles","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States"}
