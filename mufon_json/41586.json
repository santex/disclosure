I'm looking to the east, at Jupiter and Aldebaran. I'm looking up at the sky every 5-10 seconds, and suddenly I see a new light \"to the right\" of Jupiter. It's almost twice the size of Jupiter and significantly brighter. It shines with a rough corona and sparkles, even with stratus clouds around (behind?) it. It's stationary and doesn't appear to move. I stop and observe the light, a few seconds later it uniformly fades away, over the course of 8 seconds or so. It piqued my interest as possibly being extra-dimensional, but had no adverse reaction on me. What made it so unusual is how it disappears so uniformly. I observed the same light, the same behavior, at or near the same point in the sky about a week ago during the same period of time."],"City":"Columbia","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-08092012-0013","Longitude":"-92.347866","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41586.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41586.html"],"Summary":"Stationary light vanishes","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Missouri","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/09/2012 03:50 UTC","Case Number":"41586","Latitude":"38.920249","Tags":"City"}
