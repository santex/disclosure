I'm located in south Tampa and was looking east when I noticed a bright orange flame. My initial impression was a rocket booster flame but it didn't appear to be ascending. I just happened to be using a telescope and quickly turned it towards the object. It was a cylinder with a flame coming out one end. What was unusual about the object was that it appeared to be tumbling. Like a spent rocket booster falling back to earth but this object was moving upwards. I tracked it for about 2 minutes as it rose up in the sky and then moved directly over head towards the west before disappearing in the clouds. The object was illuminated internally and moved quickly across the sky once it reached altitude."],"Case Number":"22424","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-03212010-0010","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.953755,+-82.456108(22424)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22424) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/21/2010 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Summary":"Witnessed a tumbling cylinder with an internal glow and a flame out one end.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22424.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22424.html"],"Object Shape":"Cylinder","Source":"MUFON"}
