I noticed nothing unusual. A few days later I viewed the photographs and noticed a strange anomolous golden teardropshaped object in the top of a few of the photographs. I thought it was a camera error of some sort - and still consider this as a possibility - exept when I looked closely there is a shadow behind the object!!! I have photos of the same view in my living room taken minutes later where the object does not exist! Maybe someone can tell me what this is."],"Disposition":"Hoax","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Coalinga","There were no other sightings in Coalinga on or around October 8th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10172008-0008","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.147648,+-120.35845(13092)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13092) map </A>","Summary":"I was taking pictures of my living room and kitchen with a new camera.","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Case Number":"13092","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California"}
