Looking to the north at about a 60 degree angle was a large round amber light in the clear sky. It was much, much larger than a star. It did not appear to move. It was at a pretty high altitude and look fairly far away. I was altered to the light from others in the audience who where pointing at it as well. There is an airport in the area, but it was certainly not a plain. The amber light in the sky was much bigger than standard aircraft lights or landing lights. I didn't see the object fly away. I remember looking at it twice about 15 seconds apart. Then a third look a few minutes later and it was gone. Not sure if it was in Nebraska or Iowa. Really right along the Missouri River."],"Log Number":"US-08262009-0014","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.264694,+-95.853503(18895)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18895) map </A>","City":"Council Bluffs","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18895.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18895.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/22/2009 09:28 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Case Number":"18895","Disposition":"IFO"}
