(i am used to watching planes at night so i wasn't expecting to see what i saw, i expected nothing more then just another plane.) but when it came out from behind the trees i thought to myself, \"is that a triangle?\". so i looked at it more carefully. that is when i noticed that there were four white lights on it. i could only see the bottom and there was a light on each corner and one in the very center. only the center light flased (pulsed) on & off. at this point i was kinda thrown off because i didn't recall ever seeing a plane with lights that don't blink on the wings and i started freaking out a little (in my mind). i told myself to calm down and look at it again before it moved over the car and out of my line of sight. and this time i told myself to look for the wings (thinking that would be the end of it) but that is when i realized that i couldn't see the outline\\shape of wings and that the shape really was a triangle because i could clearly see the shape of the craft because of the light colored clouds in the sky that night (it was a really cloudy night and the clouds were kinda lit up from the city lights if you understand what i mean.) it was flying under the clouds deck and i could clearly see that it was black and to my utter amasement it was shaped like a triangle. there were no wings, only a perfect triangle. the strangest part is that right as i noticed that it was actually a triangle i noticed that is wasn't flying straight but rather from right to left going over the highway. i have never seen anything fly like that except for helicopters and helicopters never look like that object did (day or night). the craft moved over the car and i couldn't see it anymore because we were still moving down the highway going away from it. when i tried to look back and see it again i could only see light, not shape or anything else. i continued to watch the sky to see if i could see a plane or anything flying under the clouds like that craft was and i didn't see anything for hours after my sighting. and not only that, there wasn't anymore lightning for at least two hours or so after we got home. my boyfriend was driving the car at the time and i was so freaked out at what i'd seen that i didn't mention it to him. along with the fact that i thought he would make fun of my for thinking that i saw something considering how much i am into ufo's and aliens. i did build up the courage to tell him later that night but when i told him he said that he didn't believe me because i didn't tell him as soon as i saw it. i really saw something that night. i wish i'd told him to look so i wouldn't be alone on this but like they say \"hind sight is 20\\20\". now i am alone with my thoughts and questions. and the worst part is who knows if i will ever see something like that again. flying low and clearly visible. wow, i finally saw one! weird weird weird"],"Weather Factors":"Lightning, Rain, Light","Latitude":"33.815321","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.815321,+-84.160836(16789)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16789) map </A>","Longitude":"-84.160836","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16789.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16789.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/01/2009 10:53 UTC","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/01/2009 10:53 UTC","Summary":"Triangle shaped craft w/ white lights underneath and the center light flashing on and off.","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Stone Mountain","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Region":"Georgia","Case Number":"16789","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05042009-0005"}
