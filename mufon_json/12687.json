My mother called me outside and pointed out the object. Our whole family including grandma saw it. It was larger than a plane since a plane was in the sky at the time, object was around the same altitude as the cloud layer. Was square in shape and was flashing all different colors, and changing shape! It looked kind of like a rubics cube twisting. If light came out of all the squares on a rubics cube that was twisting in the sky thats what we saw. I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I am pretty well self educated about aircraft. It moved away from our area until it looked like a star against the sky. Someone put a spot light up near the object so I know that lots of people probably saw this thing. My whole family saw it, and it was scary. PLEASE email me and let me know if there were other reports of this event. THANKS- Greg. PS im not a ufo enthusiast, before tonight i thought it was all BS."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.435843","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12687.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12687.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/20/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"San Clemente","Longitude":"-117.608132","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/20/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"12687","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Log Number":"US-09212008-0004","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in San Clemente","There were no other sightings in San Clemente on or around September 20th 2008"]}
