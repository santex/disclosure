This happened 2x. Ironically, I did some research and people from other parts of NJ reported the same type of event. My event happened in South Jersey, 18 miles East of Philadelphia in Marlton, NJ. It was also sleeting outside, but no way was it lightning. I got up and stood at the window and looked for whatever it was. I couldn't see anything, because it was above the clouds. Whatever it was, it illuminated the clouds and lit of the entire area. Thanks!
