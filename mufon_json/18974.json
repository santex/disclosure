{"divs":["sighting detailsthis is a true story, that became stranger when i learned of some things my father had been involved with. in 1995, my little brother and i were recounting our life as kids over a beer at college. he mentioned my fasination with spiderman as a kid, specifically when we lived in oh. i instantly recalled a strange thing that happened to me. i got excited and my little brother confirmed he remembered my story. i made him recount the story that i knew so well, but wanted to see if he recalled the reason why i was so in to \"spiderman\". i don't think i told anyone else of this story and i know he had not heard this story since he was 6 to 7 years old. winter\\fall evening of 1978; dayton, oh; sugar creek area. my father a well respected naval intelligence insider and test pilot was working at the time on secret aviation things at a nearby afb, he has admitted only that he worked on things that required \"reverse engineering\". he is a technology and intelligence community insider. i am in the military currently, so names are not an option today. what happened was: i was playing on the floor near a second story window, i was 6yrs old. my little brother was in a half body cast from a broken leg. i noticed a small grey \"balloon\" hovering outside the window. everytime i looked at this shape, it went down below the window sill out of my sight. finally, i asked my little brother \"do you see that balloon?\". as i got him turned around to look, (he was not mobile, i had to shift him) \"it\" was gone. then, something went vertical past the window in a blurr. as i watched and stared, i got very scared, this \"balloon\", peaked in from over the window. it had eyes. it quickly retreated back upwards and i didn't see it again. i ran to the window yelling \"spiderman, spiderman!\" all i saw outside was the large oak-tree branch just outide the window. i recall it was getting dark\\dusk. i am writing this story becasuse all of us should think about the unexpalined in our lives and try to make sense of it. my neighbor years later told me that they had seen lights in the corn field that was in my backyard that year. i believe i had seen something watching me, something in the tree, and it was not an owl, and it was not spiderman. i also believe that my father knows something about the ufo phenomenon because since 1995 i have been able to get him to talk about things, and he has reluctantly told me that he did meet the men in black during the time of my story. someday i will find out why he \"can't answer\" my questions...i'll be sure to share what i learn."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18974.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18974.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.768568,+-84.187407(18974)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18974) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/01/1978 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-84.187407","Summary":"Years ago I saw something in a tree outside my window","Latitude":"39.768568","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Dayton","Case Number":"18974","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"US-08312009-0003","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dayton","There were no other sightings in Dayton on or around October 1st 1978"],"Date Submitted":"08/31/2009 03:57 UTC"}
