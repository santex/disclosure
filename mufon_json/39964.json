There were trees in the skyline but more kept entering our line of vision over the road, over 2 dozen softly pulsating lights coming from the west. We pulled over .25 miles up the road and I got out of the car. I tried to count the lights, there were maybe 27-30 of them but they were fading as they headed east. It was hard for me to tell how low they were but I could not make out any distinct characteristics of the objects except that they looked like low moving stars traveling in a clustered line, no sound at all. I took a quick video on my phone but the image quality is poor and most had already passed."],"Tags":"City","City":"Troy"}
