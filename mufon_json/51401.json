I stopped and took a picture. I arrived home within 4 minutes and could not locate the falling object. However, within minutes of arriving home, my daughter, and my mother and I observed an object no more than 500 ft above us,fly over my home. It was round in shape, and cast a very shiny light off of itself. It was flying south straight towards the sun. It appeared to have a spherical cloud around itself,but also something quite odd. It appeared to have a fin, much like a fish tail that created or propelled its movement forward. It seemed to glide effortlessly through the sky with no noise. I snapped pics of both. There should be a time stamp, as both were taken from my camera phone. The metor was quite large to see in person and these pics don't do it total justice."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
