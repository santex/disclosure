Grabbed a fudgesicle & went out to the balcony. Ate some. Looked up & saw bright light above me. Pulsated a few times & slowly rose out of sight. Bright whitish purple light. It happened within minutes. Or seconds. After it left? Guess? I was in shock then i started weeping. I became very thankful & got the hello i've wanted. Before I went outside I was listening to channeled messages from the Galactic Federation of Light. The message really hit home. I needed to walk away from my computer. So i went outside."],"Date Submitted":"05/16/2012 04:17 UTC","Summary":"i was guided outside looked up above me & saw light flash a few times - then flew str8up","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.644692,+-112.142425(38178)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38178) map </A>","Case Number":"38178","Source":"MUFON"}
