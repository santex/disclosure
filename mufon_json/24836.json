When I got home and looked over the pictures, I spotted this strange object. I thought it was just another seaplane, but upon closer inspection, it appeared different in shape. I didn't notice it while taking the picture since I was concentrating on catching the plane I wanted to photograph, and I didn't hear it, or dismissed it as there were other seaplanes making noise in the background.
