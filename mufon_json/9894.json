After many years, I���ve decided to officially go on record with my story. In 1998, I was 25 years old and working as a production coordinator for a video production company out of New Orleans, LA. A couple of times a year, I would travel to Louisville, KY to work at conventions and I would drive the company equipment truck, a 15 foot Penske cube-type rental truck. I had just finished up a week long convention in Louisville and was in the truck, headed home to New Orleans, late one spring night. It was around midnight as I drove alone. I was traveling south on Interstate 65 and had made it a couple of hours south of Louisville which, I would say put me around Bowling Green, KY. In that area, nothing but wide open, rolling cow pastures were on either side, as far as could be seen. I had the window cracked to catch the breeze while I drove. The radio was off. All was very quiet, just the sound of the wind. I was cruising at about 65 mph in the slow lane as I drove a pretty boring and straight stretch of road. Then, what I see next out of my peripheral vision is another vehicle coming up to pass me in the left lane. As it breaks ahead and then eases over into my lane, just 2 car lengths in front of my truck, I realize that this was not just another car. It was a craft that was hovering about 4 feet off the ground, at level with my windshield and had assumed a fixed cruising speed with me. I sank back in my chair, jaw hanging to the floor in utter shock at what I was seeing. It was the shape of the typically reported, hat shaped saucer, about the size of a compact car. It was like a yellowish tan color, smooth all over (no visible windows, lights, doors, bolts, handles, creases, etc. that would make it seem man-made) It had a noodily looking thing that reminded me of a parascope, probably about the width and length of an arm, sticking out the top of this craft. I would call this craft slightly metallic, as my headlights gleamed off of it like a finely waxed show car would. But, I would not say that it was glowing or emitting any of its own light. It hovered there in front of me, in that fixed position, for only about 8 seconds. But, believe me, it was plenty of time to get a good look at it. It then proceeded to gradually and smoothly accelerate away from me. In another 10 seconds, I lost sight of it over the next hill. There was only one other car on the highway that I could see, way up ahead of it as it moved away. I���ve always wondered if that other driver got buzzed as well. Needless to say, my adrenaline was through the roof. I then proceeded all the way back to Louisiana, an 11 hour trip that was started at 10PM at night after a full day of work, without stopping. Normally, I would check in to a hotel at the halfway mark on those trips but, not that night!"],"City":"Bowling Green","Longitude":"-86.438602","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9894.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9894.html"],"Case Number":"9894","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Buzzed by a UFO on the Interstate - Bowling Green, KY"}
