One is larger than the rest.(there are smaller lights that travel with it). Very bright like a star. It seems like it's cloaked and when it appears that's when it moves. Each time I've seen this it has been at different altitudes. for two weeks they were traveling south to southwest now they are traveling north to northwest. They do not pulsate or blink just a steady very bright glow.-It is the end of July and I am still watching these lights but at much higher altitude. I watch these travel higher up to a point where I cannot see them any longer. There is no sound."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Latitude":"48.817757","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.817757,+-100.051138(49346)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49346) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"North Dakota","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/31/2013 04:21 UTC","Log Number":"US-07312013-0020","Date of the Event":"06/01/2013 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None"}
