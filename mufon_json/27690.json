If it were dark I would say it looked like Saturn. It was still very much daylight so I started to fell like it was not something normal. It was as high as a commercial jet or higher. It traveled exactly south to north. It did not change altitude that I could notice. From my location I would estimate it was flying between I 95 and the ocean approximately 15 degrees off of straight up. It traveled north for at least 5-10 minutes before I lost it in a cloud and was never able to reacquire. It was witnessed by my self and my wife. It did not leave contrails. It had no flashing lights. There was no sound. My first real thought was maybe the ISS or some other Satellite or the space shuttle.
