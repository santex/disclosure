One sun, the real sun was bigger, but there was a smaller one just as bright off to the left. It was the weirdest thing ever. I did get three pics of them. I expected to hear something about it on the news, but never did. Clearly other people had to see it, were driving down a highway. This is the first time I am talking about it."],"Longitude":"-85.784453","Latitude":"42.209484","Region":"Michigan","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","City":"Mattawan","Summary":"Looked like there was two suns in the sky","Case Number":"40104","Log Number":"US-07032012-0011","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/03/2011 06:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40104.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/40104_submitter_file1__TwoSunsSky2email.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40104.html"],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"07/03/2012 12:32 UTC"}
