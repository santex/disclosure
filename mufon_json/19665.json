It was an object that I thought was an airplane because it looked like it had a strobe light but I kept looking at it and the object was not moving. I told my wife and my kids to look at the object. My wife does not like to think about things like that because it freaks her out. So my daughter was looking at the object and we were there for about 30 minutes or so. The object kept changing colors, a red color, blue color then a white color. I took a photo but ny camera could not zoom that much, but I did my best. The object then started moving toward the west northwest slowly till I could barely see the lights. It was kind of freaky being from south Texas you dont see this kind of things."],"Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/26/2009 09:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"09/26/2009 11:20 UTC"}
