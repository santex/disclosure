{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details I was giving my dogs their nightly walk. I like to look up into the sky, since Florida's sky is beautiful and clear and many stars are present. I saw shooting stars in the past month and hoping to see another while looking into the sky on a very clear night around 9:30 pm, a green orb went into the sky and vanished.While watching the orb, I thought \"how pretty\" and waited to hear a noise as I thought it was a firework. It made no sound, and the orbs colors didn't run or fade or trail as a firework would have. No one was around.The sky was completly silent. The orb kept its size and shape. It went up then curved forward and disappeared. I know it wasn't a firework and I have no other answer to as what it could be. The orb moved faster as it curved, before it disappeared. Almost like \"Up, Up and Away\"..basiclly it levatated up, then forward."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Fort Myers","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-81.863278","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.645828,+-81.863278(8555)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8555) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12052007-0003","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","Case Number":"8555","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/04/2007 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"26.645828","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"green orb that went up into sky at a curve and dissapeared","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8555.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8555.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/04/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Fort Myers","There were no other sightings in Fort Myers on or around December 4th 2007"]}
