As I watched, this object zoomed rapidly toward the ground. As it got closer the more colorful it bacame. It looked like it was on fire but had more colors than a the usual red and yellow. The colors I remember seeing were yellow, red, green, blue, white. As a matter of fact I think all colors of the rainbow were represented! Anyway, this fireball was going really fast. It came straight down and looked like it was going to hit my neighbor's roof directly across the driveway from my house when at the last second (about 5-10 feet from the roof) it did a 180 reverse course and shot back up into the sky and disappeared from view. One of the neighbors was outside and saw the same thing. After it happened I said \"Wow!\" loudly. The neighbor heard me and said \"whay was that?\" I said in a matter of fact way, \"a ufo.\""],"Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27355.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27355.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-75.155389","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around August 15th 1973"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01112011-0008","Date of the Event":"08/15/1973 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.955695"}
