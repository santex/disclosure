There were no lights, no reflected lights from the ground. The only way that my son and I saw it was that it blocked out the stars as it moved overhead. There was a faint outline of a black object against a deep blue of the sky and the stars. The object appeared to be at a low altitude, but it would have been hard to determine for sure. It was completely silent, no noise at all. The object seemed to travel quicker than a normal airplane or helocopter. It was like a shadow, with an absence of stars and sky. My son, 14, saw it, and followed it across the sky, and pointed it out to me. There will be another report filed for a different date and time, although it was the same description. The direction of travel was different, too."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"Dark triangle shape across the sky, blocking out the stars","Longitude":"-100.798798","City":"Perryton","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"43528","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Perryton","There were no other sightings in Perryton on or around August 11th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43528.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43528.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"08/11/2012 01:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.395292,+-100.798798(43528)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43528) map </A>"}
