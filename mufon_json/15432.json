My account: I was in my car and I see a light at night. I look and it goes over the car. I got a good look at it before it was gone light and all. I told you what it looked like above 2 oval-like shapes connected by a bar and had a bunch of lights. Then when it went past the roof it was gone. Now Im about to tell you something that has been deleted from a website not by the makers. On a UFO hunters episode about the landed UFO with a symbol. It was A circle with A triangele inside it, At the bottom left of the inside of the triangle is a dot and at the Top left of the circle is another dot. Put that up to a map of the North america and the circle is covering the rockies the dots are at MT. Mckinley and Mt. Whitney! This is where reptoid aliens are spotted in America but not limited to them.
