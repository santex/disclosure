Sure enough first I've noticed a large cotton ball like light sphere higher a bit than the sun & to the right of it . I've set my grocery bags on the ground & took out my camera . When I've aimed it at this sphere for a brief second I thought I seen it as metallic ship , so I lifted the camera & looking at the screen I took the photo . (this ship was visible on the screen , yet when I looked at it in the sky it looked as a much dimmer light now, obviously I thought my eyes maybe played tricks since I was looking at the sky & afterwards I had a huge dark blob in font of my eyes for few minutes). I really thought something would show up once put on iphoto but to my amazement there was absolutely nothing in that specific area , which suprised me a great deal , since even light orb ships photograph beautifully ! The only way this could have happened (I think) that at the moment I pressed the button the UFO was in the process of changing its appearance again . The ufo was as the person's photo # 2 in the report ID # 24242 :-) However , when i zoomed in on the computer trying to see if the ufo is hiding in the illuminated clouds somewhere in the photo , it sure was there , a large white ball . Than I brought that segment even closer & adjusted sharpness , contrast , etc , & there it popped out several small orbs in addition to that large one ! I was elated at seeing it . I'm attaching the original photograph & the zoomed in modified copy of what I just described so your investigators can have a go at it . The photo was taken at exactly 6:43:33 PM . ( before I took this image I watched it for approximately 3 minutes or so ). Once at home later I took another photo through the window this time but nothing really showed up on the computer except 3 high up in the W & another solitary one on the way to N direction ."],"Case Number":"24259","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"43.659656","Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 01:24 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-07062010-0010"}
