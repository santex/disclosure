{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI sat along the Columbia river, and saw a large oval shaped silent UFO traveling East. It was metallic colored, and shifted (as it traveled East) into a pyramid shape with smooth edges. It then shifted into a flat oval, getting closer to the water, then went out of my limited sight up stream. I first thought it might be a balloon, because there wasn't any noise, but there also wasn't any wind. Normally the wind travels West bound, against the direction this traveled. It was about the size of 2 buses. Unfortunately I did not have a camera. An important aspect of this sight was I asked what I could do with improving my job. A very strong thought occurred to me, what if, right now, all you needed to do was be Love? Instantly, I rejoiced with being Love first. Every time I hear of UFO's, an appropriate welcome is being Love not fear."],"Summary":"Silently foating aprox. 50 yards above the river, a UFO traveled East.","Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13226.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13226.html"],"Longitude":"-122.652606","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.648158,+-122.652606(13226)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13226) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","City":"Vancouver","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/30/2008 03:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"13226","Log Number":"US-10252008-0010","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Vancouver","There were no other sightings in Vancouver on or around September 30th 2008"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/30/2008 03:15 UTC","Latitude":"45.648158","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Oval, Other","Tags":"City"}
