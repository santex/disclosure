{"Region":"Tennessee","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsWitness awoke late in the night and saw a light shining through his bedroom window. He looked outside and saw a golden shimmering oval glowing object hovering over a hill several hundred yards away. It was illuminating trees, grass, and houses outside his window. He watched for several minutes and the object remained unchanged. He remembers not being surprised or alarmed at the time but just went back to bed. It was only twenty minutes later, in bed, that he realized anything unusual had occurred. He went to the window again, but the oval had left."],"Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4742.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4742.html"],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Kingsport","There were no other sightings in Kingsport on or around February 10th 2006"],"City":"Kingsport","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05042006-0001","Latitude":"36.549574","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.549574,+-82.559369(4742)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4742) map </A>","Longitude":"-82.559369","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/10/2006 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Witness briefly saw oval light outside his window","Case Number":"4742","Date Submitted":"02/10/2006 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
