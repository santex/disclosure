What made me notice it was when I was looking up at the stars in the sky. At first I thought it was a passenger airplane. Then I noticed that the blinking object was moving side to side in a zig zag motion like a mexican jumping bean. Then before object disappeared into the atmospher it ejected something that looked similar to a shooting star. I didnt see the object again right that. At first I thought it was a passenger airplane in trouble and my reaction was to keep watch to see what would happen next. My reaction after the disappearance of the object I was told to contact Mufon and tell my story. I lost sight because the object never reappeared anywhere in the sky."],"Case Number":"43009"}
