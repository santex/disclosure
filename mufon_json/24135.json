It looked like a cluster of red and yellow stars but appeared to be one object with many parts in the general shape of a ball. I am an amature astronomer so I know it was not a star and it was not any type of commercial fireworks as we have none in our town. Too high to be any homemade fireworks. It just moved slowly and up and down for four or five minutes then was gone."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.276366,+-82.713965(24135)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24135) map </A>","Summary":"Slow moving object.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24135.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24135.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07042010-0018","Country":"United States","Latitude":"28.276366","Date Submitted":"07/04/2010 09:34 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 09:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"24135","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Longitude":"-82.713965"}
