I use to train at daytime by following airplanes. This day I had the airplane in sight and followed it with an 25��� ocular. Near the right wing I spotted an object looking like a white half transperant plastic bag almost sphere like or like a jellyfish but I can not recall the exact shape. After a view seconds or a minute (plain was already gone) a second object (same look) aproached from the right side, it apears to be smaller and was faster and it somehow flew around the first object like it interacts with the other. I called my girlfrind to look into the teleskope so she can see it aswell she confirmes the objects to be strange. I was not visible without the teleskope and so I had no way taking pictures. As the objects where unspectaculare and due to the fact it is taff to look through the teleskope for a long time (bend down) I lost interest. After investigating online much later I found the objects to be matching the pictures a nasa astronaut took in the orbit. I'm sorry for my english (I'm german) personly I think all evidance availbe is much too bad to be \"proove\" as my sighting many others are just too bad to proove anything and everyone loughs about ufos and so I dont' tell my litte story to anyone I know.
