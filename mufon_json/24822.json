Out of the south I noticed a bright red flashing light and behind it was a very bright group of white lights (assumed to be a jet). They traversed the sky from south to north at about 35 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate that they covered about 20 miles in the minute or so of observation. The distance between the two objects remained the same as it travelled. As it passed directly in front of my vantage point I could hear a faint jet sound approximately 1000 feet behind the bright white light. While I did not see any material body between the two lights, I got the feeling that it was just one single object. I'm assuming that this was some type of military craft."],"Tags":"City","Region":"Idaho","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.073642,+-114.732431(24822)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24822) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24822.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24822.html"],"Summary":"A bright red flashing light led what appeared to be a jet across the sky.","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
