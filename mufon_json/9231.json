{"Date Submitted":"01/01/2008 12:16 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI began investigating these after my son had witnessed a strange orange glowing ballon outside his window about Mid Dec 2007, my wife and I assumed he had only seen a plane or such. ON Jan 1 2008 around 1215 am I saw saw a glowing orange ballon shaped obhect that seemed to float over the trees near our house. It was bright enough that it caught our eyes thru the windows. We were in differnt rooms and differnt floors but both saw it and ran out to try to see what it was. It really looked like a miniature hotair ballon with a orange glow or fire color. Object would rise and lower and moved very slowly. It was not far away 200' or so but made absolutely no noise. No strong winds or inclement weather, object was clearly visible and easy to see. Object just seemed to disappear as I was watching it. I would like to say that this object has been reported locally several times in the last few months. I did not know this or that this web site existed until we later starting researching sightings in Massillon."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9231.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9231.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/01/2008 12:16 UTC","Case Number":"9231","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.796724,+-81.521509(9231)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9231) map </A>","Log Number":"US-01252008-0001","City":"Massillon","Latitude":"40.796724","Longitude":"-81.521509","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"round orange ballon shape","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Region":"Ohio","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Massillon","There were no other sightings in Massillon on or around January 1st 2008"]}
