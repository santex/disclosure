I saw what I thought were stars given that they were far off and not particularly bright. Then, I detected that there were four of these \"stars\" in a diamond formation all moving in the same direction at the same speed. I watched them for about 10 minutes to determine if they could be random high altitude aircraft or perhaps satellites in orbit. What was strange to me was that they always were moving in unison at the same speed and in the same direction. My thought was that they were either flying very high and in tremendously good formation at a very large distance apart or perhaps it was lights on what would have to have been a very huge craft of some sort. After awhile, though still visible and moving away to the northwest, I stopped watching them and went back to watching the movie at the ampitheater."],"City":"Pompano Beach","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
