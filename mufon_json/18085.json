It had a red tail almost as long as it was. It moved from left to right horizontally. I had time to say to myself that it was definitely NOT a plane. It was larger by far, and brighter and had no wings. There was NO sound. I watched for about another 15 minutes but nothing furher happened. It was not moving fast enough for a comet or meteor or shooting star, but moved faster than an airplane. I am wondering if there were any other sightings in Londonderry, NH that night."],"Longitude":"-71.371407","Case Number":"18085","Summary":"Very bright White object with a tail of red (like fire) moving silently over the tree tops in my backyard.
