I was given some photos of a delivery truck that was going to get a facelift as far as the graphics go. So as I was getting familiar with the selection of images, I decided that the shot taken of the side would be useful to get the right proportion for the design. As I zoomed in to look at the truck surface I noticed a light or highlight in the sky above the truck even with the back edge about 2\" inches above. It does have a metallic sphere shape with a good highlight and shadow area. I thought it was interesting."],"Date of the Event":"05/28/2009 10:21 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.267841,+-88.405885(24085)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24085) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07022010-0007","Tags":"City","Case Number":"24085","Object Shape":"Sphere, Teardrop","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/02/2010 11:33 UTC"}
