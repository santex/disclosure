I turned to look towards the east and I saw a very large object in the middle of the sky. I pointed it out to my mom. It was a copper color. I know it sounds strange but it looked like Someone had cut out a giant piece of metal and taped it up in the sky. It didn't move and wasn't attached to anything. It jus floated there for as long as we could see it. It was shaped like a rectangle but slanted on one side. No noise. I dont know how else to explain it. It was so strange!"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-105.774067","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/28/2013 01:32 UTC"}
