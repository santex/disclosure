I expected maybe it was a plane that had been flagged or something, but then the helicopter flew to the south where I figured it landed at LAX and the object went off to the east toward the San Bernardino mts. I'm telling you it was an extremely strange accurance. Oh and by the way, while this was happening, all of a sudden all these sirens started to go off, police and anbulance so of cource my mind went to they've gone emergency mode. I called the airport police, so I'll probably get a visit, but I wanted you to hear my story. wowwwww!!!"],"City":"Los Angeles","Latitude":"33.985967","Log Number":"US-12272012-0010","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44816.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44816.html"],"Case Number":"44816","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.985967,+-118.424801(44816)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44816) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/27/2012 06:20 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/27/2012 10:03 UTC","Summary":"2 or 3 helicopters, 1 which was head to head for over 10 minutes then took of to the direction of Lax then the lights took off to the east","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"00:18:10","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
