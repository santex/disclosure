Noticed an object never seen before, floating silently about 100-150 ft above the ground, moving away from us diagaonaly. It was shaped like a 150 ml wine bottle (cylindrical, pinched toward the rear, color similar to titanium, with white, opaque, elliptical projections in a precise geometric diamond pattern on the main body of the object. It was moving slowly, possibly only 40-50 mph, away from us on a straight path toward the NE. Precisely one week later, under almost identical conditions, she and I exzperienced a virtually identical viewing. The only difference was a minor change in direction of path. About one month later, while working on the construction of our house about 20 miles west, I saw the same object about 10 miles west of me. I am an architect, my daughter has performed well on national academic tests. We are troubled by our experiences. There are others we need to share. When I lived in Ft. Myers, FL, I witnessed my first UFO sighting. I can't document the date, but about 1:30 am one night about 1990, I witnessed three fuzzy, glowing balls of orange light, at about 500 ft elevation, in triangular formation, travelling north, roughly following the centerline of the Caloosahatchee River two blocks away from us, toward the north at most at 100 mph. When they reached the approximate location of the main bridge, they made an abrupt 45 degree change of path toward the nw. As they made that change, I could see between them, proving that they were not connected and that they had made a change of direction that no known man-made aircraft could have accomplished."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Other","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Blairsville","There were no other sightings in Blairsville on or around September 24th 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/03/2012 09:34 UTC","Latitude":"34.880209","Region":"Georgia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.880209,+-83.949571(41396)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41396) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41396.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41396.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41396.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/24/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
