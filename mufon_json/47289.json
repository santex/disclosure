{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMay 8, 2013. 10:30 pm approx. Felt the need to go outside last night. I was standing in my driveway smoking a cigarette looking up at the stars. I was relaxed and wondering \"how do I know these are stars or planets?\" I dont know why I thought that. As I was standing there, looking at the stars in the NE sky, one of the stars I was looking at just faded to nothing. I laughed to myself, thinking \"well I guess they are not All stars or planets out there\". Again, it did not move, blink, change color or anything, it looked just like every other star in the sky. So I continued to watch for a.few more minutes. I noticed at that point a plane flying North from the south east. (I knew it was a plane because of the blinking lights). It flew exactly to the same area the disappearing star had been. It was not going fast, it may have been just a commercial plane, no jet noise or anything, but i thought it was noteworthy. The whole event lasted less than 10 min."],"Log Number":"US-05092013-0007","Longitude":"-106.761114","City":"Las Cruces","Region":"New Mexico","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.32528","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.32528,+-106.761114(47289)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47289) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47289.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47289.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"47289","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/08/2013 10:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Date Submitted":"05/09/2013 02:00 UTC","Summary":"Star (?) in NE sky Nm, watched it for a min., then it just faded away. did not move ever.","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Las Cruces","There were no other sightings in Las Cruces on or around May 8th 2013"]}
