We had witness on several occasions something hovering above the mountains across from us. On this occasion we where sitting in the living room everything was turned off, kids in bed. We had a larger window and we're sitting beside it talking. I saw something out of the corner of my eye turned my head and saw something greenish falling from the sky. I told my husband to look, we saw this green shape fall into the mountains. I can only describe it like a shooting star crashing to earth. I wondered after if we should call someone, I wanted to know if anyone else had seen it. It seemed important, I wanted to go look for it but looking the next morning it could have landed anywhere."],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
