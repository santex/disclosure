When I went out he pointed to a star like object that was moving slightly to the right and then to the left and slowly up higher. He ask if he was seeing things or was it actually hovering and moving from side to side. I confirmed this as I was witnessing the same thing. It was located North east. We watched for a few minutes and he went in the house. A couple minutes later another one of these star like objects appeared south east. I watched as it did the same thing as the first. My son came back out and observed both of these objects with me. We looked through night vision binoculars and saw the movement and the colors were red, blue and green. As we were watching airplanes started coming in the direction of the objects and probably in a 15-20 minute period there were over 15 planes in the same path. Seemed strange for planes to be coming in that path and so many as if they were checking them out also."],"Date of the Event":"10/28/2009 07:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10292009-0008","Date Submitted":"10/29/2009 04:02 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20183.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20183.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Two star like ufo","Case Number":"20183","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"39.047905"}
