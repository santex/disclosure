{"divs":["sighting detailsi was just laying back on my bed to my surprise moon is out so i kept looking for a moment longer then i would have when a shiny green diamond like object cruises across my field of view maybe a 1\\4 mile? (about full city block) away about 200 ft up? i snapped up at fast first and looked laughed thought it was runaway balloon. but kept watching carefully to see actually it was like an 8 sided emerald and very flat edge metallic shiny reflective green. had white prtusion that was perfectly straight down and far thicker then a string. that's what gave me the clue it was so easy to see a string that far away? why if it was perfectly horizontally across my field of view at maybe 50 miles an hour, while rotating, then was the string not flapping or moving how come i see it? watched it until i couldn't see any longer. flight path and consistent speed of rotation made me believe something very odd. still could be talked into believing it's a strange balloon."],"Log Number":"US-04132008-0012","Longitude":"-118.449907","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"10307","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/14/2008 04:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.154592,+-118.449907(10307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10307) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10307.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10307.html"],"trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were 2 other sightings in Los Angeles on or around April 14th 2008"],"Date of the Event":"04/14/2008 04:30 UTC","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","City":"Los Angeles","Latitude":"34.154592","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Diamond","Summary":"Green Emerald Metallic maybe eight sided? diamond white protrusion on bottom"}
