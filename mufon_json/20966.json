{"Summary":"Two powerfully bright lights fixed opposite one another w/ transparent cylindar like object between them","Case Number":"20966","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsTravelling North bound on HWY 360 in Arlington, TX. Passing General Motors, I looked up in the North sky, just North of the Six Flags Mall and there were two powerfully bright lights in the dark sky [10:38pm]. The lights were opposite of each other & the craft was stationary stationary initially, then it began to elevate moderately. The closer it got to the clouds, the gray over cast became lighted and visible like lingering smoke --in the once dark sky. Suddenly the crafts speed of ascention was rapidly increased and the object shot up into the clouds. The clouds bore a cylinder clearance where the object had just vanished into-- and shortly there after the clouds disapated from the cylinder clearance form...as if it never happened."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around December 11th 2009"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Latitude":"32.741317","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/12/2009 12:56 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20966.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20966.html"],"Longitude":"-97.104136","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/11/2009 10:38 UTC","City":"Arlington","Log Number":"US-12122009-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.741317,+-97.104136(20966)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20966) map </A>"}
