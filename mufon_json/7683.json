The witness looked up and saw 4-7 bright objects hanging in the sky behind the jet spaced apart from each other. They appeared to be circular discs, white in color as if silver metallic reflecting the sun, a little larger than the size of a pea held at arms length. They were perfectly still in the sky. The witness thought this was strange and ran into the house to get his camera. When he returned 30 seconds later the objects were gone."],"trends":["There have been 49 other sightings in Huntington Beach","There were no other sightings in Huntington Beach on or around August 11th 2007"],"Summary":"4 to 7 lights disc shaped the size of a pea at arms length hanging in the sky","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/11/2007 07:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08152007-0006"}
