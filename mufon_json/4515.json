I was looking at the clear night sky when a bright light caught my eye to the NW. It appeared to look as bright as Venus. I thought it was Venus, but it started to come at me slowly. I told my dad to look at the object and when i did it changed shape (a lime-green line i think) and went in a whole different direction as fast as a satellite in the sky. This light still starts in that position on some nights and comes after me i think still. But it never changed shape like that. It was very weird. I was puzzled and i finally went inside the house."],"Longitude":"-87.450953","Latitude":"40.953656","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4515.html"],"Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.953656,+-87.450953(4515)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4515) map </A>","Case Number":"4515","Source":"MUFON"}
