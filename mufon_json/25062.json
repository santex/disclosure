{"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Series of several round bright lights in the eastern sky.","Region":"Georgia","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy adult daughter and I were driving home from a county commisioners meeting and noticed several round shaped bright white lights in the sky. A central bright light stayed fairly in place while three or four other seemed to be circling the one in the center. We did not think these lights were anything we could put a description on. This lasted about an hour or so, then someone said it may be planes from Moody Air Force base. They said that the ones circling were just refueling the one in the middle. I didnt buy this, but you can only watch so long, we got uninterested and went inside and went to bed. Two days later there was a report on the internet news about a UFO sighting in Texas that sounded very much like what my daughter and I saw earlier in our place in Georgia"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.716534,+-73.166299(25062)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25062) map </A>","Latitude":"44.716534","Date Submitted":"08/11/2010 11:11 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Georgia","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25062.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25062.html"],"City":"Georgia","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-73.166299","Date of the Event":"04/30/2007 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"25062","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Log Number":"US-08112010-0003","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle"}
