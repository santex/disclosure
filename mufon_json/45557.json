'it's a triangle!!!' we were looking at the bottom of whatever it was (or top), and in the last 5-8 seconds of visibility, i saw a small (much smaller) red light in the exact middle. again, no outline visible. it was about ten to twenty blocks away at this point (the distance is hard to judge), and slowly drifting east. i guess it was the size of half a city block- my husband, who was trying to keep us on the road this whole time, saw the change from a line into a triangle and we both lost it over the buildings of the east side. he thinks it was 100 feet or more per side. it was now about the elevation of a 5 or ten story building. about 2-4 seconds later, we turned left, west on to 6th st, and that was the end of the sighting. in conclusion, there is a lot of light pollution in the middle of the city, but this was perfectly clear the whole time. it was never static, always changing in same slow way in direction, intensity, size and shape. i cannot believe what i just wrote, but it is so true!!! i hope i am articulate enough that what we saw is coming across clearly. many people would have been able to see this (it was a busy night), but so many of us barely look up, especially at night. i have found it hard to think of much else. i am still amazed, and feel happy and interested in what we saw, and i don't for once thing that it was made by, or navigated by, earth people. glad you have such a great forum to report something like this. i have read ufo cases almost daily the past year, but have never read of a sighting that resembled this. all the best to each of you."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"30.272593","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Austin","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.272593,+-97.733661(45557)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45557) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"line of small blue lights- coming directly towards us- became triangle with big white lights on corners and small red light in middle- above I-35..."}
