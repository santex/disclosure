{"divs":["sighting detailsi had observed 3-4 previous sightings in the company of another friend in different location (but all were within 40 miles of one another), my friend and myself regularily went out at night and did ufo watches to see what we could see. having had previous expierience\\luck with our watches we were fairly sure of our abitily in distinguishing the differance between stars, planes, helicopters, etc. this particular evening we were in the company of a third person whom was a very spiritual person whom had been interested in native spiritualality and shamanism, we had a small fire in my friends backyard, mostly for warmth as the light of the fire was considered *light pollution*i noticed a reddish orange light which very closely resembled mars. we were facing north west, and i made a mental note that it did not \"look right\". it was just a little too big to be mars as well as being in the wrong part of the sky. the light was stationary, made no noise and did not fluctate in brightness or color intensity. we all continued to look around and every once and a while i would look back at the light \"keeping tabs on it\" about one half hour after firstnoticing it, the light flashed a lot brighter than it had been. the color did not change just the intensity of the light. it was very quick like a camera flash. imediately the light began to drop slowly from the sky in a zig zag pattern, like a lightning bolt first down then right, then down then left, then down,,,,etc. right away i said to myself in a very strong thought ( ah ha i knew it i have got you) my friend has a mititary surplus night vision telescope and as soon as i saw it moving i ran to get it from inside his house. i was gone for no more than about 1 minute and when i was coming out of the house i could hear a jet, a low pitched roar...not like a passenger jet, they have a high pitched wine...as i came down the front stairs i looked in the direction in which saw the light and noticed that it was gone, about 3 seconds later a small jet came into view. it is kind of hard to explain exactly how it approached ...we were one quarter mile above the earls cove ferry terminal on the sunshine coast facing north west. the light was in the sky obviously, it was hard to determine the exact distance\\elavation in which it was. (as i said it appeared to resemble mars or a star, i suppose at (star distance) ). when i went for the telascope i later learned that it had dropped down in front of nelson island and disapeared into a valley\\draw on the south\\ south eastern face of the island\\mountain, which in turn (knowing the area quite well) told me the light was only about one quarter to one half mile away at an elavation of maybe 1 to 2 thousand feet. the approaching jet came up from behind the island as though it had been traveling at about 1 to 2 hundres feet in elavation. i flew in from the north west, my impression was that it was using the island to as cover as it snuck up from behind the light. as the jet came up and over the island the light was gone and the aircraft banked left and then right very quickly as if the pilot was trying to look directly below himself. it flew off in the same south east direction in which it initially had been traveling. about 5 min. later either it or another jet flew in from the west directly over the area in which the light had initially been, it then accelerated noticably and flew off towards vancouver island, acctually towards comox airforce base.we continued watching the skies and had no further sighting, after about an hour we decided to go in as it was late and cold.**my distint impression was that it was watching us, watching it** the next night we were out again watching the skies as we had done the previous night, we did not see anything in the sky that was out of the ordinary when my friend said what's that! the other fellow and myself looked in the direction in which he was looking and i saw a light on the other side of the street in which his house was located, at the enterance of his driveway he has a couple of giant boulders one on either side of the enerance. the light appeared just behind one of them as though it was peeking around from behind it. the light appeared to be about the size of a soccerball from where we were. as soon as we realized it was there (a time frame of about 2-3 seconds) my friends dog began to growl. it had been sitting with us, it did not move (the dog) i picked up my flashlight and began walking fairly quickly towards it, i turned on my flashlght and shone it towards light, i moved to the end of the driveway next to my truck and stopped and observed it. i began to evaluate the light, 2-3 seconds later my flashlight dimmed out from full light to no light in about 4 seconds. i began resonable deducting as to what it might be...the first thing came into my mind was that it was a porch light of someones house being barely visible through the trees. i realized remembered that there were no houses in that direction. then i thought maybeit was the underside of an alder leaf , when you shine a lght off the bottom of the alder leafs they are very light green\\white and sometimes appear to be a light. then the thought of a light from someones house came back to mind,,....** not my own thoughts resurfacing,,,,for say but more like the thought was being put in my head. i really had the impression\\feeling that the thoughts were incoming as apposed to being generated in my own head**. i remembered that i had concluded that it could not be a house light. then the alder leaf theory came back into my head so i decided to test the theory,.... i picked up a baseball sized rock from off the ground and tossed it directly where the alder tree would have been had the light actually been a leaf. my friend has several alder trees about 10 to 15 feet tall next to the boulders at the head of his driveway,...when the rock landed on the edge of the pavement on our side of the road\\pavement not only did i realize that it was not a leaf but that the light was in fact on the other side of the road, a distance of (from myself to it about 45-50 feet) about 1 second after i got a feeling of conclusion and urgency, about 1 second after that the light blinked out. more than a blinking out it was as though it had sped off directly away from me, like when on star trek the enterprise jumps to warp speed and gets smaller and smaller in the fraction of a second. there were many trees that would have been in it's way and it would have had to navigate it's way through them creating an irregular zigzag path. it did not it just blinked out, got smaller and smaller almost all at once. the light was a smoky white color not just a big dot it was like a very dense swirling ball of smoke, not a lot of distinctive lines or details just emough to be ditinguished. we began talking about it and my friend whom had initially seen it desribed it as the same swirling ball of smoky stuff but, he had seen, what could best be described as golen(ish) eye. thats it just an eye. we never saw anything else that evening. the one fellow whom had been with us freaked out and we had to calm him down for he thought we were seeing spirits and i am pretty darn sure that it was not for we had seen the light in the sky as well as a jet(which i am positive was a fighter jet from the comox airforce base)."],"Log Number":"CA-03272007-0016","Latitude":"49.472933","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-123.750368","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.472933,+-123.750368(6661)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6661) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/31/0001 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"British Columbia","Country":"Canada","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Sechelt","There were no other sightings in Sechelt on or around October 29th 0001"],"City":"Sechelt","Date of the Event":"10/31/0001 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"6661","Summary":"shape was unknown but, the light was round and very reddish orange/crimson red.","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6661.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6661.html"]}
