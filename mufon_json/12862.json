We noticed an object that seemed very high up that was blimp-shaped and white in color. I don't remember what made us look. It was the middle of the day and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Also, there were a couple of what looked to be fighter jets following the object at a distance. This sound of the jets may have been why we looked up to begin with, but I really can't remember. We both watched for a minute or so and agreed we had seen a UFO. Neither of us made a big deal out of it, and to be honest I've never really grasped what I may have seen until now. To this day, my friend and I still agree about what we saw. I've never taken the time to officially report it, and I figured I would."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.366495,+-89.519248(12862)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12862) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12862.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12862.html"],"Log Number":"US-10012008-0003","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
