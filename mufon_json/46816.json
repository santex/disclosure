We where out there for about 5 minutes when we started seeing lights in the sky from the south. As we where watching them the lights went from one to two lights brightening and dulling out. I ran in the house to get the camcorder. When i cam back out side the light where still there and there where around ten different lights in the sky. i ran to a drainage pond to try to get a better view with out the trees. I was able to see 4 to 5 different lights in the sky all moving in different direction. At one time there was a flash of light that seemed to come from behind me that lighted up the trees for a brief moment. I was watching one light the was flying from the south to north, as i was watching it there seemed to be a beam of light that showed up in front of it. The beam showed up more then once. when i was at the drainage pond my wife was able to see a abject above he. it was rectangle shaped and about the size of a football field."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
