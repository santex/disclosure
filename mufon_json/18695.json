{"divs":["Sighting Detailshi, i have a crazy story. i was coming out of walmart in boardman last night at a little after 11 pm. i was walking toward my vehicle and this light in the sky caught my eyes. i look up and saw 3 yellow lights in a straight line coming toward me. at first i thought hellicopters. thay were very low and moving very slow. then they changed formation and turned north toward lowes. i drove over to lowes parking lot and got out of my car. they went right over me and i couldnt hear any engine noise. thats crazy because they were low as emergency hellicopters fly. i should of heard some kind of noise. also i couldnt see any kind of shape to them which was also wierd because of how low they were. shortly after they passed over lowes they disappeared. as i was watching this a young couple pulled in and also saw this happening. it was unbelieveable and awsome!"],"Region":"Ohio","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/15/2009 11:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.10448,+-80.642119(18695)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18695) map </A>","Latitude":"41.10448","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-08162009-0007","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18695.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18695.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/15/2009 11:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","City":"Youngstown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"18695","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.642119","Summary":"Three bright yellow flickering lights.","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Youngstown","There were no other sightings in Youngstown on or around August 15th 2009"]}
