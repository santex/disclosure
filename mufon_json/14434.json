We were conversing and we both saw this round object in the sky and it had lights on it. It kind of zig zigged and then like a shot was gone. We were both mesmerized and was quiet, after it was gone, we went home and told her husband about it since he used to work for the Navy and he thought we were nuts. My sister gave you a statement and I was afraid to tell you about it for fear of being called nuts, but I did see it and what she said was the truth. I hope this helps in anyway."],"Region":"Oregon","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
