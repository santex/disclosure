At 7:30 I took my pups out for a break. In the distance to the west over the Gulf I could see a black cloud in the shape of a Y on its side. Under the Y was a small gold orb doing figure 8's in and under the cloud. It was a goldish yellow color in appearance, I guess due to the sunset. It only lasted a few seconds maybe 3-5 seconds. Just long enough to catch my eye and not long enough to be sure you were seeing what you thought you were seeing. I was standing on my frount porch when the object caught my eye, because it was so bright and moving in and under the black cloud. I did not know what it was but I thought it very curious to see something like this in and under the black cloud. All of a sudden the yellow gold orb just did not appear again. As if it knew I was watching it. Or had some other place to be.It almost appeared to be playing in the cloud."],"Weather Factors":"Rain, Light","Log Number":"US-11192009-0010"}
