We had made a few laps around the pond and as we came up to the top of the steep hill there, over our right shoulder there was a bright green flash of light in the sky. It didn't last but a few seconds and it didn't streak very far across the sky, maybe, from my perspective, an inch, or what I'd guess from it's perspective 10 - 20 miles. Immediately me and my friend turned to each other and asked if we had seen it. It was quite creepy to have seen. In my opinion the only thing it could have been otherwise was an asteroid extremely rich in copper (as it burns green, as it would upon impact with the atmosphere) but it was unidentified, and flying, and I'm not 100% sure if I'd believe the asteroid possibility after seeing it."],"Tags":"City"}
