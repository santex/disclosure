Having seen a hang-glider land in the approperate spot just a few minutes earlier, we (myself, my 3 yr old Jesse and the dog Vixen) stared at the really bright light in the sky coming over the mountain. At first, we thought it was another hang glider but it seemed to be reflecting the sun so we couldn't see anything beyond the reflection of the sun. No shape or size. Bottom line is that we saw it thinking that it was a hang glider but it disapeared into a cloud. I watched the cloud for 11 minutes before I ran in to get the phone. My dog was still watching when I came back out. Not sure what it was but we're all inside tonight."],"Latitude":"38.874225","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.874225,+-106.983143(5218)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5218) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/08/2006 06:30 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Crested Butte","There were no other sightings in Crested Butte on or around August 8th 2006"],"Summary":"USA Mountain Time Zone- Reflection off the sun","Case Number":"5218","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5218.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5218.html"],"Longitude":"-106.983143","Date Submitted":"08/08/2006 06:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Crested Butte"}
