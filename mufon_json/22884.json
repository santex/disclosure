I had noticed it far away and but then when I stopped at a light it was right in front of me so i turned off my radio and rolled down the window as i got out my phone to take a picture. i didnt hear any noise of a plane or helicopter so i knew it was different so i took a pictures. I had also noticed as i was driving away i could see the light through the trees, which wouldnt happen with spotlights from a plane. But as you can see from the picture i took the object is significantly brighter than the street lights. Throughout the event i was very calm until after i lost sight with the object and pieced together everything i saw."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.954345,+-75.160609(22884)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22884) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"looked light a plane or helicopter but too fast low bright and quiet","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"04/18/2010 10:55 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22884.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22884.html"],"Latitude":"39.954345","Longitude":"-75.160609","Log Number":"US-04182010-0009","Date of the Event":"04/18/2010 10:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"New Jersey"}
