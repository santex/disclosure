I was in the Air Force for 7yrs. Me and my girlfriend were star gazing because we woke up early and I figured I could see the Comet Hartley. It was around 5:30 am. I noticed some odd lights moving very very fast. They were flying from north to south. They were silent and looked lower than normal aircraft. You could see the stars between them, they were shaped like an advil gel capsule but bronze in color. They were flying in perfect sequence."],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"10/15/2010 06:02 UTC","Summary":"3 egg shaped bronze lights in triangle form","Case Number":"25908","Object Shape":"Egg, Triangle","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON"}
