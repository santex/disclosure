{"trends":[""],"Region":"Ohio","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn my way to work at 5:15 AM. Driving by a car lot with a lighted lot. The object came over the road just a little ahead of me and very low. It appeared like two diamonds butted together at the big end and was rotating clock wise very slowly. Color was dull grey with no reflection and every other plane was black also with no reflection. I watched it fly across the road in the ambient light from the car lot. The craft had no lights or sound so as it got away from the ambient light I lost it over the woods. Heading North West. My first impression was that this was some kind of a satellite but after talking it over with the wife Im not so sure."],"Date Submitted":"07/12/2013 12:34 UTC","Object Features":"Window(s)","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.418587","Date of the Event":"11/10/2008 05:15 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.418587,+-82.900353(48885)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48885) map </A>","Summary":"{kt}diamond shape, clockwise rotation, passed overhead, moving slow, not a sound.","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"US-07122013-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"48885","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48885.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/48885_submitter_file1__spudnik.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48885.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-82.900353","Object Shape":"Diamond"}
