The road when it lets out from Athens is mlk jr drive and changes to 441(?) I think. Just before J.J's and after the Bulldog Inn motel is the stretch of road where we saw it. We saw a massive white light of a unusual shape at a high speed go over us and then down to the ground. I can't belive there wasn't a news report about it or something. It wasn't a meteor because of it's shape and size (if a meteor that big hit the ground they would have told us). Very weird stuff... we both saw it till it went lower than the tree line... we were shocked by it."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.382366","Log Number":"US-02082009-0013","City":"Athens","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Bright LARGE white light, low flying, fast, possibly crashing?","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15394.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15394_submitter_file1__Map.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15394.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Other","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"02/07/2009 06:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Latitude":"33.955802","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Athens","There were no other sightings in Athens on or around February 7th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
