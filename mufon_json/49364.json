We like to observe stars in evening notice big huge star like; grabbed binoculars to look at it better & was surprised to see it flash blue light randomly being stationary for over an hour then started to descend very slowly (like an L) straight down then going towards right (east). That has been going on for 3 days. Yesterday, 07-31-2013 husband & I surprised to see it much earlier around 7:30 pm skies where not dark yet stayed there for couple of hrs. We went back inside house & at 8:30 pm we went back out & it was gone. It made no sound at all, airplanes & helicopters where passing by & we could hear planes & helicopter but this object made no sound It seemed like a mother ship it was huge."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.489036,+-118.625655(49364)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49364) map </A>","Longitude":"-118.625655","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.489036"}
