My friend recently came into ownership of some pictures that have been around since 1945 (as far back as we can find out) We thought this one was pretty strange, as its definetly not a plane or tank boat etc. All that we have been able to find out is that they belonged to a serviceman who was based at RAF Woodbridge around 1945. The scan is quite low resolution, I will try to scan it at a better quality, if its of any interest to you.
