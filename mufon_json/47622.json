Driving home around 8:30 we looked to the southeast and saw an orange spiral smoke trail, then noticed an orange orb a bit of distance above it that looked to be standing still. It started slowly moving north, stopped again, when a sudden burst of light and a double teardrop looking cloud appeared. The orb then appeared from behind the cloud, and quickly took off going due east."],"Log Number":"US-05252013-0005","Latitude":"30.107793","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 66 other sightings in Jacksonville","There were no other sightings in Jacksonville on or around May 24th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-81.621975","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"47622","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.107793,+-81.621975(47622)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47622) map </A>","Country":"United States","Summary":"Same as seen in Miramar and Lake","City":"Jacksonville","Date of the Event":"05/24/2013 08:30 UTC"}
