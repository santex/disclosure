{"Case Number":"35049","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01222012-0004","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home on the I95 southbound and exited on Donald Ross rd heading east. As I was waiting at the red light just east of I95, I noticed a very bright white light, thinking at first \"that is an odd street light so high up\" taking note also that the street light have a \"yellowish tinge\" to them. I also noticed that it was not moving towards me or away or up or down from me and it was very steady with no blinking lights but very white like a PURE white light. As I continued to observe this light, it just \"blinked out\" literally, there was no after glow when it \"blinked out\". The traffic signal turned green and I scanned the sky where this was and there was nothing. I arrived home approximately 5 minutes later and tried to make sense of what that was."],"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Jupiter","Latitude":"26.883067","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/22/2012 02:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright light in Jupiter Florida","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Jupiter","There were no other sightings in Jupiter on or around January 22nd 2012"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.883067,+-80.103451(35049)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35049) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35049.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35049.html"],"Region":"Florida","Longitude":"-80.103451","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"01/22/2012 03:03 UTC"}
