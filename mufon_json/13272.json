St Paul has an airport so I thought I saw a plain taking off from the airport and that the sun was hitting the plain funny because it didn���������t really look like a plain. I stood there watching it, not thinking it was anything but a plain taking off heading east. As it was taking off it hovered, a bit, thinking it was just because of the distance I continued to watch, then it move off course and started to head west, it looked like it was still over downtown St Paul when it turned south and disappeared behind a building, I stood there for as long as I could but it never reappeared and I had to go back to work. I wished so much that I had my camera phone with me to take a picture of this object. I am not sure what I saw, it was a bright reflective light moving in a very odd way."],"Log Number":"US-10272008-0030","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Minnesota","Latitude":"44.958767","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.958767,+-93.106039(13272)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13272) map </A>","Case Number":"13272","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
