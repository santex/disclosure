I was stopped at a traffic light when I noticed in my periphereal vision a bright object in the eastern sky. The object was bright at first, like a star, but the lights faded and I could see what appeared to be a dark, triangular object that appeared to hover or rotate in place. After about 2 or 3 seconds it shot off into the distance - faster than a shooting star. This was not a jet, airplane, or satellite. I was completely sober (didn't even have any coffee) and had a brand new pair of contact lens in. Were there any other sightings around this time?"],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Texarkana","There were no other sightings in Texarkana on or around July 31st 2009"],"Summary":"UFO","Tags":"City","City":"Texarkana"}
