It was heard from wilmington n.c. to myrtle beach. What was not reported and neither did any reporter get the story, that when I heard it I walked outside to my balcony and green lights were illuminating over the bay. Low and no order other than not one light was on when another was.off on off on. Look to me like communication. Green. Very bright clean green. Youtube offers a look at what was happening. (oak island sonic boom) There was an event. 10 12 15 ??? Couple weeks ago I did see one light up. Silver or alloy, dirty, black dust with a dome with dark tinted windows like the Soveriegn Ship. Two levels. Engine what ever lower part, with 360 veiw glass on top. I seen it when it turned 4 lights on. two red two white and reflected back on it's self. The structure of the lights look like cylinder tubes with colored glass just like at a concert stage. I'm sure this one carried occupants. I was thinking human because of size of compartment. Just looked like something humans would make. Well whatever. I seen it."],"Date of the Event":"12/09/2011 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-81.160134","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Case Number":"43168","Log Number":"US-10112012-0027","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":[],"Latitude":"33.842001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43168.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43168.html"],"Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"multiple events since dec. 9th 2011","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/11/2012 07:36 UTC"}
