It was not moving, and pretty far away. The video was taken with a Canon L2 Pro Camcorder (HI-8) with a 15 x zoom lens. I don't know what it was. It seemed to glow with every color in the rainbow. Pause the screen, and you will know what I am talking about. I recently got this camera, so I am not good with it yet. (lots of buttons, etc). It disappeared as the sun was coming up. So I think it was a star. Although there were several stars in the horizon, this one was something that gave off a great amount of brilliance. Can someone tell me what it may be? thanks"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/22/2008 05:00 UTC","Latitude":"32.26564","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-110.927069","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12177.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12177_submitter_file2__memory047.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12177.html"],"Log Number":"US-08222008-0012","Summary":"Multi-colored UFO or star?","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"12177","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around August 22nd 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
