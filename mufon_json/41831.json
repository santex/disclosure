I turned to see a bright light spherical shape traveling from East to West above the tree line. It was not traveling real fast as would a meteorite but as fast as a helicopter. It had a perfect shape with a halo circling around it. It continue on its path with the same speed, until I could not see it anymore, I believe the whole encounter was a little shorter than a minute. I know the meteor shower was happening during this time, but it did not have any other color than white nor did it have a tail, the object was not high up in the sky but above the tree line, during this duration it did not increase or decrease in speed, it held the same path and speed during duration."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":[],"Case Number":"41831"}
