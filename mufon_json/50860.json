It came from the direction of the house from the edge of the grass. I would have never noticed it if it wouldn't have been reflective of the sun light that evening. It then proceeded to cross the drive way in what looked like three steps, which the drive would usually take a normal man to cross in about 15 to 20 large steps. I noticed it was a chrome color very reflective I could see it had arms an d legs but could not see the hands or feet almost like they were cupped. I also observed it had a pointed-elongated head almost Egyptian like. It then disappeared into the wooded pasture. Now while heading to and from work or while driving out in the pasture I feel watched, and I catch glimpses of it on the drive, and dirt road beside the property."],"Longitude":"-98.957871","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.103844,+-98.957871(50860)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50860) map </A>","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Other","Summary":"Saw a chrome-colored entity walking across the road","Case Number":"50860","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50860.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50860.html"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Rising Star","There were no other sightings in Rising Star on or around September 12th 2013"]}
