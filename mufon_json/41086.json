A few minutes later another three objects ascended one by one, again fading out after and mixing with the stars; after witnessing the first six orbs I went inside to call my dad, when we returned we witnessed the same pattern repeat with about another six to nine orbs with the same characteristics, after a little over 20 minutes it stopped and we were left scratching our heads."],"Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Orange orbs ascending in the southern sky","Object Flight Path":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Mexico"}
