I do not believe it was aircraft due to the color.avoca airport is not far away and I am used to seeing different types of aircraft.It was much different than any aircraft in the area.I only observed it for a short duration due to the fact that the road is on a mountain pass and no place to pull off the road."],"Country":"United States","City":"Scranton","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Scranton","There were no other sightings in Scranton on or around January 21st 2010"],"Latitude":"41.416369","Date of the Event":"01/21/2010 06:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21584.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21584.html"],"Longitude":"-75.661312","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.416369,+-75.661312(21584)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21584) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"21584","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Summary":"An orange object flying on a SSE to a NNW flight path while traveling rt 347","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"01/21/2010 11:34 UTC"}
