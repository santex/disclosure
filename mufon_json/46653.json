{"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsHad gone to bed early Saturday night. Woke up at 3am Sunday morning. Made some coffee then walked outside to the back yard to have a cigarette. Was looking up at the sky to the east when I saw a very large triangle shaped mass of lights moving very swiftly from SE to NE in a straight line with the wide end of the triangle in the front and the narrow end at the back. At least 12 circular lights. Object looked almost translucent like it had no color to it except the lights which were a dull white. I lost sight of it very quickly. Estimate approximately 10 seconds from first sight of it, SE to losing sight of it towards the NE when it was out of my view. Silent. After I lost sight of it I heard what sounded like a loud \"shot\" or \"backfire\" and then dogs barking in the vicinity of Bissonett Street, but do not believe the sound or barking were caused by the craft. If I had to guess the size, it was easily a half a city block long."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Went out to the back yard to have a cigarette.
