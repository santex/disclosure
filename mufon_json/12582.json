Casually, I looked north and spotted a shiny, silver object at a distance. At first I thought it was a plane, except there was no noise, and it didn't move. I couldn't judge how far or high it was. I only noticed that it reflected sun and was shaped like an egg cut in half with the flat part parallel to the ground. When I moved to get a better look, I looked down. I looked up and the object was gone. I scanned the sky, believing I had confused the object for a plane heading to or from DIA. I thought that I would spot it either east or west. There were no clouds in the sky, but I was unable to locate what I saw. I have debated reporting this since the event, doubting what I saw and trying to convince myself it was only my imagination."],"Longitude":"-104.930868","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Commerce City","There were no other sightings in Commerce City on or around July 20th 2008"]}
