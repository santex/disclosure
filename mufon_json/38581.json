We all concurred that it appeared to be a satellite. There were no blinking lights or any other color than white. It looked about the same size and intensity as the north star. It moved in a flat line trajectory east to west for roughly 2 minutes before making a 20 degree turn to the north. My friends and I found this very unusual for a satellite. Shortly thereafter it disappeared for 20 seconds or so, and then reappeared doubling in intensity along the same flight path. 5 seconds later it disappeared again. Within a minute or two me and my friends observed 2 very high flying aircraft along the same flight path. They were clearly aircraft with both stationary and blinking red lights and kept changing their flight path as if they were searching for something."],"Tags":"City","Region":"South Carolina","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"05/28/2012 10:52 UTC"}
