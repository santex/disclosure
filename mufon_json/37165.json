{"Longitude":"-76.638781","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Shiny reflective cylindrical hovering object","divs":["sighting detailsi was driving west on hwy 32 coming from fort meade, md, moving at approx. 60 mph. somewhere near the vicinity of the exit to 295, i just happened to glance up toward the sky looking southwest. i noticed a shiny\\ reflective cylindrical object hovering in the sky. my first thought was that it must have been a passenger airliner, but i noticed that it was not moving in a linear fashion, but hovering! i kept glancing at the object to ensure that i was indeed witnessing a hovering object. i began to scan the skies for other flying objects and spotted what was clearly a passenger airliner moving from north to south, and appeared to be further away, in terms of direct line of sight, than the ufo. although the plane appeared farther away, i could clearly distinguish it as an airplane, moving in a linear fashion, whereas i was unable to positively identify the hovering object. i glanced back toward the ufo and it was indeed stationary and not moving, and i could not identify wing, rotars or anything that would indicate that it was of earthly origin. i passed a row of tall trees on the south side of the highway, which obstructed my view, and i briefly lost visual contact with the ufo. when i finally cleared the row of trees, which no more than 10 seconds (approx.) elapsed, i looked back in the direction of the ufo only to discover that it had completely vanished. i kept glancing back toward the direction where the ufo was initially spotted, but i was unable to regain visual contact."],"trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.050555","Region":"Maryland","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"04/06/2012 11:07 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date of the Event":"04/06/2012 02:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37165.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37165.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.050555,+-76.638781(37165)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37165) map </A>","Case Number":"37165","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-04062012-0014","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
