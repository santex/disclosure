I parked my Pontiac at the curb in front of the house and we all carried in bags of groceries up the sidewalk leading to the house. My wife enter the front door first, followed by my two daughters, age 10 years and 12 years, then my son, age 14 years. As I walked up the two steps to the small porch I looked up in the sky and out of the corner of my eye saw moment. There were no clouds in the sky. The object was traveling slowly west to east. It was huge and I called my family to come quickly. We all stood on the porch and I said, ���Don���t talk, observe everything and we���ll talk later���. It was about three telephone poles high, (120 feet high), moving very slow. We lived in the suburbs, no was one was outside and there was no traffic. We were one house from the corner intersection. The object was across the intersection to our right. The object extended over four houses and their yards plus the street making it about 500 feet (approx) from the leading to the trailing edge. It had multi-colored flashing lights around the parameter of the edge. No sound whatsoever was heard. It moved past the houses over a level field for about one mile away from me. Off in the distance I remember how bright the lights were on a very busy street running north and south one mile in the distance, and thought to myself about all the people who would see this object. We watch the object move over the distant street, another one-forth of a mile over business, including a large parking area for FedCo. It then moved over a highway (395) and about another one eighth mile to another field that was near the end of Montgomery airport, (where I had flown as a student pilot). It stopped and a white light (that you could see through) shown down from the perimeter of the object to the field below; it now seemed to be only 50 feet above the field. Then, in the center of the object, small opaque white pieces of irregular shape,(about the size of a football) fell to the ground. Then the lights below the object went off, a moment pause, and the object zipped into the sky at about 30 degrees, becoming a small dot of white as it disappeared in the upper atmosphere. Misc info: I was an amateur astronomer (ground my own 6\" lens). After seeing the object we just sat at the table saying nothing and very calm. My son did not see red lights but he saw green lights among other colors. I don���t remember seeing the color green, but rather red. Could the flashing lights be a means of tranquilizing human? Nothing was ever seen in the newspapers. My wife, a staunch Baptist, would never talk about the incident."],"Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Summary":"Circular, approx 150 feet in diameter, thin at edge to bulging at center.
