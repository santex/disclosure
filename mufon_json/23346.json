{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsA number of us were outside on our deck that has an unobstructed view to the East. My wife and her neice noticed several object that look at first like airplane moving in a northerly direction. We can see plane all the time approching the Portland International airport but these objects looked a little differant. At first 2 looked to rise from the horizon and then several other followed what look like the same pattern or direction. Chris works at the airport and call one of her fellow empyoee to see if there was any air traffic at the time. He report only two aircraft in the area. We saw 10-12 lights rise and move north. We think we saw UFO's over Portland."],"Summary":"Multiple objects rising and moving north","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"23346","Date Submitted":"05/18/2010 12:37 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/17/2010 10:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-122.674987","Latitude":"45.531572","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Oregon","Log Number":"US-05182010-0004","City":"Portland","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.531572,+-122.674987(23346)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23346) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23346.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23346.html"],"trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were 2 other sightings in Portland on or around May 17th 2010"]}
