My stepdaughter recently took a trip to the mountains. She took some photos with her Blackberry Playbook. After reviewing them she seen objects in the photos. Knowing that I watch UFO informatiuon on TV, she showed them to me. It seems there is a object in the photo with a airsteam behind it. The stream is in the top right of the object, making it seem that it is going downward. When I asked if she seen anything she said no she was not paying attention, and neither was her Grandmother. Wish I was there! You need to see this picture. She said they just were driving and stopped to photograph the mountain tops. So have a look at this. Its pretty cool!"],"Summary":"Step took photos of objects in the Mountains"}
