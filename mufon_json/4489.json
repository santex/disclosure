Thats when i saw the object.At first i thought it was a plane but then i realized that it was flying in a direction that planes in the area did not. it was also flying extremely low to the ground. it was noticed at the left side of the window and moved quickly to the right.the lights slowly pulsated on and off but the light never fully went away it would only get soft. i watched until it disappeared off the right side of the window then i ran to tell my mom."],"Case Number":"4489","Country":"United States","Region":"Arizona","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/23/2006 12:00 UTC"}
