I went straight, and ended up behind a mountain that is nearby. I did not see anything more. The light was white, and though it could possibly have been a meteorite, it went straight downward, which I have never seen a meteorite do, and it was evening, so I am not sure that it was dark enough for me to have seen a meteorite. I looked around to assess whether it was dark enough, and saw that there were a few stars overhead, but in the direction that the light had been seen there were no stars yet in the sky, and it was not very dark yet. I don't know whether or not it had anything to do with the plane, but it happened just as the plane had flown out of the area that the light came from. It almost looked like something had tried to hit the plane and had missed not literally, but that was the sequence of things. I dont know what to think of it."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"04/02/2003 06:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/02/2003 06:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.730369","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Tags":"City","Log Number":"","Longitude":"-86.586104","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Huntsville","There were no other sightings in Huntsville on or around April 2nd 2003"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Alabama"}
