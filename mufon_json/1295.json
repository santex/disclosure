Noticed a bright object in the sky and first thought it was anairplane. It was moving very quickly and very bright and had a vapor trail. Itwas heading North-North East. We saw it for at least 2min. It didnt appear tohave a strobe light like airplanes do. It moved in what seemed to be a straightflight path and did not appear to change altitude. It was a steady movement anda section of the vapor trail remained iluminated for at least 10min afterpassing. It disappeared very quickly in the direction of North-NorthEast.
