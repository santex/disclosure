I stared at the area to the north about 60 Degrees for about 10-15 seconds and I saw what I guessed was a star and as I was staring at it started to get brighter and brighter till It was like headlight or flashlight bright. It held its brightness for about 3 or 4 seconds and just disappeared. In most counts I would call it a shooting star. The problem is it had to have been coming directly towards me, as it made no change in direction."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in El Paso","There were no other sightings in El Paso on or around June 25th 2011"],"Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/25/2011 09:40 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.76022,+-106.480811(29724)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29724) map </A>","Object Features":"None"}
