The sunset was bright and dramatically orange and pink, behind me. I was driving 30 mph and as I approached a railroad crossing and happened to look up at something shimmering in the eastern sky. It looked low and I assume the radiant sunset made it sparkle, but it also looked as though it may have been slightly illuminated. At first I thought it was a balloon someone had let go of since things in the sky while you are driving can be deceiving. I watched it for about three seconds and realized it was not a balloon because it was moving too fast. It was precise and it 'zoomed' down over the eastern horizon until it was out of sight. I just kept watching and driving."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Circle, Diamond, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like, Other, Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/13/2010 05:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-12132010-0006","Case Number":"26965","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date Submitted":"12/13/2010 09:53 UTC","Summary":"Sparkling fast-moving object descended toward eastern horizon","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
