I was hesitant to learn how and where to report this & were it not for the helicopter & aircraft in the sky as I watched this object,I most likely wouldn't be writing this note.I am curious as to whether anyone else saw this object.Were it not for points of reference,(my window frame & the trees)I'm not sure that I would have continued watching object for a half hour."],"Case Number":"46904","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Stoneham","There were no other sightings in Stoneham on or around April 21st 2013"],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"42.485404","Date of the Event":"04/21/2013 08:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
