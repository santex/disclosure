{"divs":["Sighting Detailsit was early morning before daylight i was seeing my mother off to work. i was watching her leave the drive way and i stood staring out the front window looking at the hills when i notice 2 large headlights and thought that there were people 4 wheeling in the hills. the lights stopped and then moved straight up in the air. i then thought that it must be a hellicopter. the sun was then coming out and i continued to watch the lights and the object moved toward our housing area. by the time it was in clear view the sun was up and it was in no way anything i'd ever even heard of. i even called 911 to ask if there were any gov't things going on and i remember her asking me why? i told here because what im seeing isnt anything i've ever seen before. lol she told me to get up at the same time the next morning and see if i saw it again. displeased we ended the call. oh i did ask if anyone else had called in about this she said no. it flew directly over our house and the detail was strange because there really wasnt that much. it was black, coal black the front was the shape of a ball and i could see windows but they too were black the only reason i knew they were windows was because of the shine. a short way behind, the middle of the ship was thin tubular with 2 rather short wings not a perfect triangular shape but wide then narrowed to a rounded point or end. past the wings the tubular shape continued to the back and end of ship where there were 3 fins as a plane has and behind those were round rocket ship engines [ok i dont know what else to call them] but when u see a rocket ship [nasa] go up it was just like that except it only glowed and there was no noise just a low hum. i did get up the next day but it was a little bit later than the day before, there was nothing and nothing on the news anywhere. i watched this ship from the hills of mira vista and went to the back yard and watched leave. to this day...no one has ever reported seeing something of this shape. and i'll tell you if they do that's something that should be investigated. just for a bit of info. my brother-in-law's brother was there at area 51 [as he told us] he said yes it was true he had seen them. another siting was in concord ca my best friend who at the time i hadn't met but they had a block party and they all saw a ship that hovered over their court for about 20 minutes. my reactions....i was in ahh and surprised, excited and then for a moment a little bit afraid that they might take me or my dogs out from the back yard. please call if you need any more info. thank you, pam"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4370.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4370.html"],"Longitude":"-121.800709","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"11/30/1974 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Antioch","There were no other sightings in Antioch on or around November 30th 1974"],"Case Number":"4370","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Summary":"long black extremely slow moving over house about 3-5 stories above","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"38.008881","Log Number":"US-02032006-0028","City":"Antioch","Date Submitted":"11/30/1974 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.008881,+-121.800709(4370)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4370) map </A>","Object Features":"Window(s), Wings, Other","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cylinder","Country":"United States"}
