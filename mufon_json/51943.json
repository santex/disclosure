Every other night the light object has appear it has been at sunset eventually blending into the background trying to look like a star. It starts in the north and heads south southwest every night at first it looked as if it was scanning the area tonight i can tell you that it is. As the light object moves south west he begins to disappear and I think this is it the end of its run, but something else happen. as it vanishes a new light appears larger and more blurred out and covering two quarters of the skyline, a giant white glow now sits where one has never been before. The light object reappears and this time it has a weird motion it turns to the north and the light gets bright, but as it turns to the south the light diminishes, I now know for a fact as this light object continues its path to the new light source that it is scanning for something. I will continue tracking it and will continue reporting ."],"Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"{kt}Light Appearing every night","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","City":"Warwick","Log Number":"US-10302013-0015","Region":"Rhode Island","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Warwick","There were no other sightings in Warwick on or around October 30th 2013"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"51943","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51943.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51943.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"41.703691"}
