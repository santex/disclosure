We were out there in the dark country star gazing and UFO hunting. It was a perfect clear sky. We noticed a bright bluish white light that seemed to be too big to be a star..NW of our position. At first sight i started focusing in the camera and couldnt get a lock on it. I then realized it is headed right at us. It wasnt stationary anymore. SE flight pattern. It got straight above us above 600ft over head it just turned out its bright white light. No other lights were visible. There was no sound at all and it looked like the shape of this thing was blocking out the sky behind it.. It looked like a huge triangle. We got really nervous since it stopped right over us. We jumped back in the car and got to civilization rather quickly. Its one of things where you think.. i should be careful what i wish for."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29771.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29771.html"],"Summary":"Was star gazing/ ufo hunting.
