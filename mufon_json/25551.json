It was moving slowly the entire time and then it just stopped and stayed in the same place in the sky and appeared to get duller. I tried to run get a better view and for a few seconds had obstructed view due to trees but when I got to an opening in tress I could not find it. I was alone in the parking lot of my condo and was hoping a neighbor would appear so that I could show them this object but no one showed up. I was outside with my dog. He did not have a leash on and I was just following him as he sniffed around, looking up at the very bright moon and sky. I thought at first it was a hot air baloon and I was talking to myself saying what is that, what the hell is that, hoping a neighbor would drive or walk up so I could show someone. I did not have a camera or even my phone with me so no pictures."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09252010-0003","Case Number":"25551","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25551.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25551.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
