I saw two white objects flying across the sky at a decent pace. I thought they might have been planes until I realized they didn't have blinking lights. After a couple minutes two planes were visible in the sky, so I ruled the plane possibility out of the question. I pulled my camera phone out and recorded a video, after ten minutes of watching these lights, they took off. The two objects were not very close together, but were heading in the same direction."],"City":"Sanders","Tags":"City","Region":"Kentucky","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Disc, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Saw two objects flying, thought they were planes until I actually spotted two planes."}
