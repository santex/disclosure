The one light in the middle was constant and did not blink, while the other two on the ends blinked alternately. There also was a constant red light and appeared to be in the middle. I noticed the object because it was really low, and obviously wasn't a plane coming from the west because it was off route. At first I thought it was a helicopter with the flashing lights, then I approached it while driving in my car and it seemed to be moving pretty slow. I turned around and as i did that it changed direction (Northeast) then suddenly it turned back toward the East and began to accelerate much quicker then when I was previously close to it. During the sighting I definitely knew it wasn't a regular plane. The only possible explanation was that it was a stealth, but i highly doubt that. After the sighting, I am convinced it was a UFO merely by its lights, speed, and sudden change of direction. I eventually lost sight when it accelerated towards the East. My view of this object lasted from about 3-5 minutes."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32091.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32091.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"32091","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.049968,+-111.087321(32091)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32091) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"UFO sighting in Maricopa County","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"09/25/2011 10:30 UTC"}
