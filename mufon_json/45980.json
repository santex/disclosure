I noticed unusual flashing lights in the sky to my left looking North. At first glance I thought it was a helicopter. As it was flying closer to me heading in a South East direction under 500ft. in the sky. I soon realized it was not a helicopter or plane ! It was morphing and changing shape as it flew kind of wobbly through the sky. The whole time emitting bright red and white lights all over it. The object was solid, yet constantly changing shape. It almost appeared to be in distress to make a landing somewhere.When I saw this happening I was kind of in shock! The object appeared to go very low in the sky and then disappeared out of my view looking South East. This all occurred in day light facing away from the direction of the sun. The event lasted 3-5 minutes, did not get pictures with cell phone."],"Date Submitted":"03/01/2013 03:23 UTC","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.759061,+-118.024709(45980)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45980) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/28/2013 05:23 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-03012013-0005","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Tags":"City"}
