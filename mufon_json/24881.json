Coming to a stop as there was no traffic, I witnessed a large triangluar craft about 100 feet long by 75 feet wide pass over me. Both sides of the road are lined with mature pines, and at first glance, I thought it was a military cargo plane about to crash, but there was no noise, only a slight hum, and I had the window down looking out at that time. It was so low I could see individual rivots or bolts in the metal. There was one white light in the center of the craft lighting up the underbelly. But once again, only a slight electrical hum. It crossed highway 100 about 3-4 miles south of the floyd county line. travelling west to east, and then turned north, going up the valley. It was travelling extremely slow, and I was amazed that it did not fall out of the sky."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Georgia","City":"Rome","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.260918,+-85.155303(24881)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24881) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/01/2010 12:59 UTC","Longitude":"-85.155303","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
