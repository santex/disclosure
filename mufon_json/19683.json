Now I am constantly looking up at the sky because of a previous non reported sighting. I figured this time I would report it. So I normally walk down the alley to this store..as I was walking I looked up to the east sky and saw a very bright star. This was just a regular star but below it..more to the left..I saw another star falling slowly down. I have seen many shooting stars and this was no shooting star. It moved very slowly , I had to stop for a few seconds to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me. It was still moving directly down then suddenly disappeared. I am sure this was a unidentified flying object,I wasn't too terrible shocked because this isn't the first time I've seen one. My previous experience was well unexplainable really..for that I have witnesses this time I was alone.This sighting lasted about a minute."],"trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"Very odd"}
