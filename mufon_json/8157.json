It was hovering in place over a hilly treeline approximately 7-9 miles away. I immediately observed it through my field glasses, and in about 30 seconds it began to slowly move at about a slightly downward angle to the east from its position in the northwest sky. Even though some distance away, the nucleus of the object still appeared approximately the circumference of a slightly wabbling and slight shape changing circumference of a pencil eraser with yellow and red colors bursting from its outer edges. The center of the object was a very bright white color. I am a former career Airman, and from my knowledge of things that fly, this did not appear to be any kind of identifiable aircraft."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Washington","Date of the Event":"10/15/2007 08:30 UTC","Case Number":"8157","Object Features":"Other","Latitude":"47.055241","City":"McCleary","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in McCleary","There were no other sightings in McCleary on or around October 15th 2007"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.055241,+-123.260501(8157)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8157) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Windy, Rain","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-10162007-0007"}
