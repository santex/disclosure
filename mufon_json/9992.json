then looking at the moon thinking to myself no thats the moon, back and forth i did this in confusion a few times...i tryed to wake up my brother and when i yelled his name no noise came out of my mouth so i tryed to scream louder and still no noise, so i pushed on him and he woke up and looked out the window and rolled over and went back to sleep. i looked in the middle windows at my parents and tryed to scream and i pounded with my fist, no noise came from my pounding, i thought i was going to break the glass but i could get no noise....... in a panic i felt nothing but fear and confusion. i looked in the windows and saw my parents looking like stiff figures, they didnt move or blink, eyes were glassy, stared straight ahead....i looked back out the side window and watched this moon shaped object and it hovered over the mountain tops following the truck, following the tree line, i could not guess how big it was in feet, but was as big as 3 full moons put together...brighter than the moon, and the real moon was up higher in the sky to the right.as i lay there watching i felt a very slight uplifting of the truck itself, maybe a inch off the ground, very subtle. i looked behind me and saw several beings, maybe 4 or 5..... all very small, 3 1\\2 feet tall to 4 feet tall..i could hear them talk to me but they didnt move their mouths. one i would guess was female said \"we will not hurt you\" the reason i say female as she looked like the rest her voice sounded like a female, i heard her in my head. she had a rubber looking tube like a hose wrapped in her hand and started rolling my little brother back and forth as to examine him. i tryed to push her away but i couldnt touch her...a slightly taller one got closer to me i tryed kicking him over and over and the more i got closer to him to kick i would always miss by inches, i cussed him, sreaming and kicking and punching.....never could i hit him. he also spoke in a male tone voice without moving his mouth, i could hear him in my head......i dont remember what he said but he didnt like the cuss words, seemed angery but had no emotions.........he put his hand over my mouth and layed on top of me to hold me down. he looked in my eyes with his eyes and i became paralized, i had flashes of my childhood in my head, fast flashes and flashes, i knew i had to fight, it was like he was sucking out memories and or searching my memories. i snapped out of it with him on me and i started fighting again... i fought for what seemed like hours...never could i reach my target to hurt it.........they all looked like what i would call a grey today..big almond eyes, looked like a televison screen turned off and black.......very skinny long, all wore black ribbed turtle neck outfit...gray in color, bubble looking big heads, slit for mouth, no ears, holes for nose, weak looking, mitts for hands. huge bulging blood veins on bubble head......i was hunkered in the corner, i feared for my life, nothing i could do, he came after me over and over, the others just watched.......i screamed for god to help me, he still came after me, i sreamed for jesus, again i screamed for jesus christ help me and they all popped like a bubble and they were gone.....the truck pulled over to the side of the road, my mom got out and opened the back of the topper and the day was beginning to break... my whole family remembers seeing something, i am the only one who remembers details......but all remember still to this day seeing something in the sky. i was exasted all day from the fight and lack of sleep and now i am 44 years of age and i still have never forgotten. i have not had experiences before or since and back in 1976 i had no idea of aliens or ufos. i am scared of these things, i always look to the sky when out at night and listen. i know it sounds crazy,but i always have my fight or flight sensors turned on when i look to the sky at night..its been approx. 32 years, im sure i have forgotten some, i dont remember exact words, i do remember the fear, the helplessness, the confussion... i have researched all avenues i can think of to explain to myself what i saw. my explaination to you would be that these things i saw were not of this world, not of a world known. i believe today they are demonic, fallen angels that fell with satan who are out to decieve the world with miraculious signs and wonders."],"Region":"Idaho","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
