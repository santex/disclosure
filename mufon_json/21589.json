I was looking at my photos on my computer and noticed a bright light and a dull object. I zoomed and I saw a bright light and a silver solid object. It's weird and I have the photos. I guess it could be the space station but I have seen it pass over my house and I don't think it looks like that. I am very interested to see what ya'll think of this photo. Please let me know what it is even if it's nothing. Not a weather balloon either because I looked that up and looks nothing like it. maybe a satalite, but I doubt that too.
