{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile house sitting at my sisters in Elmira Oregon, I was standing on here back pourch faceing east, cloud gazing when I noticed the sphere at about 1'o'clock apprearing just in front of a small slow moving (NxNW)thin cloud. It was brighter, or void of, the surrounding light blue sky. I went in side to get my camera. I noticed that the sphere had not moved from it's location after taking about 8 minutes to get my camera, but the cloud had passed on. I lined the spere up with a top to make sure it was not moving - it did not, for the entire duration of the viewing. It left my sight by slowly fading out. I was excited that it might be a planet visabl in broad daylight. I also noticed a shadow on it's backside facing away from the sun."],"Log Number":"US-02082011-0009","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.061589,+-123.084234(27725)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27725) map </A>","Date Submitted":"02/08/2011 10:14 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/01/2010 01:02 UTC","Longitude":"-123.084234","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27725.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27725_submitter_file1__IMG_2098.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27725_submitter_file2__IMG_2100.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27725_submitter_file3__IMG_2106.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27725.html"],"City":"Eugene","Case Number":"27725","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Oregon","Summary":"Noticed the sphere while looking at clouds - thought it was a planet - took several digital photos.","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Eugene","There were no other sightings in Eugene on or around August 1st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"44.061589"}
