{"divs":["sighting detailsit is only one of several sightings over the years many of which occured shortly after 9\\11, and more over the last 5 years. i truly believe there is a new area 51 like place in nc in or near rutherford county. i as well as my sister and brother n law and mom have all seen a solid white ball of light fly silently across the sky at dusk and at night. it is not a plane as there are no flashing lights. the entire object has a brilliant white glow to it. i have also seen 3 yellow light objects in the sky that were sitting perfectly still in the northwest sky, and fly off and disapper in seconds. i have seen (in the day time) an object which looks like a basketball flying around an airplane in the town of rutherfordton. i am willing to submit to any lie detector, hypnosis or any other test. if you came here, you would not have to stay longer than a month or maybe not that long before you would see something yourself."],"Case Number":"31416","City":"Forest City","Log Number":"US-09022011-0019","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-81.871704","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"09/02/2011 02:40 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/02/2011 04:30 UTC","Latitude":"35.329334","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.329334,+-81.871704(31416)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31416) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31416.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31416.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Solid White Ball Of Light","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"North Carolina","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Forest City","There were no other sightings in Forest City on or around September 2nd 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
