{"Longitude":"-112.064317","divs":["Sighting DetailsHere is a captured UFO from NJ taken a few years ago. Its very similar to the object in the AZ webcam. I have seen another picture somewhere even closer to this object but have yet to locate it. Unknowns don't have to be round in fact they come in many different shapes and sizes including looking like familiar items here on Earth and others are completely different to what we would think. I have many opinions but would rather keep them to myself. I will post that other photo when I find it. Thanks for comparing and looking."],"City":"Phoenix","Case Number":"8525","Date of the Event":"11/27/2007 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Similar UFO photo to the Phoenix webcam craft image.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-12012007-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8525.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8525_submitter_file1__birdlikeufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8525_submitter_file2__wt112707930am.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8525_submitter_file3__WT112707930amSMALL.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8525.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 9 other sightings in Phoenix on or around November 27th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/27/2007 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"33.453677","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arizona","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.453677,+-112.064317(8525)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8525) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO"}
