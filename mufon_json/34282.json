They made no sound & moved in perfect formation. 3 in a V and 2 off to the left. Moving West away from our area they seemed to climb in elevation & one by one disappeared from sight. It was a perfectly cloudless sky. The lights were much brighter & larger than the brightest star. We shot video for 2 min & during that time, an incoming airplane can be seen & heard in the frame. We called local police who arrived after the sighting, but confirmed other calls coming in from the area. We were very shaken, as we did not believe what we witnessed. It was extremely unsettling. We would like to submit our video, but cannot transfer it right now. Please let me know if you are interested in seeing it & we will get it onto our computer."],"Case Number":"34282","Date Submitted":"12/25/2011 12:26 UTC","Region":"New Jersey","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Dunellen","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Dunellen","Object Shape":"Oval"}
