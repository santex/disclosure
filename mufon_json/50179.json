{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting at campground friends walked back to their camper and called us to look up towards the east skyline. Waves of traveling lights unlike planes were moving in formation at a constant speed heading west. There were at times clusters of these lights traveling together. The just keep coming from the east. (If you look at a YouTube video called freaky lights huntersville nc they seemed To capture on video what we saw however at a different date) One light object glowed more brilliantly than the three it was clustered with and then glowed so intensely it started to \"melt\" like lava and the part that poured down created a secondary light that descended towards earth . It was the only one that I saw do that. What were these lights. I called 911 and then channel Fox News tv. Looking for an answer. Did anyone else see this besides the four of us?"],"Log Number":"US-08262013-0005","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Banner Elk","There were no other sightings in Banner Elk on or around August 24th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"08/24/2013 10:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"Wave of orange lights in groups traveling in sky approx over 100 over an hour","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/26/2013 09:37 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.125122","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Banner Elk","Case Number":"50179","Longitude":"-81.806609","Region":"North Carolina","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50179.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50179.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.125122,+-81.806609(50179)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50179) map </A>"}
