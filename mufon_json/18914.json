It was about 200-300 feet off the ground and flew directly over my house. I called my fiance out to verify I wasn't seeing things. I was in a state of panick, my fiance was hypntotized by the object. As I saw it fly over my house, I noticed it had rings on the bottom of it, they appeared red in color. It looked like a spaceship, and dull gray in color, like a warship. Nohing like the UFO's you normally see. It continued to fly past my house, and in a bright flash of light dissapeared from sight. From the other reports, it sounds as if it was making a travel from one airbase, to another, as I live close to Edwards Airforce base. Just thought I would share what I had seen.."],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/24/2009 04:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18914","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08272009-0007","City":"Pinon hills","Summary":"Huge airship rectangular, similiar to San Diego sightings","Latitude":"34.433237","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.433237,+-117.646792(18914)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18914) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18914.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18914.html"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/24/2009 04:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
