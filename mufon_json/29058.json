No actually craft was seen in the darkness. It came in toward our neighborhood, near the house, hovered silently, circled around silently and then dropped straight down at a very fast rate of speed. It then went away from our neighborhood toward the open space behind our house, where we lost sight of it over the neighbor houses. It wasn't a plane or a helicopter. My husband and I are in our eighties and we've seen many things in life. We aren't people that scare easily, but this definitely instilled a sense of fear, like we'd seen something out of the ordinary."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/10/2011 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"37.445663","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Palo Alto","Date Submitted":"08/08/2011 11:28 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Palo Alto","There were no other sightings in Palo Alto on or around May 10th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29058.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29058.html"]}
