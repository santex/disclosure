I usually look up at the sky at night to see the stars as I enjoy them very much.I looked up and saw an circular object heading south towards San Jose,CA. It was traveling soundless faster than the jetliners that pass over my complex on thier way to Oakland International Airport. My son and nephew saw the object and we were a little shaken if thats a good word for it. It was I would say the same altitude as the jetliners but headed in the other direction they usually take.It appeared to be a illuminated as a pale yellow light. I saw it a 2nd time this time 10 to 20 min later as I was going onto my mothers balcony. It was the same fast speed,a litttle higher altitude and this time going towards the area of niles canyon. It made us feel kinda scared . I was wjust wondering if there were other reports of this strange object. Well thank you for your time to whom it concerns"],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Union City","There were no other sightings in Union City on or around March 28th 2009"],"Region":"California","Summary":"I and my son and nephew saw an object moving soundless thru the night sky.","City":"Union City"}
