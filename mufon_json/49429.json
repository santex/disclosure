It was quiet until I couldn't sleep anymore and I looked at the clouds, there I saw these lights that were hovering and playing \"chase\" with each other and I thought I was hallucinating so with doubt I called on my parents. They saw what I did and we tried to capture it on the lphone camera but the background was too dark, since the light fuse of my room was out. It was sensational to be sharing my experience to others.
