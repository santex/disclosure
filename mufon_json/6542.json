you were right, you have informed all of us, that the planetary ships stuck here on earth have to leave, they can���t stay here forever, you were right.��� i worked for a telecommunications corporation, responsible for our us government and military communications, thanks to this job and because the corporation system had serious problems, i was sent to location i would never have been able to visit, let alone work on top secret sites\\locations\\systems. seven times, i was sent to nellis afb too resolve issues that no other department\\personnel could, several times this included area 51 and the 2nd valley (underground nuclear engineering\\scientists \\physicists) what i saw where alien grays that look just like 6��� 2��� strong humans with several exceptions: ���they are grey\\no hair and only wear special grey clothing, of course it���s a possibility they do wear something else but completely grey jumpers. humans can not work in the 2nd valley where nuclear underground testing takes place. i would love to tell all what i have seen���..maybe in person and after several alaskan amber beers. enjoy, hundreds of thousands are watching including the dod\\norad\\nasa. something is happening ��� extremely important ��� do our governments know about this? yes i���ve been watching a special location in the heavens for 30 years, (ufo universe freeway entrance\\portal) and have seen several hundred mother ships and planetary vehicles come and go. since august, something has changed. three (3) small red alien ships are controlling the entrance. i've not seen one alien mother ship come or go since this started. they move fast, they chase one another, they hold in place; this has been going for several weeks now. you don't require anything more than your own eyes. but you have to be in a dark location, you will not be able to see them if your in a city. if you can see the big dipper, look to the south around arcturus and watch between 9 pm and midnight. they are too dark and move to fast to record with any normal camera. i think they���re here for a reason. are they protecting our planet for some reason? if so - what? - why? they have to be security ships - very powerful and are controlling what alien civilizations visit our galaxy - what other reason could there be? i hope you can see the big dipper from your home. good luck, enjoy, this is exciting, but scary at the same time! the 3 ships spend time parked lined up with muphrid, then they travel through this area. ufo freeway entrance location left\\west of big dipper handle triangle location top star arcturus sao 100944 gsc 1472:1436, hip 69673, ppm 130442, hd 124897, b+19 2777 flamsteed-bayer: 16-alpha bootis bottom right star muphrid sao 100766 gsc 1470:1157, hip 67927, ppm 130166, hd 121370, b+19 2725 flamsteed-bayer: 8-eta bootis bottom left location cursor position ra: 14h 08m 37.5s dec: +13���32'47\" ra: 14h 08m 28.5s dec: +13���33'42��� (epoch 2000) azm: 281���40'53\" alt: +07���09'47\" rise: 06:46 transit: 13:34 set: 20:22 from muphrid: angular separation: 05���51'44\" position angle: +145���05' ************************************************************************************************************** arcturus[arktoor���us] pronunciation key, brightest star in the constellation bootes and 4th-brightest star in the entire sky; bayer designation alpha bootis; 1992 position r.a. 14h15.3m, dec. +19���13���. an orange giant of spectral class k2 iii, it has an apparent magnitude of -0.06; its diameter is about 10 times that of the sun and its luminosity about 100 times that of the sun. arcturus is one of the nearest giant stars, at a distance of about 36 light-years, and has one of the largest proper motions (annual angular shift in position) of the bright stars. its name is from the greek meaning \"guardian of the bear,\" and it can be found by following the extension of the curve of the handle of the big dipper (large bear). arcturus sao 100944 gsc 1472:1436, hip 69673, ppm 130442, hd 124897, b+19 2777 flamsteed-bayer: 16-alpha bootis spectral: k2iiip **** data from hipparcos catalog **** proper motion (mas\\yr): ra = -1093.45, dec = -1999.40 magnitudes bt: 1.629, vt: 0.286 parallax: 88.850 mas, 11.2549 pc distance: 36.71 light-years, 2321498.93 astronomical units magnitude: -0.05 ra: 14h 15m 51.416s dec: +19���09'44.637\" ra: 14h 15m 39.672s dec: +19���10'56.677\" (epoch 2000) azm: 299���49'24\" alt: -08���10'44\" rise: 06:53 transit: 13:50 set: 20:46 position error: 1.01 mas from sao 155312: angular separation: 75���53'45\" position angle: +66���23' muphrid sao 100766 gsc 1470:1157, hip 67927, ppm 130166, hd 121370, b+19 2725 flamsteed-bayer: 8-eta bootis spectral: g0iv **** data from hipparcos catalog **** proper motion (mas\\yr): ra = -60.95, dec = -358.10 magnitudes bt: 3.418, vt: 2.748 parallax: 88.170 mas, 11.3417 pc distance: 36.99 light-years, 2339403.21 astronomical units magnitude: 2.68 ra: 13h 54m 53.019s dec: +18���22'35.459\" ra: 13h 54m 41.079s dec: +18���23'51.781\" (epoch 2000) azm: 302���34'16\" alt: -12���24'59\" rise: 06:35 transit: 13:29 set: 20:22 position error: 1.17 mas from arcturus: angular separation: 05���01'34\" position angle: +261���52' you have my permission to show\\share\\copy\\print this information and provide it to anyone. the world needs to know what is taking place. i���ve called this location: ufo universe freeway entrance\\portal for 30 years. ted@fantasiaproductions.com command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance & reconnaissance\\emi\\rfi specialist prove me wrong! just try - move your telescope or request a telescope in the proper location that can see this area - to monitor it. then again, you don't require a telescope to see these red vehicles. since i have made the dod so mad, plus wasting eight years of my life! i have created new products\\systems\\homes\\rooms\\complexes\\flood homes\\security\\safety\\amber alert systems. www.newsafehomes.us"],"Latitude":"48.421216","Longitude":"-122.334047","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Mt Vernon","There were no other sightings in Mt Vernon on or around August 21st 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"08/21/2005 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"6542","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03102007-0008","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"www.we-are-not-alone.us","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Mt Vernon"}
