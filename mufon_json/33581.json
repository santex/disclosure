I pulled my car over to use my phone to video record the light, we watched it for about 1 minute until it faded out. I am not positive that it was moving when we first saw it, but it was stationary the entire time I recorded it. I do not know how to upload the video off my phone, but I will figure it out and submit it as aoon as possible."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"41.730757","Country":"United States"}
