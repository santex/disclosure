The incident happened in California while I was on vacation visiting my parents. I was walking on the beach in Oceanside, California, Sunday, September. It was around 4:45 pm. My then four year old son Garreth was with me. We were at the water's edge. The sun was starting to get closer to the horizon. I happened to look back towards the cliff area. I saw this oval object that was over the row of A-frame cottages, yet it was below the cliff line and other houses behind it. If you do a Google Earth search for the area where the flying object sat, it would be latitude: 33���11'53.93\"N and longitude:117���23'14.72\"W. Where I was standing on the water's edge was latitude: 33���11'55.62\"N and longitude:117���23'20.90\"W. What attracted me to the object was a glimmer of light as if reflecting the sun's light into a mirror and then moving the mirror so that it would pulse. Like using a mirror to send Morse code. We walked closer to the object walking away from the water's edge. The object did not move. The light coming from it did all the moving. I could see the color of the light which to make a basic description, looked like gold spray paint sprayed onto water and then sloshed so that the gold \"paint\" would circle around inside the oval shape. Gold spray paint has dark components in it especially if it is sprayed too thick ss this is as close to an example that I can offer. Imagine an oval tank filled with water, with underwater bright white lights inside the tank submerged and the thick gold \"paint\" material swirling around on top of the water as it won't mix with the water. There would be times when the \"paint\" was not too thick which allowed the light behind it to shine through making it brighter and darker as the \"paint\" material swirled around. The tank is on its side in this instance like a large picture frame. There was no pattern to the movement of the material inside the oval. Random swirls as if stirred with a large spoon and then reversed its direction at will. Very random. The object was the size of a large van. It was a windy day, there were seagulls flying a few yards from the object at palm tree level, and they were having a hard time negotiating the wind. The object was dead still. I at first thought it was a gag blimp or some type of kite. I looked for wires, there were none. Nothing short of billboard scaffolding could have suspended that large object over the cottage roofing to keep it from moving in the wind. There was no scaffolding. Nothing extended from the A-frame cottages and nothing connected to the houses on the cliff above the object. Still not wanting to believe this object was hanging there by itself, motionless, I moved closer. It was the same thing. No wires, no poles no metal trusses, not even an electric wire to supply power for the light effects. The object was facing the sun which was setting in a northwest position over the horizon. I moved closer to the object and noticed that behind the oval that was displaying the liquid light show, there was a turbine. Yes a turbine that spun counterclockwise. Looked like what you would see on a jet liner. There were light blue and pink lights coming out of the turbine as it spun. No specific light receptacles, just a flood of pastel colored lights coming out of the the area of the spinning vanes. But there was no noise at all. I could not understand how light could be coming out of the turbine as there were no bulbs, reflectors, etc. It was mystical to say the least. There were other people at the beach picnic tables across the cottages, gathered around, at about 10 feet away from where I stood, and I looked at them to see if they had noticed the object. They never glanced at it. Not even once as long as I stood there. Made me think, is this a gag, and everybody else has already seen it and grown tired of it? A young boy crossed in front of my son and me as we stood across the row of cottages and I looked at him to see if he was viewing what we saw trying to get him to look up at the object. He looked at me and wondered why I was looking at him. He never looked up at the object. My son and I looked at the object for a good 30 minutes, the sun was still brightly shining. I had to leave to get the car home in time for my parents to go to 5 p.m. religious services. I was late. Our car was parked on the street at the cliff line south of the cottages, quite a ways away from the Oceanside amphitheater and from where the object hung in the air. We started to head towards the car but I kept looking back at the object and it was still there in the same position. I reluctantly got into the car and drove home. I usually have a video camera with me. I'm a recording artist with music videos on MTV Asia. That day my brother had taken the video camera with him. Of all the times to be without a camera. And to think my rock video Garden of Eden that aired all over Asia on MTV Asia and Channel V from 1996 on, had famous pictures and video of \"ufos\" in it. I can still remember the object. I did not see any windows, any beings looking out, any doors, wings, tires. Above all no motion and no noise whatsoever. No smell of fuel, aviation or otherwise, no fumes, no exhaust heat mirages, no heat. The gulls were the loudest thing at the scene. The turbine was molded onto the oval light frame. If I had not stepped to one side I would not have noticed the turbine. It had dimension. It was a solid object. Whatever it was seemed to only be seen by myself and my son. This object was at rooftop of the one story cottages. The red cottages are still there on the beach access road at Oceanside beach, and can be seen on Google Earth. It was not a misty hazy apparition. It was well defined, unmistakably within close reach and in more than enough broad daylight to tell it was hanging there. It was definitely a flying machine. I have no idea where it came from. It had no letters, graphics, markings at all. I did not see it leave as I left before it did. I went back the next day and it was gone. I wish I had stayed till the object disappeared. I wish I had video footage of it. I wonder why it showed itself to me and not to the others on the beach. I have included a crude rendering of the object to at least give a visual of what we saw and in case someone else has seen this same object and reports or has reported it, for posterity. The side of the flashing \"blimp\" side is not exactly the way I saw it but the white and black and gold \"liquid\" lines are there to give an idea of what it was doing as it pulsed which was swirling in random waves. The color of the pulsing blimp was less intense as the rendering suggests and almost going towards a black and white version or as if the color had been dialed down to just a hint of color. The rendering is not really accurate. The turbine is as close as I could come up with using Infini_D in which I'm not really proficient. The overall look of the object is similar to as rendered. If I had access to a real artist, perhaps a closer picture of the object could be achieved. I'm wanting to fill in the portion of the blimp that connects to the turbine to give it a molded look as the blimp molds into the turbine.The turbine had a housing that extended to the rear as it sat alongside the blimp part of the object but I could not draw it into the rendering and would then be construed as a cigar shaped part as regards the turbine. Since the object As you can see this is an usual looking object. I wish I had thought to go around the rear of the object but I was pressed for time. If I have already reported this incident to your group, then here it is with a rendering.. With regards to the total number of witnesses it should read 7 to 10 people including my son and myslef but since I did not sense they were looking at the object I have to report two witnesses as myself and my son. I know it's strange but that's what happened that day while viewing the object."],"Weather Factors":"Windy, Medium","Country":"United States","Latitude":"36.787041","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Longitude":"-119.415722","Tags":"City"}
