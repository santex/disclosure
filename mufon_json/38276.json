I got up to see what he was barking at and saw 5 basketball size orange orbs floating in the back yard above the water and moving slowly from north to south. After they got out of range more followed, all in the same path moving slowly from north to south. I live in the outer banks of north carolina which is a small sandbar on the east coast. These objects were on the sound right behind my house. AFter around 20 minutes or so they stopped coming. A couple got really close and we could see what looked like spot lights slowly spinning and looking around down into the water and around the sky. I got kind of nervous at this but they didn't land or anything all all ended up disapearing to the south."],"Region":"North Carolina","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.766823,+-79.01297(38276)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38276) map </A>","Latitude":"35.766823"}
