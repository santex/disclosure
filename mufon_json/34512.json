They were very noticable, there was nothing else in the sky that bright. At first we were thinking they were airplanes but they were moving too slow, the lights were not blinking, and by how close they were together we knew they couldn't be airplanes. There were 2 on the top and one on the bottom. They were moving west plusating for about 10 minutes before they just dissapered."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Coral Springs","There were no other sightings in Coral Springs on or around December 31st 2011"],"Case Number":"34512","Log Number":"US-01012012-0057","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34512.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34512.html"]}
