Then this object began to move around. I got my video camera and filmed it for 5 minutes. The object is circular with a ring of light around the bottom. It is pulsing rapidly through all the colors of the rainbow. During the 5 minutes that I was filming it it did not move except at the end of the film when it drops behind the ridge pos back up and dips below the ridge again. Thus and movement in the film is from me adjusting the tripod, or zooming in and out. The object did move quite a lot, just not while I was filming. Enjoy the video for it is very real. I used to say \"I want to believe\" now I believe but \"I want to understand\" !!"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-106.285794","City":"Leadville","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/18/2010 10:30 UTC","Summary":"Colored bright disc over marsh behind my home!!","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.255563,+-106.285794(23876)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23876) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Leadville","There were no other sightings in Leadville on or around June 18th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Sighting Duration":"03:00:00","Region":"Colorado","Date Submitted":"06/21/2010 07:56 UTC","Latitude":"39.255563","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
