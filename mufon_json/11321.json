It was seen by many campers and was discussed by adults for a few days after and maw still talks of it and was quite disturbed by it all but..equally excited as she saved ufo clipping for years before.. my dad was flight sargeant in rcaf at the time.. trenton.. i unfortunately was in bed sound asleep..i ve heard this story so often i feel like i have seen it myself.. but didn't.. shes still here and can corroborate herself.. shes 82.. my sighting was in yukon territory about 100 miles down yukon river toward st michael Ak.. what thought were 2 satellites orbiting earth one lovely clear night.. aproached each other directly over head..not so unusual.. except that when there were almost ..seeming to crash into each other they each vered off at 90* angel to each other and carried on..so travelled 180* opposing away..didn't see them again ever..they were fast moving..faster than satellites..high..them not me..;-) dissappeared in the distance not the shadow of earth as satellites do..just struck off away from each other and disappeared into dark of space..satellites dissappear in shadow.. these kept going.. straight lines..dimmed and gone..to high to see shape just bright light.. satellite dissappear much sooner.. these went way off..straight lined and saw them for some time then just twinkled out..got smaller and smaller.. thats it..4 5 minute to vanish.. oh.. i saw 5 objects at cfb cold lake years later while at 42 radar squadron radar tower.. working for civil engineers.. was standing behind an operator.. when 5 objects come on screen.. operator asked officer in charge if he should clear the tower.. he said no.. we can deny later..truth i say..;-) well these 5 objects were tracked at 40000 mph.. cf 104's were scrambled and gave chase..when they were 5 miles from objects thats when they shot off in a blink.. gone...jets couldnt get close.. thats it too.. then they told us that if we speak of it they will simply deny it and hoped we realised how lucky we were to have witnessed this for our experience with the ufo thing.. that was around 1963..maybe 62..yes i was 15 when i went to work on the base..lived in pmq's with mother and father..he was then flight sargeant..senior nco snag and recovery..hangar 9 military nepotism..;-) cant recall ever seeing anything like that radar image..5 distinct objects.. in diamond formation.. all kept their formation..left in a blink in perfect harmony..they were triangular as well.. there was NO brevity on anyones part..the officer later said they cleared the tower of civilians when this happened as a rule.. we got lucky.. and i am very grateful to have wintessed this first hand..so.. all these years and i remember this some times..when i hear things like ufo's are figments..ha.. denial is alive and well on planet earth. peace.
