I saw a large Triangle shaped, maybe three stories high, Three rings of light one on each corner. at the bottom of the craft. It seemed to be glowing, or with an aura around it. No sound, and was traveling east. Like a blimp would fly, slow and steady. The craft was traveling in an arc, not a straight line. After about an hour, I saw it again, going the same way. about ten miles to the north. at the time I didn't have a camera or a video cam. all I could do was to get my family out to see it...They were not interested ! It made my adrenaline shoot up. It was huge ! My guess was that it was one of ours, Only not known to the public. as it was right over Travis AFB. I'm guessing again some kind of heavylift blimp thing. The craft flew past my line of sight, Two sightings in one night, I thought it was amazing !!"],"City":"Fairfield","Summary":"saw it hover over our town, on its way to travis afb, flying in an arc trajectory","Date Submitted":"10/15/2004 10:00 UTC","Longitude":"-122.031966","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"9444","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"10/15/2004 10:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
