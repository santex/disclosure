It looked like lights from a toy as they were strobing in different colors. At first I didn't think much of it but then I noticed that it rapidly changed its path from coming right towards me to the right (30 feet or so) I thought that it was turning but then it zagged the opposite direction shortly after that. It looked like it would zig..... hover..... zag..... hover.... zig It kept doing this over and over again. I realized that I was seeing something that I really didn't believe in. I tapped on my kitchen window to get my wife. She ran out and said... \"Its just a guy trying to learn how to fly\". I said no airplanes can zig and zag like that. She then said... GO GET THE CAMERA. I told her that I didn't know where it was. She ran in and got it as it went right over our house. I couldn't tell how far it was but somewhere between 500 to 1000 feet. It didn't make a peep. I KNEW that it was not a toy as it went diagonal over a residential neighborhood... No one with a remote could have kept up with it. I googled it a few hours later and to my amazement... NOT ONE WITNESS... Just me and my wife. This was with out a doubt an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. The object just kept zigging and zagging until we couldn't see it over the tree line in our back yard."],"Date of the Event":"08/12/2012 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"44.298902","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-88.39667","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Summary":"A zig zagging flying object with flashing lights on the tips of what seemed to ba a triangle shape","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.298902,+-88.39667(41722)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41722) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08132012-0030","Case Number":"41722","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41722.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41722.html"]}
