Saw about 7 (maybe 6) orange glowing orbs. No sound, nothing else, 4 in one group, 2-3 in the other group. One of them appeared to be moving even as I drove under them. They were a bit above treetop height but far too low to be planes (or appeared to be). I happened to see them as I was driving and just saw them ahead. At first I thought maybe they were some kind of lights strung up and quickly realized that wasn't the case. I just stared (and then had to turn my attention back to the road and then looked behind me), and wasn't particularly frightened just, oddly calm. I lost sight of them as I drove by, and they were not there when I went home about 2.5 hours later."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Raleigh","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-05262013-0006","Country":"United States","Latitude":"35.77959","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Raleigh","There were no other sightings in Raleigh on or around March 25th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"North Carolina"}
