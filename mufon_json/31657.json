{"divs":["Sighting Details I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ON HIGHWAY 60 HEADING SOUTH WHEN I SAW THE OBJECT OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE . I PULLED OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AT THE INTERSECTION OF HIGHWAY 60 AND FM521 AND QUICKLY TOOK TWO PICTURES OF IT . THEN THE OBJECT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR . I LOOKED AT MY PHNES CLOCK AND IT WAS EXACTLY 7:39 PM I PULLED BACK ONTO THE ROAD AND CONTINUED DOWN HIGHWAY 60 LOOKING AROUND BUT NOT SEEING ANYTHING . RIGHT WHEN I REACED C.R.242 I SPOTTED THE OBJECT AGAIN BUT IT DISAPPEARED BEFORE I COULD PULL OVER . I PROCEEDED HOME AND WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR I SEARCHED THE SKY BUT I SAW NO TRACE OF IT . I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO EXPORT THE TWO PHOTOS FROM MY PHONE TO MY E MAIL BUT IT WILL NOT WORK FOR SOME REASON . I WILL TRY TO CONTACT MY CARRIER TOMARROW AND RESOLVE THIS SO I CAN POST THE PHOTOS FOR YOU TO SEE ."],"Date Submitted":"09/08/2011 10:34 UTC","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31657.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31657.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Longitude":"-95.956226","Object Shape":"Egg","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-09082011-0024","Case Number":"31657","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Bay City","There were no other sightings in Bay City on or around September 8th 2011"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"I SAW IT AGAIN AND THIS TIME I GOT PICTURES","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.922298,+-95.956226(31657)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31657) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Bay City","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/08/2011 07:39 UTC","Latitude":"28.922298"}
