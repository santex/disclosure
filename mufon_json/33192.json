Most conspiracy theorists call these chemtrails. I was not expecting to catch anything. I just aimed at the \"X\" and lines and shot with my camera. I did not see anything with my naked eye. Upon inspection of the pictures later reveled what looks like a white aspirin circle to the left of the sun with a red-ish hew around it. If I were to take a guess, it is a UFO with some kind of force-field. I also caught some pictures with what looks to be orbs in them, but I am not sure why they would be caught within the same minutes. It could be nothing, but I thought it was worth sharing."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Huntington Beach","Sighting Duration":"08:11:00","Date of the Event":"11/03/2011 08:08 UTC","Latitude":"33.670097","Summary":"White circle shape with red dome (looked like a forcefield) to the Left of the sun","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-11072011-0010","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33192.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33192_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33192_submitter_file2__orb.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33192.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/07/2011 03:37 UTC","Case Number":"33192","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.670097,+-117.989466(33192)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33192) map </A>"}
