Than I noticed 2 lights moving about 200 yards away from each other way up in the sky. They were moving too slow to be a meteor cause I see them often. The light in the front started to dim out then almost simultaneously the light behind it went out as well. There were 2 different craft cause the one in the back was off set to the left of it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.87856,+-86.40368(35533)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35533) map </A>","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.87856","Region":"Tennessee","Date of the Event":"02/06/2012 06:33 UTC","Log Number":"US-02062012-0020"}
