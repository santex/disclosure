If I have the time I chase them to take pictures and videos. This specific day was no different than other hot and humid days where storms get predicted. At 7:15 pm I drove up Corliss Hill in Meredith NH and turned down Lindsey Court which is an empty cul-de-sac. Facing South I started video taking the storm over the tree tops while speaking to my husband on the speaker phone. At that time I did not realize what I had picked up until I viewed all the videos on July 21. Going frame-by-frame to capture lightning images something caught my eye on the video. It started on the left of the mid screen of the sky on the video; a dark grayish cylinder shape object flying at an angle towards the top of the video. Four frames were caught between the video length times of 00:3:17:13 ��� 00:3:17:16. Looking at the video at normal speed it went so fast anyone could have missed it. Frame by frame shows the cylinder object. I have tried debunking the object with no luck. All I can say is that it was no bird, bug, debris or plane. The only explanation I have is that I caught a UFO on my camera."],"Log Number":"US-07292012-0017","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown"}
