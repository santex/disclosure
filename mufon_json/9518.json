It happened on celebrated Memorial Day of 1977. I sat in the bed of my truck in a beach collapsable chair. I was watching airplanes go from West to East to get into the landing pattern at Stapleton Airport. The pattern started (West-East) at one end of the valley and ended at the other end valley where the mtns. got in the way. I saw one jet dissarear at the East end of the valley where I picked up a UFO flying at a very fast speed, it way grey and brown streaked (I couldn't tell if it was brown with grey streaks or brown with grey streaks). I watched for about 15 seconds go from one end of the valley to the other end on the valley. I figured the airplanes going 4 times slower than the UFO. The UFO made no noise, no sonic boom, no roar, nothing. I figured I would let my friend drive us back to Denver. I didn't tell anyone about this sighting for a couple of weeks."],"Date of the Event":"04/30/1977 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.076655,+-107.153937(9518)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9518) map </A>","Longitude":"-107.153937","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/30/1977 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.076655","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Case Number":"9518","Summary":"It flew over me at 1,200 to 1,500 MPH.
