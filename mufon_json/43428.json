However, I did see a bright light, which looked very much like the surrounding stars, appear near the top of Orion's leg (the three stars on the left bottom). It moved more slowly than any meteors I have seen, but it still moved at a good pace, down the three stars of the leg, and into the southern sky. I watched for about ten seconds as it followed a straight path, then it was obscured by the surrounding trees. I thought it was possibly a plane, but it seemed to be moving too fast across the sky. I thought it could be a meteor, but it seemed to be moving too slow across the sky, stayed the same brightness all the time (never seemed to burn out)and it had no tail. It just looked like a star, traveling in a straight line, at a moderate speed."]}
