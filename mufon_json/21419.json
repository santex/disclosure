I thought it was the ISS, but from the reports ISS is not in this orbit area??? Please somebody debunk this for me?? This thing was huge! I saw a plane going the opposite direction and it was just a dot compared to this. Also it lasted about 2 minutes then quickly faded out. I have seen the ISS before and it was sort of in the same orbit, but did not fade out like this thing did! Also, it looked like a smaller object left from it in the west direction, but could have been a small satellite coincidently passing at the same time....would like to verify that!"],"Date Submitted":"01/09/2010 09:50 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.067083,+-121.31425(21419)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21419) map </A>","Country":"United States","City":"Bend","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21419.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21419.html"],"Summary":"Large Orange Bright light..I thought it was ISS (ISS is not in this location)","Case Number":"21419","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-121.31425","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
