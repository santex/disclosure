I snapped picture twice since the first time was blurry of the ship, so snapped a second one immediately within a sec as I know my camera is the way to get a clear picture. Noticed that in that 1 second window the 4 lights moved in a split second.. although I saw them, I thought nothing of them at the time, but now I dont know. Wish to submit pictures for report."],"City":"San Juan","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Was trying to get a good night picture of my cruise ship and caught my eye","Case Number":"12486","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/09/2008 08:07 UTC","Country":"Puerto Rico","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in San Juan","There were no other sightings in San Juan on or around September 9th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
