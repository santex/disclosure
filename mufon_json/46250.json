Heading towards Deming Park. I noticed the object directly ahead of me in my field of vision above Deming Park, It was a Black object and it appeared to be diamond like or triangular in shape. When I first saw the object I thought it was a kite, I stopped in Deming Park to watch the object, It was black and I noticed it rotating because one side would flash in the sunlight. The object was travelling in a straight path through the sky, over the tree line and houses. I got back in my vehicle to track the object, By the time I had started driving I lost sight of the object. P.S. I took the photos with my IPhone camera, unfortunatelly it is all I had."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Pittsfield","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Pittsfield","There were no other sightings in Pittsfield on or around March 17th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"03/17/2013 02:10 UTC"}
