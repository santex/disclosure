sightings i've seen. i will report on the current one first because i have times and dates that might be confirmed by someone else. the other two were a long time ago, but are indented in my mind because i've pondered each incident many many times. the most current incident took place while flying from seattle to palm springs on alaska air, flight 478l. the flight left seattle at approx. 3:15pm on oct. 4th 2007. i was sitting in row 16 at a window seat on the left side of the plane. we were over a mountain range or higher plateau area, approx. 5:00pm. down the side of the mountain range and into the desert valley, i was looking down at what i first thought were three large oil or water storage tanks. i remember saying to myself, wow, those are really large tanks, and, i wonder why they're sitting out in the desert all by themselves. they were silvery\\gray in color, and appeared to be round in shape. as i continued to stare down on the three objects, they began to move very slowly. this startled me, and i began to wonder if they were land vehicles, but at the same time, what land vehicle is round, and second, there was no evidence of any roads. i also questioned myself as to, would i be able to see a land vehicle at the altitude we were at. two of the objects moved in one direction maintaining the same distance apart as they were when stationary. the third object moved away from the other two in the opposite direction, again very slowly. all three objects suddenly stopped moving and remained stationary. the third object, which had moved in the opposite direction, suddenly moved back towards the other two and went between and past the other two, which remained stationary. the single object then stopped slightly past the other two. all three objects were now statinary again. now i was freaked out to say the least. unfortunatly the wing of the aircraft now blocked my view and i was unable to observe the objects from then on. the next two sightings i would like to describe took place at separate times. i don't have dates or even the exact year because i didn't write it down at the time unfortunately. i think it was 1985-88. some buddies and myself had made arrangements with a flight company in seattle called bob & pat's fun flights. they had some kind of connection to a reno gambling casino where they would fly you there and back, a one day trip for free. the hook was, you had to bring a minimum of $300 in cash, and you had to say and gamble in their establishment only. if i remember correctly this casino was not in main downtown reno. it was fairly close to the airport because they bused us in to the casino fairly quickly. we were scheduled to leave reno around 6-7pm. a sudden storm had come in and it started snowing around 3-4pm. this delayed our flight and we didn't leave until around midnight. in those days i was known as what was called a \"white knuckle\" flyer. grab the arms of the seat and hang on tight. at any rate, i couldn't close my eyes or sleep. since this was a chartered flight, and free no less, it had no ammenities. i'm not sure, but i think they had maybe two attendants, no food or beverage service and after we took off all of the lights in the plane were turned out. i don't remember any overhead lighting being on and most, if not all, of the passangers were asleep. we had been in the air for some time and being the \"white knuckle\" flyer i was, i stared out the window into the darkness trying to pick out any light i could find on the ground. probably to assure myself we were still in the air and not about to crash. so here i was, picking out of the darkness little pockets of light that i assumed were little tiny towns tucked away somewhere, watching the light disapear behind us as we flew on. it seemed to be a long stretch without seeing anything when suddenly a round circle of light appeared on the ground below. when i say suddenly i mean like turning on a light bulb. i was staring into the darkness and bang, there's a circle of light like you would see on a performer on stage. the light was very intense, very bright and the diameter of the circle i guessed to be several hundred feet. being from seattle i would guess it was as big in diameter as the king dome if not bigger. now i am trying to determine where the light is coming from. i can't see anything below us that is projecting the light, like a helicopter. the area that is being inluminated appears to forested. the light source is moving very slowly because you can see tree tops moving into the light on one side and disapearing on the other. i also see a speck of what i think was a farm house and barn. i don't know what our altitude was at this time, but we could have descended from what would have been normal cruising altitude. suddenly the light goes out and i am again staring into the dark. no more than maybe 3-5 seconds the light is back on. it remained on for the second time for about 5 seconds and with a blink......off again. now i,m starting to freak out. i'm staring out into the dark, back into the aircraft to see if anyone else is awake, back into the dark..........when suddenly three very very tiny lights appear from the top of the window and drop stright down to the center of the window and stop. i damn near loaded my pants, if you know what i mean. i'm sure my heart stopped for a moment. as i stared at the lights, there was no movement and i at this point assumed this object was the source of my circle of light. i had seen, heard and read about ufo's and alien abductions and was sure at this very moment we were about to be a statistic. report: aircraft disapears in the mountains between reno and seattle. the three lights that i am now staring at, the two on outside, appeared to be 1\\4\" to 1\\2\" apart with the third slightly highter between the two outer lights. the scale of measurement i'm using is in relation to the scale of the airplane window. because i'm partially color blind, i think it's refered to as being red\\green color deficient, i could'nt tell what the colors of the lights were. i do know that the two on the outside had a stronger and equal intensity than the one in the middle. this lead me to later think that possibly the center light was a different color. so just as i'm now thinking we're about to be swollowed up by a gigantic ufo, the three lights appear to come together as one and then gone. my deduction on this was that the ufo went away from us at a very high speed, thus the lights appearing to come together were actually going away. in conclusion to this story, we landed, i went home, i didn't report the sighting or even tell any one the story for some years. i guess it's the thought of someone looking at you like a nut case and the snickers you get from the skeptics, like you don't really believe that s--t do you? i listened to the news and read the papers for days after hoping to see or hear of a sighting, but i didn't. this now leads me to the third and final sighting what occured sometime between 1976-78. i think it was about this time period because my two children were with me at the time. i remember they were jumping around in the back of my volkswagon bus. i had made the back kind of large play pen so the kids wouldn't get bored on long trips we made camping or to other places. i had taken the second seat and turned it around to face the third seat and then put in a piece of plywood covered it with a big piece of foam mattress. my two kids, would have been 3-4 and the other 6-7 at the time. we were in lynnwood, wa. traveling east on 196th, approching the i-5 overpass leading to our home. it had been a very stormy day with what i perceived as very unusual cloud formations, stormy, rainy, and lightning that didn't appear to hit the ground but light up the clouds at various locations. it was very strange to me because i have lived in the seattle area my entire life and never had seen this peticular activity before. it was approximiatly 2-3pm in the afternoon. as we approched the overpass i saw ahead of me, maybe a 1\\2 mile, what appeared to look like a ferris wheel on the horizon. it was a large circle with lite up spokes extending from the center, to the outside circle, which was lit up the same as the spokes. the diameter of the circle was approximately 200-300'. the light or lights were independent of each other, evenly spaced. i'm not sure of the colors, because as i stated in the other sighting, i have a red\\green color deficiency. they did however appear to have different intensities. the object turned very slowly, like a ferris wheel would, but also moved in a horzional motion, like a wheel rolling on a horzional surface, again very slowly. because we were on the overpass, which was higher than anything around us i could see about 3\\4 of the object behind the small hillside in front of us. as we decended down the other side of the over pass, and the road also declined, the hill side in front of the object eventually blocked its view. i was approximatly a 1\\2 mile from the object and spead up to get to the top of the hill and hopefully see what i thought was to be a ufo up close. again, unfortunately, when i got to the top of the hill the object was no where to be seen. this concludes my story of three sighting. i hope they can be used and helpful in your quest for the truth. sincerely, steve"]}
