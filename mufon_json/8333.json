As the object came closer I notice a plane quite a bit behind the object, and that was where the noise was comming from, as the orange object came closer it looked like a pill then a egg it was more narrow and almost transparent, it was darker towards the middle of the object and bright orange at the top and bottom and I could not hear any noise from the object. I belive the time was about 6pm, not quite sure and it just headed South-west. The plane was not following it.That was about 15 to 25 secounds and the object was gone."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"37.647597","Date of the Event":"11/09/2007 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/09/2007 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Egg","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Modesto","There was one other sighting in Modesto on or around November 9th 2007"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Object moving from North to south orange in color almost trasparent no noise","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.647597,+-120.989468(8333)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8333) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8333.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8333.html"]}
