It had round lights at each corner which were alternating between red and white. I did not get a very good look as I was viewing it through some trees. After about four minutes it left. Note that this is very similar to sightings in WV and Ohio that happened within a few days of each other."],"Summary":"Dark triangle with round lights at corners.","Source":"MUFON","trends":[],"Tags":"City","Region":"West Virginia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19312.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19312.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.599366,+-80.448363(19312)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19312) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
