It was a somewhat chilly night for July. We were in the grass next to the lake and a playground. 7 of us in my family saw a bright orange fireball moving across the sky from the south to the north about 3-5000 feet above the ground. There was a lighter foggy border around it but all you could really see was fire underneath the object, which was unseen due to the dark night sky. It was about the size of Mars when it's closest to the Earth. The object was seen for about 10-12 minutes and then went behind a cluster of trees and wasn't seen again. We discussed a hot air balloon, an airplane and a blimp as answers, but none of them seemed to be the right fit for a description of the object we saw."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24355.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24355.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Rockaway Beach","There was one other sighting in Rockaway Beach on or around July 4th 2010"],"Date Submitted":"07/08/2010 12:53 UTC","Summary":"An orange fireball slowly moved across the night sky and then disappeared.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-07082010-0013","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"36.699228","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Region":"Missouri","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-93.159902","Case Number":"24355","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Rockaway Beach","Object Shape":"Fireball","Country":"United States"}
