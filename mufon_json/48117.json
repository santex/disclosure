{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was a passenger in my boyfriend's car driving along Waterworks Road from the north towards Red Hill when he noticed a strange glowing object in the sky. I looked and immediately noticed that it was something weird- it didn't appear to be a plane or helicoper, although it looked like it was flying at low helicopter altitude. It was pulsing with bright orange light (no flashing lights like you'd see on an aircraft). And appeared orb shaped. We attempted to follow it, and as we turned off the main road onto Windsor rd then down Victoria street, it changed direction so that it was ahead of us. We pulled over to the side of the road and then watched as it appeared to gain altitude until it disappeared. I definitely got an otherworldly vibe from it! This was no ordinary aircraft."],"Case Number":"48117","Log Number":"AU-06142013-0002","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Red Hill","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright orange pulsing orb viewed over Red Hill Brisbane","Date Submitted":"06/14/2013 06:11 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48117.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48117.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"-27.454914","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Queensland","City":"Red Hill","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-27.454914,+153.00713(48117)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48117) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"Australia","Longitude":"153.00713","Date of the Event":"06/14/2013 06:50 UTC","Tags":"City"}
