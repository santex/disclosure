I did not see it again. It appeared to be moving but there was no aircraft or helicopter sounds. I tried to plot in my mind where it may have gone and searched the sky for about 10 minutes but I did not see it reappear. I thought it may have gone over a cloud. The sky was pretty clear and you could see many stars. This is why I was looking up , to see the stars. I easily noticed the object because it was so out of place, blue and white and the biggest object in the sky. At first, I thought it was a helicopter turning on a searchlight, but it did not shine down or anywhere, it was just in one spot, glowing. The object seemed to be moving slowly foreward with a blue and white light,I think blue surrounded by white. What in the heck was that? Am I seeing things, going nuts or what? I figured that I should report it to see if anyone else saw it and to help with your research. I lost the object because it did not appear anymore."],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Case Number":"10905","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Blue and white light.","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"39.909416","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Uniontown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.909416,+-79.709183(10905)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10905) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
