We were looking skyward and saw a triangle (equilateral) craft moving from SE to NE and we lost sight after it passed the houses nearby. We had low cieling clouds at about 8000 to 9000 ft. We could see the outline of the craft against the clouds because the city lights illuminated the clouds. The craft was black, if there were no clouds one could not see the shape. It also had a large golden light in the middle with 2 smaller gold colored lights toward the rear. There was no sound no red or green navigation lights and no navigation strobe. I estimated the speed from when I used to watch jets land at San Francisco airport. Thier approach speed was about 250 knots. That night I could not sleep after seeing it. I am retired from Lockheed and worked on a lot of classified projects and never saw anything like that."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There was one other sighting in Grand Rapids on or around July 4th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.96522,+-85.665126(24725)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24725) map </A>","Case Number":"24725"}
