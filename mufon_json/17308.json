{"Date of the Event":"05/25/2009 02:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-112.00665","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsi would like to first state that this is probably my 50th sighting in a month...for some unseen reason i am lucky enough to watch these events unfold in front of me...perhaps its just my great view of the mountains and city of phoenix - or perhaps just that i give them the attention they want. my first sighting of this type of object was may 8th i saw one pulsing brightly over the city...but that is a different even may 9th the object was back...ma 10th it was back the 11th it was back all the way through to the 17th...the skys where stormy and overcast for 2 days...i saw no ufos ...no brightly pulsing lights...may 17th 18th and 19th i thaught what i had filmed and doccumented for 10days was just stars in space...outside our atmosphere...i had lost hope and felt depressed. but then may 20th...there it was low over the city - the skys where still overcast and it was raining no stars where visible and this object was glowing like the fricken moon throwing off colors in a mist like aura around it. i told you this to somewhat bring you up to speed on whats happened since my may 9th report. the other most signifigant and doccumented sighting happened not to long ago on may 25th 2am - 4am{could have been longer i fell asleep} at 2 am i observed a bright shining object on the eastern horizon it was low on the horizon and moving tremendously slowly. i watched it through my camera and binoculars and noticed it had no blinking lights ...and to me seemed like an immensley bright star...i dismised it as being nothing...but subconsiouslly some part of me knew it was no star it was far to bright and it didnt register on my skymap program...i went about my bussines for about 45 minutes to an hour at 245 - 3 am i looked back at it what was before a bright yellow\\white light was now the same exact object i had been filming for weeks...this made me pretty excited i grabed my camera to zoom in on it - sure enough it was just like the other objects bright colorful and pulsing red blue green i watched it for some time filming and after a few short minutes i noticed a bright red pulse - {the light itself probably doubled in size and turned solidly red} i zoomed in more intensly and watched somthing i had never seen before - unlike all the other times ive withnessed these colored flashes this pulse kept going! i would see it pulse bright blue and then bright red i would count and every 15-20 secconds it would pulse blue than red...in that order ...every time.... these lights have intelligent pattern...and i filmed it for 2 minutes... but that isnt the amazing thing about my may 25th sighting. after filming for a while i noticed i only had about 10 minutes left to film...the object seemed like it was getting closer slowly and i wanted to save room. in case i was lucky enough to have it pass right over me...i smoked a cigarrete and just watched it for a while...i felt myself conected to this light...i had been up all night the previous night and i was exausted but i could not sleep...not while this lights in the sky...i felted tied to it for as long as i could see it . after about an hour of smoking cigarettes and wondering what this light was i decided to zoom back in on it { it seemed to be getting closer } what i saw when i filmed this object took my breath away...well not really it made me gasp and say oh my god...in a good way...when i zoom in to about 20x optical zoom it appear as not a solid sphere of light but a broken sphere the top 1\\3 of the object was not glowing it was solid...the bottom orb was glowing immensely ...when i zoomed in to 30x or even further to 60x what i saw was amazing the top solid part of the orb vanished..the orb was still cut off,missing its top...but there was no longer a visible solid object - it just dimmed out of focus...the more amazing thing is what was going on in the bottom glowing orb i could clearly see in my viewfinder a glowing core of light with red and blue lines of light swimming around it ...it was amazing looking into it i felt the most overwhelming feeling of serene calmness , connectedness , spiritualness , i believe the reason it appeared as 3 different objects at 3 different times was because its lights appearance changes deppending on the distance... i had observed 2 of this lights stages before just not in one instance...the latest stage when the object seemed its brightest and biggest was at about 3 - 4 am. here is my exact log entry (i keep a journal to doccument these events) \"may 25th,2009 aprox. 2am yellow orb observed and filmed . on eastern horizon - noticed pulsating light on western horizon same as previous ufos.noted siris's speed relative to western ufo\" {siris is a major star constilation} \"aprox. 2 30am yellow orb began to pulse similiar to the other ufos and for the first time i filmed 20+ red and blue pulses and with intelligent pattern there would be a blue and then a red pulse every 15-20secconds this object is amazing to me may25th a day i will never forget\" \"aprox 3-4am - the object now appears as the 2 toned upside down saucer with an orb coming out the bottom side, the bottom orb has a bright glowing core with red blue lights dancing around it. filmed object in all 3 stages and or distances went from yellow orb to pulsating orb to 2toned laser show like orb\" also noted after rewatching my footage there is a moment right before i adjust my cameras view, immediatly after i had been thinking god i wish i could communicate {thaughts along those lines} well right after those thaughts right before i adjust my camera there is an unexplainable noise i did not hear it with my ears it is a quiet sound but my camera does not capture sound very well...it wouldnt hear anything i cant, it barely picks up my voice from 1 foot away this noise is earie and otherworldly to say the least im including a short clip of my footage...the same clip i posted on the internet ...there is only one point where my footage is edited i used my camera software to sharpen the image and turned contrast down to eliminate glare - now those settings would not create any kind of illusion i editted it in such a way because the lines of light are to fine to appear on a computer screen {thats what i think at least} you will see in my footage this object is real and i edited it so that you could see what my eyes saw from the luxery of your own home...the noise is in this clip twords the end i suggest getting really close to your speakers or turning the volume up it is a faint noise...i hope dominique gets to read and see this i talked to him about it briefly on the phone plz assign this report to him or somthing =}..."],"City":"Phoenix","Summary":"Changing light south of Usery Mountain Range 25th of May 2009--filmed.","Latitude":"33.588859","Region":"Arizona","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet -
