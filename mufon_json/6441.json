{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAria: Near Downtown Oshawa. The light looked bigger than Saturn and it was coming from the West. I went to my parents house then came back to see that it was still there 15 degrees from the hurizen. I went in the house and walked out with the camera without putting my coat on. I was shaking because I was getting cold and I couln't take a good \"still\" still. I was afraid I was going to loose it. The camera I was had options for taking different kinds of pictures but I couldn't get a picture of what I was seeing. I did however took some typical UFO pictures of this object in the sky but honestly it wasn't what I saw. The video clip I took was closest to what I saw."],"Summary":"I saw many UFO's before but this one was so slow I had time to get a camera","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6441.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6441_submitter_file1__Picture045.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6441_submitter_file2__Picture046.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6441.html"],"Region":"Ontario","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Oshawa","There were no other sightings in Oshawa on or around February 10th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"6441","Date Submitted":"02/10/2007 07:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"CA-02222007-0006","Latitude":"43.89","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Saturn-like, Sphere, Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"02/10/2007 07:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.89,+-78.86(6441)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6441) map </A>","Longitude":"-78.86","City":"Oshawa","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
