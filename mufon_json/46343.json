Off to his Left, out the window I could see 5 'disc's\" looked orange, like I have heard fireballs described. They were moving from North to South very slowly and one by one would disappear. We drove to the corner of Hidden valley road and 291 highway at the Vet's office and saw 2 more of these coming from the North. They 'staggered' and didn't seem to have any exact time as to when the next one appeared. We saw the first 5, then 2 then 1 several times. I tried to get a picture but they were to far away. Bigger than the stars I was looking at. Ea one would kinda start after the other ones 'disappeared' We watched for about 45 minutes and decided to see if we could tell where they started from but then they stopped. (they did not 'shoot' into the sky... they just 'appeared'... it was weird"],"Summary":"saw 5 'fireballs' in the sky at one time'--then one by one they disappeared","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.097576","Case Number":"46343","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46343.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46343.html"],"City":"Independence","Date of the Event":"03/20/2013 09:15 UTC"}
