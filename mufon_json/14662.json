I couldn't believe what I saw there was a bright white object over my head in the sky. It looked like a spinning star. So I had to go get out my night-vision goggles. There were two shapes that were just spinning around each other real fast. I couldn't make them out with all the colors from it. It kept going but didn't move anywherer and I just sat there and smoked and watched it and i could not for the life of me figure out what I was seeing. So then, all this color and light sparks starts shootimg off of it and the next thing i know the dam neighbors start shooting their guns at it. It exploded in a rainbow burst of color that shot out all over the sky when I realized, oh my God it was midnight on New Years. The guns kept going off and people were yelling and i didn't know if they were yelling at the craft I saw or just because it was New Years. What a way to bring in the new year. I'll never forget this new years as long as i live, and that's the god's honest truth."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Case Number":"14662","Log Number":"US-01012009-0008","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14662.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14662.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/31/2008 11:30 UTC","Region":"California","Summary":"Saw a UFO people trying to shoot it down.","Country":"United States","City":"Mojave","Latitude":"35.06138","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Mojave","There were no other sightings in Mojave on or around December 31st 2008"],"Object Features":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-118.166724"}
