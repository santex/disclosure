we spoke to no one about it. i called you to make this report in an effort to see if anyone else has reported anything similar but i don't want any publicity and don't want to talk to anyone else. the whole thing has me a little scared. note: we have seen balls of light in this area before, and have seen unidentified objects, but nothing as close or as dramatic as this. my parents and grandparents owned this same land for many years, and they said that all kinds of weird stuff happened here but they did not talk about it much. my mom and dad saw a ufo over clearwater lake in the early 1970's. i remember that my grandfather talked about some missing time and seeing a red fireball back in the 1940's, and that my parents always checked and locked all the doors and windows in the house at night, even during summer when it was cool enough to leave the windows open. they didn't talk about it much but now that i think about it that was pretty strange, since we are far away from any other houses out here."],"Region":"Missouri","City":"Piedmont","Latitude":"37.159185","Longitude":"-90.686585","Date Submitted":"05/26/2013 05:56 UTC","Log Number":"US-05262013-0016","Summary":"Large orange/red glowing ball, missing time, and humanoid entity sighting with questioning by police the next day","Date of the Event":"05/24/2013 11:10 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
