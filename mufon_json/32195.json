The object was moving at a slow rate of speed. I pulled over to the side of the road in order to get a better look at it and was upset that I did not have a camera or video camera with me. It moved slowly overhead and towards the west - towards Kansas. It went out of sight again at the tree line. It was the size of my thumb at arm's length. The object was an orange color and pulsated. I did not hear any sound as it went over. A plane came over at approximately the same height moments later and I could hear it clearly. I've never seen anything like this and wonder if anyone else saw this object."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Kansas City","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"09/29/2011 06:38 UTC","Region":"Missouri","Log Number":"US-09292011-0025","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-94.569277"}
