Something told her to take a pic with her camera phone. She sent me this picture, which I felt was a beautiful day light shot. She didn't see the object at the top until I sent her a message back telling her to not send me a Photo-Chop picture. I forgot that she doesn���t own a computer, so she can't fake this pic that I know of. Please take a look at this pic for me, if it's a sun blot thru the lens let me know that to. Also notice how the object cast a ring thru the sun. No sun blot does that, I���ve tried to prove to myself that this pic is a fake. But I can't prove that because even under magnification you can't see the sky thru the object."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Hammond","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Indiana","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
