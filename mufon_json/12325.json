{"Object Features":"None","Summary":"A shiny silver cylinder object moving south to north approx.","City":"Manor","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Manor","This sighting has never been favorited."],"divs":["sighting detailsi was in my yard in manor, pa looking at the clouds in the evening of i believe august 23, 2008, somewhere around 7 pm (it could have been a little earlier or later, but quite a bit before sunset). i was observing clouds and contrails from the jets in the sky, looking toward the east. i noticed a silver cylinder type object moving along under the level of the sparse clouds in the upper eastern sky. it was moving at a reasonable speed that i would expect a jet to fly, going from approximately south to north-northeast. the length of the object would be about the width of the tip of my little finger when held at arms length to the sky (about a 1\\2 inch or so), and it's heigth was about a little less than half of it's length - rectangular like - with i believe blunt, not tapered, ends. i thought it should be an airplane or jet but i kept looking at it and could not notice any wings at all protruding from it. it did not leave any contrail which isn't unusual. but as i kept looking at it, i felt that it wasn't flying extremely high so i should have been able to see some shape of wings. i recalled seeing jets that looked even smaller and higher in the sky and i was able to make out their form, but on this i could only see a cylinder shape. it appeared to be a silver cylinder and was reflecting the light of the sun (which was behind me and low in the sky) with no apparant lights of its own. i thought that if a jet were banking or something that maybe i wouldn't see the wings, but it was flying a straight line across the sky. it crossed my mind that maybe it could be a blimp type object but i don't have any comparison to make because i never saw a blimp flying that high in the sky and looking solid silver. i didn't see any sign of windows, or lights but at that distance, i might not have been able to see them even if there were some. i watched it until i could no longer see it because of my house and trees. i look at the sky a lot in the day and night, observing clouds and stars. i have never seen this type of object and if there is a good explanation for this, i'd like to hear it. i mentioned it to my husband who wasn't really interested, and when i read the sunday paper article about ufo's being tracted from a local neighborhood (jeannette), i thought i'd report what i saw and maybe get an explanation. i was so fascinated with watching it, i didn't think to get a picture, which i truly regret."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12325.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12325.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/23/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09022008-0018","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/23/2008 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.333958","Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"12325","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-79.670043","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.333958,+-79.670043(12325)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12325) map </A>"}
