Bright moon light without any clouds in the sky. I could clearly see the difference between objects & planes that were also flying in the sky. 3 of the red lights were in triangle shape, other 2 red lights were above in a straight line (kinda looking like the big dipper). I called my boyfriend at home & told him to go outside and look at what I'm seeing. When I first noticed the objects, I completely stopped my car & starred at the sky trying to figure out what I was observing. When I finally reached home, my boyfriend was outside. Once he saw what I was talking about ... he ran inside to grab his phone to video tape the sky. By the time he came back outside...all 5 lights had disappeared."],"Latitude":"42.309764","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Canton","There were no other sightings in Canton on or around September 30th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10012012-0006","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Canton","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Five bright Red flickering lights- moving slowly in a similar shape of big dipper star formation- all sudden disappeared after 15 minutes","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Date of the Event":"09/30/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-83.472616","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42949.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42949.html"],"Tags":"City"}
