They were about 2-3 ft in diameter as I got closer about half a block away I slowed my truck down to about 3-5mph until I was within 20ft or so it was just off the road. I stopped for 1minute or so,the lights were so bright I had to shield my eyes they were brighter then any lights I have seen in my life time., I knew that nothing could be this low and stationary, I was nervous and scared so I proceeded to work, I have never seen any thing like that in the 16 years I have drove down this road. I could not believe what I saw that morning and it still remains with me today."]}
