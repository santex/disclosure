I was looking up in the sky and saw a flashing light, that had red and green lines protruding from it. We both thought it was maybe our eyes messing with us, though we knew it wasn't a plane. Well, last night, I was outside around midnight, maybe a few minutes after, before I went to bed. I saw the same exact thing, though this time I could see there was movement. The lines would protrude, and then it was gone. I thought maybe it was covered up by clouds. Within a split second, it appeared, and moved in a zig zag line, and stopped. It wasn't a lot of movement, but it was very noticeable. The lights went out again. They reappeared, and the object seemed to move a bit closer towards me, and then shot back a bit. Again, the lights went out, and reappeared and started moved in a small circle. I was pretty tired, so I decided to go inside and go to bed. Knowing that I saw this same thing twice now this week, and I know of no aircraft that hover, I found this to be interesting."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
