We walked one block north of my condo to an open field. I started to look up into the west sky and saw a sphere like object emitting light. the object moved from west to east over our location The object was very bright from all sides. The object was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air.The object appeared to be emitting a glowing smoke or cloudy mist. It looked to be about 10 ft. in diameter. We stood there in amazement and watched the object pass over. It took about 3 to 5 min. to move across the sky from west to east and then it disappeared. The object made no sound at all. The feelings we both had during the sighting was amazed and emotional."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-88.786228","Date of the Event":"09/11/2009 07:57 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.79349,+-88.786228(19294)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19294) map </A>","Summary":"Sphere emitting bright star like light","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/13/2009 01:17 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":[],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Wisconsin","Case Number":"19294","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Log Number":"US-09132009-0012","Source":"MUFON"}
