{"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Sharon","There were no other sightings in Sharon on or around August 6th 2010"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsA year back me and my daughter were dropping my mother off at her elderly home. There is a round driveway and we dropped off my mother and as we were rounding the driveway we saw something overhead and stopped. An extremely large, low flying aircraft flew over the top of the adjacent building and then took a sudden turn and took off so quickly it disappeared in just a second. The shape of the aircraft was triangular with one of the points appearing to be the front. As it was very dark outside, it was hard to make out the color of the aircraft, but we did observe that it had a light on each corner. It was flying extremely low to the ground (right above the treetops) and from what I remember, made absolutely no noise. It was also extremely large, and although it is hard to estimate the size, it was definitely larger than our car. Afterwards we both looked at each other in absolute shock and tried to figure out what we saw. We both concluded any other aircraft that we are familiar with would make some noise, and wouldn���t be flying so low. We couldn���t find a plausible explanation for the sighting."],"Case Number":"35374","Date Submitted":"01/31/2012 08:08 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"08/06/2010 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-01312012-0008","Region":"Massachusetts","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Sharon","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.12725,+-71.174894(35374)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35374) map </A>","Latitude":"42.12725","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Summary":"A large dark triangular shaped aircraft with lights on each corner.
