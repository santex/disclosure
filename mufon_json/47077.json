I first noticed the object because of the red, white, greenish blue light it was putting off. At first we thought it was a star doing something weird, my husband said \"it's moving\" we quickly got a telephone pole in our sight to judge the \"movement\" & sure enough it was ascending & descending. It looked to be a sort of zig zag pattern at the beginning then it started up & down followed by back & forth again. After seeing the movement with the lighting pattern we decided it was not a plane nor any seemingly man made object. We watched it for 15 minutes, went inside for 5 and it was gone. This is the first time I've ever encountered anything of this sort & it was amazing, whatever it was!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Wagoner","Summary":"Bright starlike in eastern sky, random light pattern, ascending & descending randomly","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
