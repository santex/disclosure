We saw it because of it's brightness. I had no idea as to what this could be--I've never seen anything like it. It was stationary in the sky--no motion at all. My primary emotion was curiosity. I said to the driver \"I think that must be a UFO.\" We both joked about me finally seeing one. I immediately got on a cell phone to call a friend. Not sure how it disappeared--we were driving past a stand of tall trees & when we drove past the trees, it was gone."],"City":"Hendersonville","Object Shape":"Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.321838,+-82.456133(26555)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26555) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"ball of light"}
