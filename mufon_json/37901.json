{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my girlfriend were driving home from Angola and we got about 10 miles from Lagrange we both seen a very bright white light that was hovering about a mile above the ground . It was moving back and forth and the light would get brighter as it got closer and dimmer as it got farther away . There were no planes or anything else near this object. It lasted about an hour and it finally disapeared into the sky. My girlfriend was Freaking out but I thought it was pretty neat ."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.646097,+-85.410457(37901)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37901) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"LaGrange","trends":["There has been one other sighting in LaGrange","There were no other sightings in LaGrange on or around May 3rd 2012"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Very awesome to watch lots of movement and great lights .","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.646097","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05032012-0015","Date of the Event":"05/03/2012 10:20 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Longitude":"-85.410457","Date Submitted":"05/03/2012 10:57 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37901.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37901.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"37901","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
