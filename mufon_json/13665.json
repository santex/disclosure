{"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","divs":["Sighting Details On November 12, 2007 in Stillwater, OK on the Oklahoma State campus, I was returning to my apartment after my Monday night class, which should have been around 9:20 local time. I was heading east from campus and as I got to a parking lot I saw two bright objects slowly floating down above a cloud, which appeared to be east of the campus. These objects were mostly white, perhaps with a dull yellowish tint, with a glow around the brighter center. At first I thought it was a meteor breaking up, (they were close together) but they continued to fall slowly, keeping shape and drifting in and out from each other. I was able to watch them for about 30 seconds until they disappeared behind the cloud. I���m guessing conservatively that they were anywhere from 5,000-20,000 feet in the air. After they disappeared I began to search the sky because of the excitement and within probably 30 seconds of losing the first formation I saw something completely different, but much more intriguing. I saw, a formation of about 6-7 objects traveling in a checkmark formation across the sky. These objects looked like they were in orbit, and appeared like dashes ( - ) compared to the stars. This formation traveled from west to east, keeping a checkmark formation the entire time. I followed the formation with my eyes for about 15-20 seconds until they disappeared beyond the horizon. I guess the first formation can be explained as flairs, but the second formation has me baffled. If you���ve seen the International Space Station fly across the sky before, I would say the formation was traveling about 2-3 times as fast across the sky. It wasn't until I began watching \"UFO Hunters\" on the History Channel that I got the idea to report this encounter online. I'm hoping that other UFO reports can be found from the area on the night of Nov 12, 2007."],"City":"Stillwater","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Oklahoma","Date of the Event":"11/12/2007 09:20 UTC","Object Shape":"Chevron, Sphere","Latitude":"36.124547","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Longitude":"-97.052508","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.124547,+-97.052508(13665)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13665) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13665.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13665.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"13665","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Stillwater","There were no other sightings in Stillwater on or around November 12th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11112008-0009","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/12/2007 09:20 UTC","Summary":"Two completly different formations within two minutes over Stillwater, OK.","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
