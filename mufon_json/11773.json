{"Object Shape":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi was asleep but my partner was awake because from nowhere firworks were being lit and fired off. my partner woke me up because he saw these things and he was freaked out, i missed the first part of this however he saw them from the beginning he exclaimed they just rose from the distance into the sky (like a firework), but then they took a straight left direction, which fireworks do not do!!! it was around 11.15pm. in the distance, high up, the first bright light moved across the sky in a straight line, it was not flashing but it was bright - it was bright orange\\ytellow and had no ditinct shape to it, like a fuzzy outline i suppose you could say circular. at first i thought 'plane' but then i saw the other one and was like, ok thats definatly not a plane, with no flashing lights it just wasn't possible. what was strange is and determined suspicions that what we were witnessing was not natural not man made (i.e aircraft) was that the first one stopped dead and didn't move, as the second object got closer it was practically next to it, when they were together as a pair they started to disappear, it was like it was waiting for the second object to join it. it looked as though they were flying so high into the sky that they disapearred they got fainter and fainter. more beculiar was that the third light followed the same path and when it got to the same spot it did exactly as the other 2 did. i was so intrigued, i could not explain it. me and my partner were not the only witnesses as there was a couple who saw them and i heard them say how weird it was, then minutes later another group of people walked by and they said 'how is it possible two aircrafts could be that close together with no sound being heard either'. i could not sleep for the rest of the night i was constantly at the window with my camera and camcorder hoping i could see them again, but they were long gone, it was weird. i felt scared that these could be real, i have never thought about alians or strange beings as i think sometimes there honest explanations, in this case, how cleverly they moved direction (so smoothly), i cannot provide an explanation, hoping that someone else can, i was so freaked out, i have never seen anything like this before."],"Longitude":"-1.140592","Case Number":"11773","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"GB-07272008-0008","Date Submitted":"07/26/2008 11:15 UTC","Country":"United Kingdom","Latitude":"52.740123","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.740123,+-1.140592(11773)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11773) map </A>","City":"Leicestershire","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11773.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11773.html"],"Summary":"3 x bright orange lights, steadily moving, in a straight line one by one","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"England","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Leicestershire","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"07/26/2008 11:15 UTC"}
