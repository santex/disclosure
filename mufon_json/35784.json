Witness was out smoking from her place of work and saw in the distance \"A red line that kept on getting larger just like fire\" that seemed to be falling towards horizon. Witness watched for several minutes until she could no longer see it behind the houses in front of her. Picture taken but witness said the object was much more visible with own eyes. 1st picture is the original, you can see object just above the building on the left. 2cd is a zoomed in on picture. 3rd is in differential coloring."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
