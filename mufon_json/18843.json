{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving on 96 eastbound in Brighton, I saw two groups of orange orb like objects in the sky. These were not flares because they split up to form two groups. And headed in different directions..mainly heading north and east. They were about as high as a small aircraft would fly, so not very high up at all. Plus they were about twice the size as a small aircraft but were round and glowing orange. Very simple looking! I noticed these lights because at first it looked like a craft starting to land on an airport, thats how bright they were. No flashing lights, no sound, and it was a breezy cloudy night and you could actually see them lowering and then going back up in the clouds...like they were hiding! Many people had to of seen this in Oakland and Livingston County, you could not miss this. A few cars pulled off the side of the road. It was insane to see that many things in the sky at once and then to see them individually move in different directions!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18843.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18843.html"],"Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.532787,+-83.776131(18843)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18843) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"18843","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08232009-0020","Summary":"Brighton,MI 7 orange orblike objects reported around 9:53 pm.","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Brighton","There were no other sightings in Brighton on or around August 21st 2009"],"Latitude":"42.532787","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/21/2009 09:53 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/21/2009 09:53 UTC","Longitude":"-83.776131","City":"Brighton","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Other","Object Features":"None"}
