First I thought it was descending, but then the object reduced it���s speed and stopped descending and began a horizontal path at approx. 2,000 feet. I saw it during 3 or 4 minutes at 19:10, it was dark at the time, no clouds. The object emitted no lights of any kind and no sound either, at the moment I could saw a few comercial planes in the area, much brighter (with their corresponding strobe lights) and much noisier too and one helicopter, I could easily identify them however not this weird light. In bottomline I have seen before during my life (I am 31 years old) space junk falling from the skies, little meteors and this was definitely none of them and I was a private pilot too, and I have never seen sometihng like this before. I tried to film it, however my cell phone wasn���t able to film anything, too dark for my cell phone I think, and the object I am not sure if it dissapeared behind a cloud (even if I didn���t saw any cloud) or behind the smog of the city, or some weird fog or mist, not sure really, maybe it just became invisible. Difficult to say. I called inmediately the www.dgac.cl, similar to the FAA in the U.S., at 19:19, however a guard of the entity answered me and said that at that time everybody finished their work it he was all by himself and didn���t helped me at all. Thank you very much. Greetings. Francisco Sandoval. Santiago, Chile."],"Log Number":"CL-07122012-0020","Country":"Chile","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
