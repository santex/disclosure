I live @ present in Phoenix, Az in an Apt. complex. I was getting the mail, routine task....@ evening on ~ approx. August 24th, 2013...this year....~ 9:00 - 9:30 p.m. I was heading back to apt. when i looked up...as i often do..to the night sky. There above, coming from the North were several star-like SILENT objects moving quickly...they darted in and out of formation....WHICH STARS DO NOT DO....with one lower....a milky-white color...it had a strange \" tadpole-like \" shadow shape moving clock-wise underneath ! They all continued to the East...and went higher and higher up, vanishing into SPACE....'til no longer visible. I felt elated-excited like, and almost breathtakingly affected.... I had felt like i had finally witnessed something out-of-the-ordinary, what so many claim to have experienced-seen....witnessed. I personnaly felt...to me...that in some way the objects were \" conscious \" of me....which is why i felt an almost child-like happy-bright-breathless feeling......somewhat euphoric ?1"],"Date of the Event":"08/24/2013 09:20 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/30/2013 02:43 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"50289","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-08302013-0004","Sighting Duration":"00:05:01","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"34.051718"}
