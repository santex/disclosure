Two of the lights were solid white, and the other two were blinking many different colours rapidly. It hovered in the air for a couple of minutes, then bolted off at an incredibly speed. I m quite positive it wasn t any aircraft that I ve ever seen before. My wife saw it as well and we are both baffled. I don t believe in UFOs, but this was just plain wierd."],"City":"Cambridge","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
