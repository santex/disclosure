Southwest Lincoln (Looking East). I was trying to capture lightning from a strong thunder storm to the east on a Sony Cyber-shot 7.2 MP camera. The camera was set on the High Sensitivity ISO Mode. These green objects were NOT VISIBLE to the naked eye! I only noticed them when the were downloaded to the computer yesterday. Last night I tried to reproduce the images by take more photos at the exact same place and time with the camera set the same way to see if it something like lens flair or some kind of optical illusion. Over 40 more photos were taken and I could not see a hint of green!"],"City":"Lincoln","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"29662","Longitude":"-96.678889","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/19/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Egg","Summary":"Green Disks","Log Number":"US-06212011-0011","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Hoax","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.813252,+-96.678889(29662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29662) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/21/2011 02:17 UTC","Latitude":"40.813252","Region":"Nebraska"}
