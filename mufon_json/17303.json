I know what flares look like but these would be a constant brightness for several minutes then they would blink out but come back in the same exact spot. I have seen these before, even low in the sky above the town where there are no military exercises. They just appear at random in the same spot usually and stay hovering for hours. This time one dimmed out and came back then several minutes later they both were gone. Someone should definitely camp and post up somewhere over in the Estrella range because no doubt they will be back again."],"Country":"United States"}
