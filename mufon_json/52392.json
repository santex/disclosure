So we drove down the Colonial Parkway to see if we could see it from there & we could not. We were on our way home from having dinner in Williamsburg, Va. when we saw the light. We have no idea what it was. We have lived in our home for 17 years & have never seen anything quite like it before. t was very bright. We had not been drinking. We are in our 50's. This is our first sighting report. I definately felt we were experiencing something unusual and perhaps extraterrestrial. It wasn't right. Something was \"off\" about it. My husband is an engineer. He was determined to prove to me that it was just a very, very, bright star that was really low & went behind the clouds. So he drove up and down the Colonial Parkway in his attempt to find the star. We never saw it again."],"Latitude":"37.436583","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.436583,+-78.648004(52392)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52392) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed"}
