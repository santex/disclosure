Watching an extremely large flying wing pass directly over between 2,000 and 3,000 ft headed South. The vehicle color appeared light gray against the black sky as it passed over blocking the stars. The detail and outline was very sharp and clear. No smoke or noise. The wing shape was much like the old YB-49 flying wing bomber and much like the large vehicle recorded in Arizona. This is within controlled Houston Hobby airport TCA airspace and this vehicle was at least 4 times larger than the typical Southwest Airlines aircraft. I have seen the large black triangle aircraft very close, within 100 ft distance as they pass along the FEMA controlled rivers property headed towards the Gulf of Mexico several times in the past. These black triangle always have an armed F16 escort when traveling. This flying wing type of vehicle was much larger and faster."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.761953,+-95.36062(8731)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8731) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/14/2007 12:03 UTC","City":"Houston","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/14/2007 12:03 UTC","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around November 14th 2007"],"Latitude":"29.761953","Case Number":"8731"}
