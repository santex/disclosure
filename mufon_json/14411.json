{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"14411","Country":"United States","Region":"New Jersey","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was the summer of 2001 when my neighbor's youngest son knocked on our door. \"There is something in the sky��� he said, come and see. I went to look along with my wife and son. We found our neighbor, his wife and two boys looking up at the 9pm night sky. All of us witnessed the same event. High in the sky was a glowing light, similar to a florescent tube. No sound was made. The sky was fairly clear with some passing clouds. This was no star or planet or meteor or comet or even a weather balloon! I would know the difference. It appeared to be far enough as to be in space, either at the edge or just above our atmosphere. I imagine it was of great size to be visible from that height. We watched as the tube seemed to shrink and almost fade out but then it grew back. Sometimes it would appear to be rotating on its axis, spinning end over end. One thing I noticed as we watched it perform its maneuvers was that it remained in the exact same place in the sky for over an hour. That told me that it was geo-synchronous and moving exactly with the earth. Had to have some kind of intelligence behind it. It did not fly away in any direction. After a while, I went for my telescope and set it up to view the object. The light seemed to have a greenish glow when viewed from the ground but through my telescope, I could see a definite cylindrical shape that glowed white. It also looked to me to be translucent, not really solid. It would almost shrink and fade out of existence then would suddenly be there again. I remember thinking; this must be a government experiment in space. I didn't think it was a UFO at that time. I had recently viewed a lecture (on one of those college TV channels) on lasers and particle beam technology. This object seemed to behave exactly the same way as a particle beam would when being manipulated by an opposing laser vibrating at the same frequency as the beam. The beam would grow and then retreat according to the pressure applied by the opposing laser. I figured the government had something big going on up there. But then I read more about other sightings and how similar some of them were to ours. Other people reported seeing an object that would seem to fade in and out of existence. Also, many were initially viewed as cylindrical that would change phase. I thought that was pretty accurate. I also began to realize that the space station and shuttle all travel in an orbit and do not stay in one place for over an hour. My neighbors were convinced that what they were witnessing was an actual UFO. It took me a few years before I would believe it also. My neighbor said he phoned the local news channel but was told it was probably a \"weather balloon\". The next week an unusual amount of press came out about meteors and such. I figured this was just some attempt at disinformation for the public sake. To this day I have no idea what we all saw that night or how many others viewed it also. I have seen many happenings in the sky over the years. I have seen satellites fly by on their very high and very straight course. I know the difference between stars and planets and meteors and such. This was not any of those. Not swamp gas either. This was a very large object at high altitude under intelligent control, doing some weird things. Not natural at all. Not the aurora borealis. It was very localized in the sky. I went back in the house and came out several times that evening to look again at the sky. I don't remember at what point it vanished for good. It did not return."],"trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date of the Event":"08/21/2001 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-74.397401","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Other","Latitude":"40.064674","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.064674,+-74.397401(14411)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14411) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-12142008-0009","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Luminescent tube of Greenish to White light changing shape and size high in the sky, sometimes rotating, fixed position for over an hour.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14411.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14411.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/21/2001 12:00 UTC"}
