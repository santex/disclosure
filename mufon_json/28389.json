Twice I have seen two other lights with it. The most prominent light appears for about an hour and then fades. It hovers in the same place every night. The two other lights that I have seen with it move away but this one fades to nothing like it goes away from Vegas and the fade is very fast. I smoke on my patio before I go to bed at night. I go to sleep around 6 pm. every night. I always look at the night sky so I have seen things like this over Vegas all the time. I first thought that it was a plane or a bright star but it was to low to the ground and to bright to be a star. It stays stationary and then fades to nothing, like it moves away from Vegas at a high speed. I really wouldn't have mentioned this because it is common to see such things over Vegas but this is keeps happening every night."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"28389","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03242011-0016","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.116286,+-115.168056(28389)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28389) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"36.116286","City":"Las Vegas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28389.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28389.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-115.168056"}
