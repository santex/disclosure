Same time frame or very close. It was about 5:50 when I was looking at the sky again at the same area I always look. Then right next to the same star as on the 4th a star like object appears next to the dim star and starts lighting up very very bright. This time it got very big and very very bright. It was larger than the size of the largest star. Then it dimmed down just like the others and started traveling south very very slow. Slower than the last ones I saw. It was headed south again so I jumped up to grab my camera and it was gone. I am going to try to set up a cam but I need a night vision cam. This is getting very strange and I will try to record the event or get a witness,"],"Longitude":"-118.434655","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around April 9th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28591.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28591.html"],"Summary":"Another Star like objects lights up dims down and flies south","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-04092011-0003","Latitude":"33.960632","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/09/2011 11:39 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/09/2011 05:58 UTC"}
