I looked up at the sky and noticed what I thought was a plane, flying lower than normal. As it passed over me going south I noticed that it didn't have any wings. It was like a missile really long about 200 ft long judging from its height in the sky. Dark in color with reddish bands around it pointed tip and kind of shimmering in the sky. I could see other planes higher in the sky leaving trails and could see even at that height, plane wings...but could see no wings on the missile-like object. I passed due south over our house and by the time I went to the front of the house I couldn't see it anymore."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5288.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5288.html"],"Region":"Utah","Date of the Event":"08/22/2006 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/22/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"5288","Latitude":"40.763879","Log Number":"US-08222006-0004","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Salt Lake City","There were no other sightings in Salt Lake City on or around August 22nd 2006"],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"07:34:18","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
