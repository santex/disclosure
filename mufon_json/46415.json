As we watched them move to the West, which seemed to move about 20 miles per hour, we observed them turn into 6 stars, 4 big and 2 small. As they moved toward the West, they went into a half arc formation. The 3rd star moved upward into the 2nd star and at the same time the 6th star moved upward into the 5th star. Which made 2 stars on top and 2 stars on bottom. As they moved across the sky, they moved diagonal one way, then diagonal the other way, then they moved parallel across to the West, then suddenly disappeared."],"Country":"United States"}
