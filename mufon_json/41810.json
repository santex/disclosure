Listening to Coast to Coast AM & took a break to smoke in back yard. 2. Was taking pictures of the full moon and then the UFO lit up and flew off after my camera flashes went off. 3. A UFO which you can clearly see in my photo's. 4. It was hovering between and inside two chemtrails in a cloaked mode but we could see it in the sky due to the reflection of the moon. I was taking pictures and my flash was going off when the ship lit up in bright light, moved to the right and flew headed north with a bright white light trailing it. 5. I was amazed; specially when I looked at my photos from my digital camera and it actually showed up. 6. It flew away after my camera flashed 4 times."]}
