I was principal of our county-wide middle-school and the superintendent of schools was my neighbor across the street. An oilfield worker lived next door to him and the three of us would sometime sit out in our lawn chairs on the superintendent���s driveway chatting and enjoying the cool of the evening. None of us were drinking. It was a moonless night with no streetlights and the sky was crystal clear. Looking into the starry Milky Way was a beautiful sight. Occasionally we���d spot a satellite inching across the night sky. The superintendent���s garage was attached to the house by an opened covered walkway about 18 or so feet long. I was sitting facing southwest and had a good view of the sky under and above the walkway. My neighbors were facing one north and one southeast. A bright object arose either out of the southern sky or it may have risen from the ground like ball lighting and it arced up and toward the north. It was shooting out sparks all around and making a sizzling, rapidly ���shushing��� noise It appeared to be round and spinning, but I couldn���t be sure of this or of its size and altitude. It continued rising and arcing north and I lost sight of it momentarily as it passed behind the roof of the covered walkway. I looked straight up to see where it was going but it seemed to have disappeared. Then as I gazed up I realized that there was a long, dark shape visible only because it was silhouetted by the bright starry sky. It was black and as I stared up I became aware of one, then a second large round port very, very dimly lighted. The sound was the most amazing part in that the dark shape was thrumming so low that I could only feel its vibration in my chest like the lowest notes of a pipe organ or far off thunder. The vibration was like an idling motor being revved slowly again and again. I don���t know how long it stayed there but it began to drift slowly toward the west. The impression I got was that it just slid sideways until it dwindled to a dot and was gone. Could be that the object remained stationary and the earth rolled away to the east? The three of us just sat there silently. Then I spoke up and said, ���What do you think that was?��� The superintendent replied guardedly, ���I don���t know.��� It was never mentioned again by any of us. Anyone seeing a UFO then or now is usually suspect. If anyone has had a like experience, I���d like to discuss it with them. sreyaw610@hotmail.com."],"Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10677.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10677_submitter_file1__Possibl2..png","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10677.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10677.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05062008-0004","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"10677","Longitude":"-99.897113"}
