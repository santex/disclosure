It was silent and moving the same speed as a jet. I live nearby Edwards afb and Plant 42 in Palmdale. I'm used to seeing military craft flying all the time but this object did not look like anything I've seen before. It made no noise and the entire body was illuminated. At first I thought it might have been a bird gliding but I cant think of any birds that glow at night. It flew northeat towards Edwards afb. It faded off in the distance. It looked the size of a fighter jet. It was too small and WAY too quiet to be the B-2. I saw it as a triangular object but my girlfriend said it looked like a boomerang."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.695575,+-118.150393(24668)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24668) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/20/2010 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Silent triangular/boomerang shaped aircraft.","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Case Number":"24668","Date Submitted":"07/20/2010 05:48 UTC","City":"Lancaster","Latitude":"34.695575","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Lancaster","There were no other sightings in Lancaster on or around July 20th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24668.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24668.html"],"Longitude":"-118.150393","Tags":"City"}
