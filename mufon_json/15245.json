It seemed to slow down and change from white to slightly red then vanish. On realizing what we were seeing, my wife and I both got goose bumps and felt our eyes watering. Almost right away it was seen again much lower in the sky moving from east to west. At this point it was white again. It moved fairly quickly across the sky and then vanished again. The reason it caught our eye was that it had no flashing lights or sound. Living near Buckley Airforce base and Denver International Airport we see aircraft all the time. There are always flashing lights on the planes and quite a bit of noise. We unfortunately have no photos or video to back what we saw."],"Longitude":"-104.82629","Region":"Colorado","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15245.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15245.html"],"Summary":"Solid white light that turned to red moving quickly then changing place and direction.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.739302","Date of the Event":"02/01/2009 06:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
