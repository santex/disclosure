had started our day getting our 27��� rv readied for the trip; we were first going to spend a couple days at a friend���s cabin in the isabella, mn. area and then i was intent on taking her to a spot i had camped in for years spending several days there just enjoying the remote calmness of the great northwoods. as per usual, we found ourselves leaving much later in the day than we should have and knowing we had to get to our first destination before nightfall as the area was more familiar to me during the day and i wanted to avoid driving around up there after dark. we made it close to our destination as it was getting on towards dusk and i decided to take a ���shortcut��� i had vaguely remembered in an effort to save time, i have only used this route a couple of times and only during the day. needless to say, we missed a turn and got semi ��� lost. having no map readily available, i decided to head back for the hiway and take my original route. we finally got back to the highway about 45 minutes later and found our way back to our original route. by this time it was almost completely dark, only the last bit of orange sunlight left on the horizon which was rapidly giving way to a beautiful starry night that is one of the draws for me to the northwoods. unfortunately i didn���t document the event as it was happening so i���m not too sure of the exact area we are in at the time. the event started as i was driving along guessing we had about 45 minutes to go before we got to the cabin. i noticed a round yellow \\ orange light to my left out the driver���s side window of our class ���c��� motor home, for those who don���t know the difference, a class ���a��� motor home looks like a box and a class ���c��� has a front end like a truck or van with a sleeper above the cab or drivers compartment. the light i was observing while trying to drive was larger than a star and about half the size that the full moon would generally appear on a night with no rain in site. i didn���t really think a lot of what i was looking at until i started making a gradual right turn to follow the road we were on. normally when you are looking at something out the left window and you start turning to the right the object in the window will move out of your view and behind you but in this case the object itself seemed to vanish before i completed the direction change and reappeared in front of us viewable through the upper right portion of the windscreen at a distance of approximately 500 ft. my wife had taken notice of the object at the same time as i was pointing it out to her and she actually had a better view of it than i did as i was still trying to pay attention to the road and pull over and shut off the motor to better observe it. at first after pulling over i watched for a few seconds to half a minute and decided that what i was watching was fireworks, just the plain yellow type like a mortar since the object seemed to be moving upwards towards an apex before descending. the object moved fairly slowly in its climb and then started a descent making a zigzag pattern leaving a brilliant trail of light in its wake. by this time i seriously doubted that i was watching fireworks and instead thought it might be a helicopter but quickly ruled that out since we were several miles from any kind of real civilization and with the windows down we literally heard no sound other than the usual sounds you would hear such as crickets. the object continued to stay in its general location referenced by the windscreen as we sat quietly watching it make several moves to the right, left, up and down. after about 10 minutes of this the object rose slowly and gracefully for a bit and what seemed to resemble sparks shot out of the top of the object and reconnect with it, then it started to move away but also seemed to vanish before it would have moved out of view, this seemed to be the end of the show and we started up and slowly pulled away from our spot on the side of the road and out of the bottom right corner of the windscreen i observed a very small light closer to dark orange or red in color shoot off towards the top left of the windscreen at a very high rate of speed i guess it would have resembled a tracer round and moved as fast. i also remember getting a feeling that it was gone. this was the last we saw of the object and we proceeded to enjoy a wonderful week in the northwoods without further incident. it was kind of funny, during the entire episode all i was thinking in my head was ���i don���t have time for this��� we only had a short time to be there and i didn���t want to spend it dealing with something like an abduction or missing time. also, i���m not sure what kept me from actually getting out of the motor home and getting a better look but i was compelled to stay right where i was. i had a camera but i didn���t think of it at the time plus i was too busy staring at the object and my adrenaline was flowing. my wife has always been a skeptic and i was glad she had an opportunity to see this. i���m not sure if she���s a total convert or not but she got a better show than i did and seems to now believe. we have since relocated to the general area of the sighting and have been fortunate enough to have a few other sightings but nothing like this."],"Longitude":"-92.098885","Date Submitted":"05/15/2004
