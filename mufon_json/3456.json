I was giving my dog her food and I hear this sound. It wasn t a loud sound more like a soft sound, it sounded like \"loooooo\". I look up and there s these lights I can see through the clouds. It s cloudy right now I could only see the lights, 2 lights were white facing opposite to eachother, other 2 lights were going in a circle around themselves and were red and greeen, there were another 2 lighs that were also swirling around themselves and were facing opposite to the other 2, and they were also red and green. IT was like a square made of lights but you could only see the corners. I was so shocked when I saw it I just started up and didn t move until it wasn t visible anymore. It just disappeared into the clouds, it s very cloudy right now which is rare here in Phoenix Arizona. I came to my senses when my dog jumped on me and then I came inside to report this."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.456847,+-112.071377(3456)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3456) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.456847","Tags":"City","Summary":"Square made of 6 lights in the sky","Longitude":"-112.071377","Date Submitted":"03/20/2005 02:34 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/20/2005 02:34 UTC","Case Number":"3456","Region":"Arizona","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
