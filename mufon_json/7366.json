Knowing that ufo's like to frequent the area around airliners I started taking pictures. I got 13 in all but I am only posting 3 pict's for now. They didn't show up until I uploaded them onto the pc and zoomed in. I have only adjusted the contrast and brightness for clarity. I am convinced that the black orbs or disks that I am seeing, after looking at many of my photographs with various levels of zoom and contrast, are actually only part of what were able to see due to various patterns in the area around them. Almost as if the rest of the huge craft is cloaked. Some are actually miles wide. Nothing else could explain the various straight lines and angles I see when zooming in at various resolutions. Never any noise."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"UFO's over my neighborhood.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/04/2007 12:00 UTC","City":"Narrows","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"7366","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.33273,+-80.808727(7366)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7366) map </A>","Latitude":"37.33273","Longitude":"-80.808727","Region":"Virginia","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2007 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
