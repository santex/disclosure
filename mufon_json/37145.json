I did not observe anything mysterious that day. I was in the downtown area of my hometown, taking photos for my project.I was photographing the fading company logo on the back of an old, abandoned transfer & storage property. Later that evening, I was copying & saving all the photos I had taken that day, & when I reviewed this one, I noticed an unusual object in the sky above the building. I imediately knew it was not a conventional aircraft, a camera defect, or a bird. I use a fully functioning digital camera to take my photos."],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Log Number":"US-04052012-0012"}
