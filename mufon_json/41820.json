The dome lights were recessed the craft was a mile long triangle half mile wide. Sides half mile high each side five hundred feet thick. Sides are mirrored. Rear had an exhaust spanning the two sides,about one forth up rounded opening. Near the end of me trying to take this in a figure appeared in dome closest to me and it ,as if to distract me a few seconds later it moved exstremly fast due north wished I'd waved.Then I heard the plane again.I know I saw a craft, humanity couldn't conceive building something this big I've had time to think about this If the Navy made some breakthoughs in holograghic projectsion that could explain speed ,in a straight line this craft hovered over me for a solid five minutes.Or this craft stopped so it wouldn't hit the plane going east to west, thats a good sign I thought. I told my daughter shortly after she told me some people saw it in Oxbow Apts. several miles due north of my sighting. And recently I've seen the Pheonix documentary they saw it. But if it passed right over head why didn't they see the recessed lights.I last saw this craft excelarating due north appox. five hundred feet in altitude gone in an instant.Laugh if you will I saw it up close and personal.Egyptian Pyrimids closest thing on earth to copy its shadow.I feel better thank you!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"see below","Object Features":"Dome","Country":"United States","Region":"Rhode Island","Date Submitted":"08/17/2012 11:28 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle","Longitude":"-71.469519","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/16/2011 08:00 UTC","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.584284,+-71.469519(41820)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41820) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
