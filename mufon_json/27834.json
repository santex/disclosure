The temperature was around 30 degrees and the sky was clear. I had just gotten out of the vehicle and was going up on the back deck to enter the house when we heard what sounded like a military jet going overhead. This is unusual in our area at this time of year. I looked up and saw two lights, moving at a rapid rate across the sky, the front one moving more slowly while the one in back overtaking it. Then the front one abruptly zigged, then zagged (my best description) then disappeared into the sky. The second light then also faded into the southwestern sky."],"Summary":"2 lights in night sky one of them zigzags","Date of the Event":"02/14/2011 07:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"27834"}
