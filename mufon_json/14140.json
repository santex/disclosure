We were outside for about 10 minutes before I spotted it. It was about 30 degrees up in the sky and further south of us towards Butte Falls, lots smaller than the previous sightings. I had my husband keep an eye on it and ran in to grab my video camera and tell the kids. My son brought out the telescope and sighted it in, he said it looked like a star. We could see that it was moving West for a few minutes and then it exploded, as it did that you could barely see it with the eyes anymore, though we could see it falling or decending in the video camera and telescope. After we lost sight of it I had one of the kids go see what time it was and it was 4:43 pm. All we can tell everyones is to keep looking at the Southern Oregon Sky between 4 and 5 pm, well look at the sky as much as possible anyways, no matter what time it is."],"Date of the Event":"11/29/2008 04:40 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Prospect","There were no other sightings in Prospect on or around November 29th 2008"],"Region":"Oregon","Log Number":"US-11292008-0027","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"14140","Summary":"Bright sphere in southern sky east of Jupiter & Venus (explodes).","Country":"United States","City":"Prospect","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like"}
