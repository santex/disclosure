The object was dim and hard to see. The object moved in a straight line at a slow steady speed and then vanished or seemed to dim out. I was walking my dog across the golf course as I do every night between 8pm to about 8:30 pm. I was looking for it (star-like objects)as they are a common occurance in this area. I picked up the hobby of star gazing about a year ago, bought a telescope. It was at that time that my girlfriend observed the star-like objects and pointed them out to me. It's been my hobby ever since then. My feelings are that I know that the star like objects are ufo's and that they are piloted by life more advanced than ours. I was airforce and now I am a retired peace officer. We are not alone lol. Ufo's are cool."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"05/13/2009 08:20 UTC","Latitude":"32.702631","Longitude":"-114.619542","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05142009-0002","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Yuma","There were no other sightings in Yuma on or around May 13th 2009"],"Case Number":"16917","Tags":"City"}
