BUT WHAT about those four lights in a straight line that are between the sun and the large red spot in the photo. Zoom in on those 4 lights and you will see what I am referring to. That looks more like a UFO to me than the teardrop which could be a bug on the lense. CHECK OUT THE 4 LIGHTS that form a LINE. Also you listed as 2010 but the Google photo is stamped 2008. Just wanted to make a note of that for you. I assume 9am by position of sun in sky."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-106.450864","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24570.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24570.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.939916,+-106.450864(24570)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24570) map </A>","Log Number":"CA-07162010-0022","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"52.939916","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/30/2007 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Reply to: 2010-07-16 Check GOOGLE MAPS for Mona St, Oxbow, SK - look near the sun - teardrop shaped UFO.","City":"Undisclosed"}
