My wife saw it first as it appeared just above the fireworks we were watching. She thought it was part of the fireworks display until it kept moving towards us and eventually went directly over our house. It was a luminous round orange object that \"glowed\" and kind of pulsated. Never seen anything like it and we were both astonished at what we were seeing. There were no flashing lights and it made no sound whatsoever. It was flying no higher than a small plane and moved slowly. There were other small planes in the area observing the numerous fireworks displays around our area and we could hear their engines. The object traveled from the west in a straight line to the east until we could no longer see it."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.192364,+-94.121144(18109)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18109) map </A>","Summary":"Luminous orange glowing object passed over our house spotted from the western horizon and traveled east in a straight line","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arkansas"}
