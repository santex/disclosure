I thought it was a star for a few moments because it wasn't moving. I stood there for about 3 or 4 minutes and thought how odd. No flashing lights or sound. I then decided to grab my camera and take a photo of it and in less than a minute when I returned it was gone. I stepped away from the house and looked 360 degrees to see if it had moved to a different part of the sky. We get airplanes around our house all the time and I can always step outside and have time to follow them in the sky but not this time, it was just gone."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.880722,+-110.359816(45020)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45020) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/04/2013 06:26 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/01/2013 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01042013-0017","Case Number":"45020","Latitude":"46.880722","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45020.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45020.html"],"Object Features":"None","Region":"Montana","Summary":"Viewed a stationary red light as big as the planet Venus while looking NEat the moon.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
