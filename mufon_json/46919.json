I always try to do this if it's a clear night. I rally enjoy looking at the night sky. As I was scanning the sky I noticed a pulsing light off to the west. I watched it for several minutes. It was a blue pulsating object that was moving very slowly. It made several position changes but always seemed to be moving to the west and northwest. I watched it for about an hour as it slowly moved away. It is still visable as I write this at 10:40 pm, but is so far away as to be very faint."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"01:10:00","Date Submitted":"04/22/2013 10:43 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.965686,+-80.761982(46919)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46919) map </A>","Log Number":"US-04222013-0033","Latitude":"39.965686"}
