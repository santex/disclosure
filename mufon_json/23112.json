In the corner of my eye I saw a redish orange ball streaking acrossed the sky at a downward angle heading towards the West. My radio was on and my windows were up so I couldnt hear any sounds coming from the 'object'. The ball of lights disappeared behind the trees and I did not see anymore of them after that. The whole thing lasted only around 10 seconds. I only saw the only ball that was red and orange in color. After seeing the ball of colors I felt boggeled. It was weird. I didnt know or couldnt explain what it was that I saw that morning. I immediatley called my girlfriend and explained to the best of my ability what I saw."],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Oval, Star-like","Date Submitted":"05/03/2010 10:47 UTC","City":"Hell","Latitude":"42.43472"}
