I start to see flashes in the sky, but i say \"na just an airplane\". Then, a loud flash pops out, and an egg like figure was just standing there in the middle of the sky, i would have to say no more than 300 feet from the sky. From my garage, the object was clearly seen. Then out of nowhere, the object splits in two. I stand there, looking at something no more than 1000 - 2000 feet from me. Then these two objects start circling each other, each time getting closer to each other. Then silence. The two objects dissapeared. All that was left was the memory."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Dome","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Doral","There were no other sightings in Doral on or around November 25th 2008"],"Latitude":"25.819542","Summary":"It just across the sky.","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"14041","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Shape":"Egg","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14041.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14041.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:08","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-80.35533","Date Submitted":"11/25/2008 07:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-11252008-0047","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.819542,+-80.35533(14041)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14041) map </A>"}
