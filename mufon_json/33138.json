I looked up and it seemed to be just hovering and then it started to move very slowly in a South East direction. As we are watching this object basicly float away from us, and there was no sound, the next thing I hear is a helicopter coming in our direction. I told my husband that what ever it is, its being followed by the helicopter. As I was watching the object and the helicopter I couldnt but notice that the helicopter was keeping its distance from the object but following it at a safe distance and speed as the object."],"Log Number":"US-11042011-0019","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"Star like object hovering above us then slowly leaves in a South East direction.","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Decatur","There were no other sightings in Decatur on or around November 4th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.800476,+-88.927302(33138)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33138) map </A>","Case Number":"33138","Date Submitted":"11/04/2011 08:27 UTC","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/04/2011 06:45 UTC","Longitude":"-88.927302","City":"Decatur","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
