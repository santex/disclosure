I have never seen or claimed to see a ufo in my life. On new years eve 2012, I took my dog out to go to the bathroom around 11:10 pm. I noticed a red light in the sky to the south. At first it had a bit of an aura around it which made me think it was a Chinese lantern. As it got closer the aura disappeared and it made me think maybe it was a meteor or something. But the object continued to move northwest at a steady pace. It moved a little slower than a low flying plane, it took around a minute and a half to travel from horizon to horizon. Whatever it was flew pretty much right over my head, and made no sound at all. All the geese on the nearby lake were going crazy like I'd never heard them before. Although that may have been from fireworks that were being set off. Well that's about all i can say. It really got my heart racing, never seen anything like it in my life."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Around 11:10 pm on new years eve 2012 i saw a glowing red/orange orb fly over my head a little slower than a low flying plane.","Longitude":"-88.497086","City":"Oconomowoc","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-01112012-0008"}
