{"City":"Moncton","Log Number":"CA-08112012-0021","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailsi was standing in my backyard with my 2 friends mike and nadine when all 3 of us noticed 4 orange\\red lights approaching from just above the tree line, moving slowly with bright lights. it moved toward where we were, the lights appeared to be quite far apart and never increased nor decreased their distance from one another. it was fairly windy that night and as it approached the wind died down signifigantly and there were birds in a tree near by that scattered as it was over our heads. though it was black in color it also blocked out the stars. shortly after the birds took flight it then disappeared beyond the horizon. we just stood there dumbfounded. i said i have to report this but they urged me not to for fear of ridicule. i told several friends of mine in the years following and a few of them said they had seen similar things at night. unlike navigating lights on an aircraft these did not flicker. there was no distortion in the lights and the color was so pure and surreal.we were standing in clear view if the sky with barely any distractions or objects that might distort the view. there were not any clouds visable in the sky nor airplanes, and this craft made no sound but it seemed that it did block the wind.it moved so perfectly fluid through the sky. i was more amazed and extremely curious than afraid. fear is a mind killer. id rather optimize an experience without fear so i can have as ballanced a perspective and memory of it as possible. the girl i was with had the same reaction as i did but she ran in the house as did my male friend but i stayed outside every night as much as possible until it got colder. the object seemed to be absolutely massive and very wide. as far as height i cant be precise but between 500 and 1000 feet."],"Date of the Event":"07/05/2007 11:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41646.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41646.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/11/2012 07:27 UTC","Summary":"massive object appears over moncton skies","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"46.102719","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City","Case Number":"41646","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Moncton","There were no other sightings in Moncton on or around July 5th 2007"],"Region":"New Brunswick","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.102719,+-64.819702(41646)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41646) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-64.819702","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Features":"Other"}
