I was on my balcony looking southeast when i noticed the light which was pulsating multiple colors. I began filming and it seemed to morph, possibly emit other objects and change its path. It went from one light to multiple lights, up to four at once. I have seen things like this before but this time I was a bit fearful. After filming it for a couple minutes it vanished."],"Summary":"Slow moving, multiple pulsating lights, appeared & re-appeared then eventually vanished","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Michigan","Date of the Event":"09/25/2012 06:09 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42899.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42899.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"42.307093","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.307093,+-85.682174(42899)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42899) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09292012-0023","Object Features":"Appendage(s)"}
