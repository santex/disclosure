{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-10312011-0024","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my mom had just finished some shopping and we were heading to the gas station at the corner of Loop 336 and 105 West Davis. It was roughly 8:35pm and my mom reacts to seeing something right as I am seeing it out of the corner of my eye. So I glanced over and we see this really bright solid white light in the sky heading east over the woods, we thought it was a plane at first that was really low but then it changed to a blueish color and double backed on its self and was going west, in a downward approach at a very high rate of speed. Then we lost site of it behind the trees. We had no idea what we saw it was very strange, i kept looking over the woods for some kind of explosion but saw nothing. We were in awe, especially my mom because she doesn't believe in that sort of stuff and to be honest i don't think she wants to believe but we cant deny what we saw."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"10/30/2011 08:35 UTC","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"30.325831","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/31/2011 01:32 UTC","Case Number":"33003","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Conroe","There were no other sightings in Conroe on or around October 30th 2011"],"Longitude":"-95.496635","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33003.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33003.html"],"Region":"Texas","Summary":"A bright white that was headed east then turned blue and headed back west downwards at a very high rate of speed.","City":"Conroe","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.325831,+-95.496635(33003)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33003) map </A>"}
