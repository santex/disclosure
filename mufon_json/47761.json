So my first instinct was to run in the middle of the street and look towards the bay cause that���s where the helicopters where heading towards. Then I said their back and we witnessed Fireball UFOś. These lights seemed to disappear and reappear, But luckily the sky was dark and cloudless so you can still see the little white dots in the sky. I was beautiful yet scary in the same way. After about 45 min the whole incident was over but the helicopters were hovering over the bay as if searching for something. This concluded this morning about 7am."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-74.532346","Summary":"Fireball UFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.370913,+-74.532346(47761)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47761) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"New Jersey","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47761.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47761.html"],"Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"39.370913","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Fireball","Date of the Event":"05/30/2013 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/31/2013 02:40 UTC"}
