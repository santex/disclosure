Someone else was with me and first alerted me to the anomaly. Driving towards it at 65 MPH for approximately 5 minutes the object did not appear to move relative to our position. It stayed fixed in the air. It had four bright white lights that I could see. One on each corner of the delta and one in the center. It also seemed to have something like a fin on the bottom in between the center corner light and central light. We drove directly under it and could not see it while it was above us. After putting the passenger side window down the object could not be located anywhere in the sky. We didn't see it disappear. It was just gone."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Cincinnati","There were no other sightings in Cincinnati on or around March 3rd 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-84.5038","Latitude":"39.105368","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36677.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/36677_submitter_file1__approximation.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36677.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"36677","Log Number":"US-03232012-0007","Date of the Event":"03/03/2012 07:42 UTC","City":"Cincinnati"}
