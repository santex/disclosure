The objects were moving W to SE with one trailing behing the other. From a distace they appear to be identical judging by the size and the exact pace they were moving. I would dismiss it if there was a landing strip nearby but there is not. I just felt I should report it just incase someone else had a better view. I discribe it as a cigar cause the object was plane like but too far to see if it had wings."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Cigar","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Could have simply been two planes."}
