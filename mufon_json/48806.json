{"Object Shape":"Star-like","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile having holiday at Carolina Beach NC, my husband and I were sitting on our boat at 10:30 pm I noticed a bright red light in the sky, which at first I thought was a beacon light for airplances. But this red light was not blinking like the beacon lights do. This looked more like a red star, where there had been no stars before in the night sky. The red light was not blinking and was not moving in any way. It was stationary. I took out our binoculars looked at the light thru them and all I could see was what appeared to be a star like object, hovering in place and glowing bright red. There were no other stars around this red object nor were there any thing else that was flying by this object. No airplanes or Helicopters were flying at the time. It was a very calm night on the water and other stars were visible. My husband and I took turns watching this red light through the binoculars for about 30 minutes. Then the light slowly reduced size and disappeared. I continued to watch that area of the night sky for it to return but it never came back. My hsband and I couldn't tell you what it is. It had no blinking lights on it, nor did it move in any way. It was just like a red light in the sky. I wanted to make this report so that if someone else sees the same thing, they will know that others have also seen it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Carolina Beach","Log Number":"US-07082013-0014","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Carolina Beach","There were no other sightings in Carolina Beach on or around July 5th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.037093,+-77.889547(48806)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48806) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48806.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48806.html"],"Longitude":"-77.889547","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"34.037093","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"48806","Summary":"Bright Red Light","Date of the Event":"07/05/2013 10:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"North Carolina","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/08/2013 03:11 UTC"}
