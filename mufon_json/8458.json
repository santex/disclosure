No sound. I was on a fishing pier at Corpus Christi NAS at the time. I just happened to look upward as the object passed overhead. Other people were there on the pier but not near me. I didn't report this at the time because I thought perhaps someone used a lazer beam to project this object in the night sky, but reviewing recent UFO sightings on your website tonight, I saw a photograph which was reported on 2007-11-25 (South mt AZ)which shows the exact same thing I saw in the night sky at Corpus Christi NAS."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Latitude":"27.806403","Object Shape":"Other","City":"Corpus Christi","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Corpus Christi","There were no other sightings in Corpus Christi on or around September 8th 2007"]}
