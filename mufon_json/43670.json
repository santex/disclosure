As we were leaving the beach, my friend turned around and said that it looked like someone had started a fire--I turned around and saw what looked like a glowing orange pot of fire. As we watched it, it lifted off with no sound, still looking like it had flames coming out of an ornage pot--it did have a white glow in the center after it lifted off--it ascended up and to the left until it dissappeared. My friend acted matter of fact about it at first. I was excited about seeing it. After my friend got home, she started to feel more curious about it. I googled it when I got home as I had never heard of an orange fiery object. It did remind me of the image in the bible about seeing chariots of fire."],"Case Number":"43670","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43670.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43670.html"],"Longitude":"-82.54961","Latitude":"27.266785","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"11/02/2012 07:30 UTC","Summary":"\"pot of fire\" looking orange glowing fiery object on beach near water, then lifted off until it dissappeared, no sound","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Sarasota","There were no other sightings in Sarasota on or around November 2nd 2012"],"Log Number":"US-11022012-0016","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.266785,+-82.54961(43670)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43670) map </A>"}
