{"divs":["Sighting DetailsHi, My name is David Gubitosa and I live in Hillsborough NJ. I recently traveled to Ireland. I was taking pictures of the beautiful scenery and didn't notice anything pecuilar. This picture was taken on August 25 2005. When I got home from vacation I looked at the pictures on the TV.It was then that I noticed this object. I don't know what it is. I know that it's not a bird or plane. Were I was staying in Ireland is totally country. There are no airports, and the fields are filled with sheep and cows. When I blew up the picture with my digital camera the image gets dark and blurry. Please let me know what you think it might be. I was told by a photo lab that the image is definetly too big to be a bird The camera I used was a digital Canon Elph 4.0 megapixels"],"City":"Glen Carain/Tallow","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3942","Object Shape":"Triangle, Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Region":"County Waterford","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.108274,+-8.004524(3942)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3942) map </A>","Object Features":"Wings","Longitude":"-8.004524","Date Submitted":"08/25/2005 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3942.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/3942_submitter_file1__Scotland_254.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3942.html"],"Latitude":"52.108274","trends":["there have been no other sightings in glen carain\\tallow","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"08/25/2005 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"IE-10022005-0010","Country":"Ireland","Summary":"I did not notice anything, until I got home and looked at the picture.","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
