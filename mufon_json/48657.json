I was looking up at the sky and saw an orange orb flying by. I told my friend to look and she saw it. It was faster than an airplane and traveling North West. We ran to an area without trees and could see the object was so far it was like the size of a star and then just flew too far for us to see it anymore. I saw this orb a few years ago over Lake Meade in East Berlin PA after the fireworks and around the same time. At first I didn't know what I was looking at. Then I knew it was an orb like I had seen years before. I think she was more surprised because she had never seen this before. I don't know what they are but I think they like fireworks."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-07052013-0032","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 08:43 UTC","Case Number":"48657"}
