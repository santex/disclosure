I continued to watch it for about 15 minutes. It was straight east of me no closer than probably 20-30 miles, it changed colors constantly from blue-yellow-red-white with no blinking or strobing. I got back to camp and watched it for another 30-40 minutes, it was still in the sky when I went to bed. It pulled of some extraordinary maneuvers that no aircraft could have done and hovered in 1 spot. The manuevers were pulled off in a very small space. Orions belt pointed straight down to the light the whole time. it was probably 15-20 degrees off the horizon."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Waynoka","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"10/31/2010 01:29 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-98.879814","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.582256,+-98.879814(26261)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26261) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10312010-0027","Date Submitted":"10/31/2010 08:54 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Waynoka","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"36.582256","Disposition":"Unknown"}
