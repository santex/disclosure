I managed to take a few pictures on my 5 megapixel cell phone and I can not explain what these objects were. My father (retired cargo plane & helicopter pilot with 10.000 hours experience) can not identify the objects as airplanes, helicopters or blimps. I am not one of those people who obsess with UFOs, but I really have no idea what these objects were. When I took the pictures there was only one object, but every few minutes 2 other identical objects would come into frame. Since I was driving I didn���t manage to get any pictures with more than one object in frame. The sighting lasted for about 30 minutes and the one object didn���t seem to move. It was at sunset and I could not stay to observe any longer as I was getting my nephew home. My Nephew has pictures on his 8 Megapixel digital camera (3 pictures) one of them showing the object change to a black color."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Wadesboro","There were no other sightings in Wadesboro on or around January 2nd 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"21391","Longitude":"-80.076727","Date of the Event":"01/02/2010 05:12 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"Unexplained shapes in the sky.","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
