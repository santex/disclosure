As I tracked it up there was a bigger \"Star\" orb. It was just hovering there as 3 smaller Orbs would fly in formation then split up do aerial acrobats. The larger orb would start dimming the glow very bright in a rhythmic way. Almost seemed like the 3 smaller orbs would orbit around the big, kind of like a mother ship or something. They were all moving from the south west to the North east towards the San Gabriel Mountains. Just didnt seem like anything man made, and the smaller orbs moving in uniform, doing 90 degree turns and almost appearing to stop on a dime. Very fascinating."],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"West Covina"}
