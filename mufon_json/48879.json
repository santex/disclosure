Then I observed an orb like object that was dropped from hovering object. I quickly went into the garage to fetch my binoculars. The hovering object was observed for three minutes as it traveled slowly to the northwest until treetop level obscured my view. I do not believe it was a flare that was dropped from the main object. I noticed it because the stars were shining brightly that night,and the hovering object was blinking very rapidly. I do not think it was a type of aircraft that we would have."],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"48879","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.190362","Region":"Wisconsin"}
