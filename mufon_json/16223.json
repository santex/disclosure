Are they towers? Since you said it was a volcano I thought that would be a strange place to put T.V. or radio towers unless it's a dormant volcano which obviously it is. The reason I am interested is my son took a picture not long ago and it looks very much like the black lines in your picture except we were on a airplane at 33k feet over Texas."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/24/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16223.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16223.html"],"City":"West Palm Beach","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03242009-0018","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in West Palm Beach","There were no other sightings in West Palm Beach on or around March 24th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
