I stepped out my back door to see what could have possibly been making the light and a blinding whitish green light came towards me. I have a very vague memory beyond that point but woke up naked in some woods next to my house. When I got back inside it was about 6 am, I had lost about 6 hours and I have no recollection of what happened. I have been having severe rectal bleeding since the incident and feel very nauseated. I feel very compelled towards circular objects and find myself saying the word \"obtuse\" over and over again without noticing, and even in my sleep. Yesterday for some reason I began to remember the ordeal. I remembered being drawn to the light and stepping forward. It seems that I fell into a trance and was pulled into this blinding light and I remember entering a large room with many beings inside. They were all staring at me and making this strange sound that sounded like humans moaning during an orgasm. They put me into a container which quickly filled with green liquid that I could somehow breathe in, even when fully submerged. The beings looked like little elves or something. They had humanesque feature but little bodies. Their eyes looked like about the size of an orange."],"Latitude":"35.964418","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 50 other sightings in Knoxville","There were no other sightings in Knoxville on or around March 29th 2007"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6742.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6742.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Tennessee","City":"Knoxville","Tags":"City","Case Number":"6742","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.964418,+-83.910789(6742)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6742) map </A>"}
