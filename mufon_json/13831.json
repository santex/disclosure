My daughter, her girlfriend and I were driving home from Trenton NJ on Rte 1 going South, while looking out the driver side window and left front quarter of the windsheild we saw a stream of lights coming from the sky towards the ground. It looked like the Northern lights but without color. There was 6-8 streams of them they would fade and become bright. I saw it first but did not mention it to my daughter and then she said \"mom, what is that?\". We watched it for about 10-15 minutes as we drove to drop off her girlfriend. We all had the same thought wow thats strange Northlights here. Then my daughter said maybe it was a UFO or aliens. Then we found out that there was all these sightings in the same area in the last year. Again, not sure if this is considered a UFO, but I have never in my 40+ years have seen lights like these in this area. We tried to take photos on my cell phone but was unable too it would not show up."],"Longitude":"-74.818825","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.16481,+-74.818825(13831)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13831) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/19/2008 08:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11192008-0022","Summary":"Read below."}
