{"Region":"Arkansas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Round silver object.","Case Number":"15426","divs":["Sighting Details I was out looking at the unusual number of planes leaving white trails behind them. To get a better look went inside to get binoculars. While looking at where a plane just left a trail there I saw a small silver object. Tried to see it with out binoculars but it couldn't be seen. I was looking at it for about five minutes and told husband to look but it was gone by the time he got the binoculars. I thought it was amazing to see it in daytime. I have seen many at night. I was kind of shocked and excited at the same time."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-91.950421","Object Shape":"Disc","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.030365,+-91.950421(15426)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15426) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Ward","There were no other sightings in Ward on or around February 8th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-02102009-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15426.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15426.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/08/2009 03:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"35.030365","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"02/08/2009 03:20 UTC","City":"Ward"}
