I noticed in the distance above the trees 4 bright, big fiery orange lights that seemed to either be rotating or lighting up in sequence. After all 4 were lit, it disappeared. Then it repeated the sequence a second time. I yelled to my wife to come to the door as I grabbed my video camera. By the time she got there (after the 2nd sequence) it was over and from the original position of the object I noticed there were dozens of star-like twinkling lights shooting off in all directions."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.027566,+-83.919652(46739)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46739) map </A>","Region":"Ohio","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"39.027566","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"46739","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Mount Orab","There were no other sightings in Mount Orab on or around April 9th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"4 bright orange lights","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46739.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46739.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-04112013-0013","City":"Mount Orab","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like"}
