Heard report on the RCMP scanner discribing the location of it. I had seen it for a few minutes befor but had thought that it was a star. Have no idea. It was over the old gondola ruins on Mount Hays. Moving very slowly to the SW. It must hav been some great distance away. Called a friend who lived on the otherside of the mountain, he could not see it. Then called my brother who lives just over a mile to the south of us, he could see it. I had left the baby in her crib and she got very unhappy so I went to comfort her, and it was gone when I got back. I took about a minute of vidio pictures of it but the autofocus seemed to keep losing focus and there seem to be very poor color to them."],"Latitude":"54.306145","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4583.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4583.html"],"Region":"British Columbia","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/25/2006 09:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Country":"Canada","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"03/25/2006 09:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=54.306145,+-130.310882(4583)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4583) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Prince Rupert","There were no other sightings in Prince Rupert on or around March 25th 2006"]}
