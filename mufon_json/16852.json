{"Longitude":"-104.975973","divs":["sighting detailsi came outside to my patio to smoke a cigarette at around 10:30 the evening of april 19th. as i exhaled the first time i gazed to the west sky and saw this fireball like object pulsating in the sky. i began starring at it trying to figure out what exactly it could be. as i stood there gazing at it looked like it was coming closer to my location. the object seemed to move around and be coming closer to me. the pulsating of the object became very hypnotizing and really drew my attention. after about three or four minutes or so it seemed to faded off, i then went back into my apartment to tell some company i had been entertaining what i had just saw, they just brushed me off and said i have had to much chardonnay. i really wish i had grabbed my camera as it was back in my apartment with my guests who were using it at the time. thank you for your time.
