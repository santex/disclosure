My husband was in the backyard doing yard work and hollered at me to hurry up and get outside. I looked up in the sky to see what he witnessed. It was round in shape but moving throughout the circle like jelly or birds all huddled together but not huddled because you could see spacing between the inner cylindrical units. They were white pink bright in color. We moved from the back yard gate not 2 feet to the drive way and looked back up and they were gone. They were so high in the sky. We then saw a few surface and leave again. A few minutes later I saw a flash like a spot light in the sky moving like you would see one of those advertising lights move. We saw two more shoot across the sky and have not seen anything since. We were in our driveway and noticed the garage door was opened slightly, which we do on occasion. My husband began entering numbers on the keypad to close it. It takes a series of four numbers. He hit one the door closed and then the door came up."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51344.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51344.html"],"Tags":"City"}
