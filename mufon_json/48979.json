{"trends":[],"divs":["Sighting Details1. I was sleeping in my bedroom 2. I had awoken and sat up to a bright light shinning in my eyes and thought it was very weird. 3. I didn't have much thought during the time. 4. I couldn't really see anything except what looked like a dark gray space ship hovering above my window. The light was too bright to see much more. 5. When I awoke to this I wasn't afraid, just confused about what it was. When I went back to bed I did not truly awake back to my normal state until I received my normal phone call at 6:30am. I told him when I answered that I just had the weirdest dream! 6. The object looked as if it disappeared by transforming and then it was gone."],"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/16/2013 01:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Summary":"I saw a bright light from outside my window.
