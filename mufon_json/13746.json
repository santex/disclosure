It was moving east to west direction. As the object went across sky there was absolutely no sound what so ever. Only got five pictures but you can clearly see this object going east to west but it was extremely fast, I heard after the object was out of sight about three to four minutes, the sound of couple helicopters approach from easterly direction headed westward. Could not make out what kind they were other than they were large and black looking."],"Weather Factors":"Windy","Case Number":"13746","Date of the Event":"11/11/2008 09:30 UTC"}
