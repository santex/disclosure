My aunt, myself, a friend and my mom were in the pool about 10:00 pm. We were talking and swimming..i looked up at the sky and though I was seeing geese flying in V formation. Growing up in Rosenberg TX i was used to seeing this and hearing them as they flew by. There was no sound...when I said, look at the geese, the color appeared to be pink so I joked and said look at the Flamingos...the object was moving slow...now sound...my friend says those are not birds! My Aunt looks up and looks at us and just puts her head down and says I didnt see anything...then my mom said the same thing...I know that I have been visted and possibly TAKEN since I was about 5 or 6. I remember lights in my room and waking up under my parents bed...also would try to walk out of the house in the middle of the night. All of this is just recently stopped in the last 2 years or so. I know it was real. I even remember the hooded ones in my room and still get goose bumps when I think about it. the lights would come on in my room and I would pass out being scared...wake up and tell my mom something was happening to me in the middle of the night but she didnt believe me...."],"Date of the Event":"07/11/1991 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.629146","Latitude":"29.629409","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"4439","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4439.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4439.html"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Log Number":"US-02172006-0003","Tags":"City","City":"Sugar Land"}
