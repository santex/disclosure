The light caught my eye. At first I thought it was just my eye playing a trick on me. But then I looked back up and it was still there. Just to make sure,I asked my brother and my friend if they saw it to. They said they both saw it. We kept looking at it for like 5 minutes. It would go in a circle. But it would go behind clouds so I couldnt see it sometimes. I went to go get my parents so they could see but when I got back out,I was gone. My parents thought I was just playing a trick on them. When they went back inside, I saw it again. After that,I just went back inside. And that was all I saw. So I thought I should report this."],"Case Number":"13884","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13884.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13884.html"]}
