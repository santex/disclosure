I was taking my dog out and happened to notice a bright light tothe South. It was still dark out at this time and the skies were totallyclear.At first I thought it was a plane but as it moved accross the sky I didntnotice any blinking lights common to aircraft. Also there are no flight paths inthat route. I know this because I watch the sky constantly. There was noapparent noise I could hear. It was some distance from me so that may be why. Idecided to get my Sony mini-cam and record some of it. To my astonishment when Izoomed in on the object I saw three bright white lights in a triangle formation.I taped tbe object for about thirty seconds before my battery went dead. Iwatched it disapear over some rooftops. After watching the tape a dozen times Iswear I can see the faint outline of a triangle.I need help getting thisconverted to digital format so it can be examined more thorough."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.999472","Longitude":"-88.145074","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hanover Park","There were no other sightings in Hanover Park on or around November 13th 2003"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.999472,+-88.145074(2674)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2674) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2674.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2674.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
