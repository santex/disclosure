{"Case Number":"20899","Longitude":"-86.870287","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was traveling southbound on I-65 near MM 158 when I noticed a strange V shaped cloud which looked like it had a head on it. I took a sequence of aprox 10 photos at about 1 second intervals of the cloud and didn't see the diamond shape object until after reviewing the photos. I was driving at the time so I have idea what happened to the object. Since then I have noticed more of these objects that just kind of pop-up and disappear very quickly and are completely silent. So fast in fact that if hadn't actually caught one with my camera I would not know what I was seeing. Diamond2.jpg is the same photo as Diamond1.jpg except cropped. Vcloud.jpg was taken about 1 sec before the shot that actual diamond shaped object appeared in."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20899.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20899_submitter_file1__Diamond1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20899_submitter_file2__Diamond2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20899_submitter_file3__Vcloud.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20899.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.419892,+-86.870287(20899)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20899) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.419892","Date of the Event":"08/25/2009 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-12062009-0006","Tags":"City","City":"Lafayette","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"Diamond shape UFO emerges from V-shape cloud.","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/06/2009 03:22 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Diamond","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Lafayette","There were no other sightings in Lafayette on or around August 25th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
