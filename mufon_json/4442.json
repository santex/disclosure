internationales haus sonnenberg, which is situated in the harz mountains in germany and surrounded on all sides by natioal park deep forest for miles. the nearest town is sankt andreasberg (st. andreasberg), the other side of the moutain, a fair distance away. we were all playing pool, when i wanted to come back to our rooms located in a place called the wohnhaus, which is where all the workers stayed. i went back there with my sister, and she heard a noise like a bat which got our attention and we looked around, and saw something moving behind the house. before we knew it, this huge triangular object hovered over our heads and just stayed there. we were transfixed by it for im not sure how long, my younger sister was scared, as we had no idea what it was. then it darted at incredible speeds behind the tree line of the mountain. we ran back to tell the others who thought we were seeing things and laughed at us, so they came out to see it disbeliving us, but there was nothing there, so they laughed at us even more, then we suddenly noticed it was above our heads. we hadnt even heard it, or seen it , but it was there, a huge huge spinning triangle mayby at a rough guide the size of a football pitch or bigger. it had lights all on its outside, circular lights. it seemed so close we could reach up and touch it, but we all just stood there, part scared, we went to move into the wohn house a little scared. but as if it knew where we wanted to go, it moved and hovered over our apartments. it was transfixing, it moved like something ive never seen or heard of in my life. nor had anyone else. it could change diections lie no other aircraft i know. it would dart in random directions across the skyline vanishing behind the trees, then just as quickly coming back and hovering exeactly over our heads. i couldnt see its colour, or details as it was very dark, there was no light pollution as we were in the mountains, all we could see was the lights that outlned the object. after i dont know how long, the object back tracked incredibly quickly behind the trees and we didnt see it again. we bashed around theories for what it could be, someone said it could be someone playing a trick on us in the forest, or a light display from the town the other side of the mountain. but these are both impossiple, the reasons, firstly someone has to sit somewhere high up on the mountain, deep in the forest but high enough to somehow see through the trees to the conference centre. the conference sentre itself was in a clearing in the forest, and the treeline the object vanished behind was a good distance away. in the darkness, not only would someone have to be sitting in a forset where wild boar and puma are prominent wildlife. somehow in the darkess they would have to know where we were in the dark. also lights do not make noise. this object a few times made like the ultrasound noise you can sometimes hear a bat make. as for a light show from sankt andreasberg, this too is impossible, there is no way the light would reach us, yet alone hover over our heads and know where we were, and there was no shows going on in the town of anykind. we know this was a flying object but what we dont know, we were in such a remote area who knows what it was. all we know is that it was nothing we had ever seen before. i went out on my own a few times in the hope it would come back, but i never saw it again. i wish i had seen it again i was fascinated, where i live i often see uneplained things, i always have since i was little. from ghosts to just things i cant explain. im good at sensing things. my friends think i was a cat in a former life^^ randomness. but i guess they have their reasons^^ quite often late at night i have looked over the valley from our window, and seen lights hovering in the sky. they just stay there. they could be a plane. there are a few flight paths around but not that low. they just hover, then vanish. my housemate last year was woken by a bright blue light that shone through his bedroom window and blinded him. he had no idea what it was but it scared him. theres a hill we can see from our window, next to it is the village of christchurch,2 years ago around 1am we were writing essays, and saw a light near the village we watched it for a while,it was very bright, which si what caught our attention. we watched it move into the woods next to the village where ti stayed. after a while, the light started to flash like a code, we went outside to see what it could be flashing to, to see if someone was replying to it, but ti wasnt. we watched it for awhile trying to figure out what it was. around 3am (i think) we decided to call the police, as we were worried someone may have had an accident and were flashing for help. we never ehard anything back from them,and the light still flashes to this day. though there are often more than one of them, the most ive seen is around 6 lights at once. its possibe the lights are people hunting in the woods or car headlights? probally those are more probable explanations. we did do some research intrigued by the lights in the sky, apprently we are in a ufo triangle, which stems between newport, swansea (and i cant remember the third point sorry:\\ ) sorry for this huge post, i would have posted my sitings sooner, but didnt know of this site until i happened to find a reference to it, on a site called tellmewhereonearth.com . so i apologise for such a big post. i included some images one a map of the area, one a a photo of the conference centre to show you a rough view, and the third a very bad sketch to give you a rough idea of what it looked like."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"we heard a bat like sound, and then this huge spinning triangle hovered over our
