I noticed a bright, white light in the south sky just ahead of us. It was so bright, much brighter and larger than Jupiter and originally we thought it was helicopter, then we realized that there was no way - it was too high and way too bright. It looked as if the light was a large bright flashlight shining down through a hazy lit fog. Neither of us knew what to think or had any idea what it was. It was projecting down and the bright light suddenly went dark but the hazy foggy cloud that was present below the light continued to glow for several seconds after the light went out. In a few seconds, the sky was again perfectly clear. There were no clouds in the sky and the entire event only lasted about 30 seconds. I immediately came home and started looking to see if anyone else had seen what we saw - it seems like the entire northeast witnessed this event."],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
