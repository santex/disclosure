When I take the pictures there are some times alot of them and sometimes less. I have pictures of ufos where you can see there faces and bodies of the aliens and I have 1 where the ufo looks like human heads. These things that I have taken pictures can not be seen by human, only when I look at the pictures do they show up. Dates beginning 3-8-09 and I have and will continue to take the photos each night. I am at a loss of words, the photos have been shown to my kids and my wife refuses to look at them because they freak her out."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Fairfax","There were no other sightings in Fairfax on or around March 6th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"15960","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15960.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15960_submitter_file1__Picture020.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15960_submitter_file2__100_1254.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15960_submitter_file3__Picture032.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15960.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/06/2009 12:00 UTC","Region":"Virginia","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Hoax","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"38.853794","Longitude":"-77.301343","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
