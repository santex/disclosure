{"Region":"Florida","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn my way home, back from work. I was heading west on Becker RD and made a right going north on Darwing blvd. On this street I noticed this oval shaped orange light. At first I didn't think it was anything other than a far away street orange light. Then it blinked 2 times, that caught my attention. At that moment it started moving to my right(east) very slowly, then it stopped for about 3 seconds and started going up slowly. 15 seconds later they light was off or it disappeared. I would like to mention that the skies were very clear and we had a full moon. The light re appeared not far away from where last seen and it kept going up, when it finish going up, it started heading east. I notice it had like an orange tail of light almost like a rocket. No blinking lights seen anywhere like any airplane or helicopter would have, but just a big bright orange light. I got out of my vehicle and did not hear any sound at all. This light went from my 10 o'clock to my 4 o'clock. Light just disappeared at that time."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.493611,+-80.342222(30208)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30208) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/16/2011 06:03 UTC","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval, Star-like","Summary":"Orange Light","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"07/16/2011 02:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.342222","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St Lucie","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"St Lucie","Case Number":"30208","Latitude":"27.493611","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07162011-0011","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30208.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30208.html"]}
