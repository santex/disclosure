While talking to him I noticed a bright white light moving easterly approximately over the Toutle or Green river south of my location near the cowlitz river. The light proceeded east at a leisurely pace for a little while for a (maybe 20 or 30 second)it then made a slow-sweeping right hand turn to the south and then proceeded south. It went behind a cloud bank and never came out the other side. It may have stopped, making it indistinguishable from a star as they sometimes do. It was nothing spectacular but it's the first one Ive seen in a while. I just like to share this stuff when I see it. Approximate altitude would be stratosphere, way up on the edge of space. Just one of those lights that bebops around up there."],"Log Number":"US-05022011-0011","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28912.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28912.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Toledo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Washington","Longitude":"-122.846783","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.43983,+-122.846783(28912)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28912) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/02/2011 05:22 UTC","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
