My wife and I were taking a walk before dinner when we noticed two of our nebors looking and pointing to the south of our location.It was still daylight but the sun was starting to go down. As my wife and I also looked we saw 8 to 10 bright lights, low in the sky and far off just above the beach homes south of us in the direction of the town of Buxton. The lights were bright white and twinkled a bit. The lights were not in any sort of formation but were scattered,made no noise and stayed in place the whole time.Another person driving a car pulled into his driveway and as he got out of his car said \"looks like the Air Force is messing with us again!\" laghing the whole time. We had been watching the lights for several minutes by now. We kept watching for several more minutes until very slowly the lights started fading out one by one untill all were gone. I have been going to the Outer Banks for over 20 years. There are many air bases in the area Va Beach air station,Norfolk Navel Base to name two. I have watched all sorts of fighter air craft fly over the area in my time. Some just flying up the beach others dog fighting each other while spitting out decoy flares with each turn. I am a police officer with fifteen years of obsrvation experience. Again there was no noise with these lights. They stayed lit way longer than any decoy flair that I have ever seen deployed from aircraft. Nor did they follow any flight path as if they had been. They followed no pattern and did not move or fall to earth. My wife and I have kept this to ourselves till now. We have seen simular lights on UFO shows on the tv and have allways wondered what they (our lights) may have been natural or other wise. Thank you for your help in this matter.
