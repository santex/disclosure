I knew it wasn't a plane cause planes don't go straight up. I took a picture and tryed to get a video but I was a little shaky and scared. I watched it till I could no longer see it and was scared out of my mind.I know this was a UFO sighting."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/14/2012 08:54 UTC","Summary":"was oval and came up from ground so bright saw it come threw tree line","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=61.622492,+-149.63015(43911)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43911) map </A>","Case Number":"43911","Date of the Event":"10/27/2012 07:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-11142012-0010","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-149.63015","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Wasilla","There were no other sightings in Wasilla on or around October 27th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43911.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43911.html"],"Latitude":"61.622492","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Alaska","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Wasilla","Object Shape":"Oval"}
