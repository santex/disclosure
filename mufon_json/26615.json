We had a small fire in the backyard fire pit and were sitting around it. I noticed a bright light to the north of us and watched as a plane approached. Behind the plane was an arc of 5 blue lights. The plane passed in front of the lights moving at a considerably faster speed. The lights flashed in a random manner than flashed in an organized strobe pattern moving from bottom to top, they then flashed in random order and flashed together, repeating the pattern. We watched the lights for a considerable time before they finally faded from view. There was no sound associated with the sighting. The lights were pretty, but too small to take pictures of due to light pollution. When I told my mother, who lives an hour north of us, about the sighting, she said that she had witnessed a similar object the previous week."],"Log Number":"US-11162010-0013","Object Shape":"Other","Case Number":"26615","City":"Crestview","Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"11/10/2010 07:30 UTC"}
