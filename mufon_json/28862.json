There is nothing west of us but miles and miles of fields and various farm land. I right away seen a fireball bright orangish red rising from the ground. It looked to be about 2-3 miles away. It hovered for a minute or two not getting up to high and it started moving to the northwest. This thing dwarfed any other lights in comparison even from the distance between us and the object. It was HUGE! I grabbed my camera and car keys and tried to chase it down to no avail. It starting moving way to fast. I was speeding and trying to catch it jumping from one road to another. I just wanted to get it documented. Maybe next time. We have seen it in the same spot a few times in the past year. There were four of us that witnessed it."],"Latitude":"41.008728","Case Number":"28862","City":"Chebanse","Region":"Illinois","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Chebanse","There were no other sightings in Chebanse on or around April 29th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.008728,+-87.901746(28862)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28862) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28862.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28862.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.901746","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/29/2011 09:34 UTC"}
