Around Ravenswood WV at about 1:30 am I happened to look out the window of the car and I noticed a strange set of lights in the sky. There were approximately 7 to 8 lights in a horizontal row they ranged in color from blue, green, orange, pink, red, purple and other various colors. the object wasn t moving. I looked back at the road and when I did there was a bright flash of neon blue light, it reminded me of lighting. When i looked back up the object was gone but in its place was what looked like a tear in the sky that was a neon blue, and it slowly shrank away til it vanished. I woke my wife up who had been asleep and told her I had just seen a UFO, all she said was i was crazy. I still think to this day that what I saw that night was a UFO."],"Case Number":"3338","Longitude":"-81.148714","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3338.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3338.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"West Virginia","Log Number":"","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.972334","City":"Oak Hill","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.972334,+-81.148714(3338)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3338) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Not Provided","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
