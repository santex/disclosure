I called to my husband to come quickly outside to see it. He came outside seeing the fireball and walked across the street toward the park, keeping his eyes on now 2 fireballs (side by side) and I was stationary on the deck watching the these fireballs. He now said there were 3 fireballs in a triangle (I did not see 3 - trees were in my way on the deck). He said they looked like road flare tips. He stayed in the park for about a minute or so watching until they faded out - going north. I wasn't sure what I was seeing - fireworks maybe? But it was moving very slowly horizontally - not going upward like a firework. My husband at first thought it was a flare, but it wasn't going up. We both thought this was a strange sight to see."],"Case Number":"24116","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Park Forest","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
