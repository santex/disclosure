We watched it for about 5 minutes and then the went out and it was gone. There were no blinking maker lights that you would see on airplanes since we live close to the airport and see air traffic over our house very often. It appeared to be flying higher than the normal air traffic that was taking off from the airport but lower than another airplane that was higher up in the sky with red blinking marker lights flying in the north-west direction. The sky was very clear tonight with no clouds."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","City":"Pittsburgh","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29790.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29790.html"],"Summary":"slowly flew from the north-west to south-east direction with no sound and apeared to be a bright round white light","Log Number":"US-06292011-0018","trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around June 29th 2011"]}
