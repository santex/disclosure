My home is about 13 miles from NYC. The sky was clear withno clouds. I noticed a small metallic teardrop shaped object just sitting inone place. I thought the object might be a planet or a weather balloon(considering the shape especially). I pointed it out to my neighbor and he gothis binoculars. I focused the binoculars on the object for about 30 seconds. I saw a faint flash and the object was gone. I asked my neighbor if he saw theobject disappear, he told me he saw it quickly zip to the north and in the blinkof an eye the object was gone. It could have been a weather balloon, but itdidn92t move for about 10 minutes and then it shot north very quickly which rulesout a weather balloon as far as I92m concerned.I92m not sure what I saw, but I have never seen anything like it before."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around September 16th 2001"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.717773,+-74.001483(1315)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1315) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1315.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1315.html"],"City":"New York","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.717773"}
