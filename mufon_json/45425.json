There was no sound to the object or tracer or tail. It was as if a ball was being thrown from the sky. Size of the object would be comparable to a beach ball but it was in the distance from me, just really hard to tell what the size was. It was as if someone was throwing a softball from the sky."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45425.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45425.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Latitude":"38.626227","Date Submitted":"01/27/2013 01:43 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.626227,+-86.183829(45425)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45425) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/26/2013 11:50 UTC"}
