Continued trying to follow object on prat whitney road and another side road but object got too far away. Chase lasted about a half hour. Object first looked cigar shaped grey metallic and later more disc shaped with a wobbling flutter. Have several photos from beginning of sighting to the end..Incredibly strange and there were several people on i95 overpass bridged pointing and looking at object..There must have been hundreds of sightings.. hopefully there are others to confirm this report..Called local news and they said they had several calls and were interested in looking at my photos.
