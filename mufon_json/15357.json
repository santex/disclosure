We pulled out of the Chevron on S.Main st, and I610. we where heading towards university st. When we saw a bright light came through the trucks winshield. It was early and still dark even though the street lights where on and a few cars on the street. We looked up at the same time, and I saw an object that looked oval to me and it was a very very bright white light surrounding it. I said to Mike do you see that? He said ( what is that?) the object went straight over us and began accelerating to an unbelievable speed. It was under the clouds but over all the buildings, it went straight for about 5 seconds and just dissapeared. Looked like the light just blinked off, we where left speechless, I asked Mike if he saw it and he said yes, we started counting the things it couldnt be!! no strobe lights, no green or red lights, no sound, no markings nothing.. we dont know what it was but we know what it couldnt be...."],"Date Submitted":"02/05/2009 05:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15357.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15357.html"],"trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There was one other sighting in Houston on or around February 5th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Oval","Summary":"Bright white light speeding across the sky."}
