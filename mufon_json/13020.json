{"Date of the Event":"10/12/2008 03:15 UTC","City":"West Greenwich","divs":["sighting detailsi was driving on i-95 north in ri at approximately 3:30 am on 10\\12\\2008. i had one passenger in the car who also witnessed the event. we saw what looked like a blinking\\flashing white light plummet straight down from the sky. the light was much bigger than a star (maybe 5 times bigger than a star ��� it honestly looked like a light you���d see on a plane, but there was only one), and did not appear to be a meteor because there was no smoke trail or streak that we could see. the highway is lined with trees, so once it went behind the tree line we couldn���t see an impact, nor did we see a glow or fire that would possibly happen if it was a plane crash. we discussed it for a while (did you just see that?!?), and we thought it might have been a small plane that crashed ��� we were approaching west warwick ri, which is where tf greene airport is located. (as far as the airport goes ��� i travel this route often, mostly at night, and i am comfortably familiar with the planes that come and go from the airport. i have never witnessed anything that appeared to plummet before, and it was about 3:30 in the morning.) for the record, neither of us was drunk or impaired in any way. i checked the web as soon as i got home because we were convinced it was a plane crash but i couldn���t find any info. the road was pretty deserted, and the whole thing happened in maybe 5 seconds, but i���m really curious to see if anyone else saw something odd that night."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.63449","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.63449,+-71.658713(13020)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13020) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","trends":["There has been one other sighting in West Greenwich","There were no other sightings in West Greenwich on or around October 12th 2008"],"Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"blinking light dropped out of the sky","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"10/12/2008 03:15 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10122008-0008","Longitude":"-71.658713","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Rhode Island","Case Number":"13020","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13020.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13020.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Source":"MUFON"}
