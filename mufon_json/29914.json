{"Case Number":"29914","divs":["Sighting Details At a friends house in Oregon City, Oregon. sitting around a fire talking. I spotted the Big Dipper and while helping one of my friends locate it ...I saw these two very bright starlike lights ...sorta looking like one was in front of the other moving very slowly. My friend, who had had trouble locating the dipper then said 'yeah they are moving' . We, the five of us, watched as the lights sort of spiraled upward into the sky and dimmed as they appeared to go up.They seemed at one point to have a dull light connection between them. They continued to slowly rise and spiral and then dimmed to the point where we could no longer see them. The whole event was approximately 3 to 5 min. in duration. I attempted to video it on my cell phone camera but, it didnt show up."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29914.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29914.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Star-like, Other","Longitude":"-120.548701","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/03/2011 11:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.805833,+-120.548701(29914)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29914) map </A>","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Other","Latitude":"43.805833","Log Number":"US-07042011-0016","Date Submitted":"07/04/2011 04:38 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Oregon","Summary":"Looked like two large bright stars * * one in front of the other moving slowly getting brighter ..then sort of spiraling upward and dimming with dull connection between then dimming to disappearing."}
