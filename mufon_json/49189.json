Boyfriend noticed first while sitting on patio and called me to come and look at it. It moved in a horizontal line from East to South East direction. I had never seen an orange orb floating in the sky before, could not identify what this was. It disappeared behind a tree, so it must have kept moving in a south eastern direction."],"Date of the Event":"07/25/2013 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49189.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49189.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown"}
