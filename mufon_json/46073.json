(the reason i had the camera on me, was because i some how knew i would see 2 that night, i even told my friend i would get two ufo's on video)...then both just faded away.but as they moved, they seemed to be stuttering along, and wobbling. i thought they must be some secret thing we are developing (well the us, or england stole it from you) as the pilots of them were shit, i thought they cant be aliens flying them, as it does not look like the pilots inside them no how to fly them, they were not very good pilots, who ever they were. the video does not do them justice, they were a million times brighter than in the video, they were a hell of a lot bigger, and they were more white than red. but i do for some reason thing that i looked directly up, and all the sky was red???? and it was a perfectly clear night sky. the video is of what i had taken, they were not balloons, chinese lanterns or any other kind of aircraft, i know what i saw, and it shit me up! i thought i would be ok, and cool to see some thing like this, trust me, when it happens, it ***** you up. yes i was shouting as loud as i could, and sounding like a dick (i was scared) but for some reason, i got the feeling that they meant me no harm at all, and that they were looking out for me???? anyway, if they are alien craft, we would not stand a chance if they became hostile, no military on this planet could defeat them."],"Date of the Event":"06/26/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Unknown"}
