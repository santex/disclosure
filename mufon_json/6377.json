First though he was seeing an airplane but realized it was too large and hovering, blotting out a huge area of the sky. The object had a red, green and BLUE light, each to a corner. The lights seperated and traveled in different directions only to rejoin moments later. It then \"just left\". Whitness is very vague on its departure. He first said it vanished, then added it moved away and was gone. No sound was heard, no smells. The witness is an educator with degrees from Harvard, Columbia and U.of Maine. He is fascinated and curious as to what it was. This is witnesses third sighting in three years. He only wanted to file reports on this, the most important."],"Region":"New Hampshire","Log Number":"US-02142007-0004","Date of the Event":"07/31/2004 09:00 UTC","Longitude":"-71.532472","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Source":"MUFON","City":"Concord","Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.209717,+-71.532472(6377)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6377) map </A>","Summary":"Extremely large triangular object, lights on each corner, lights seperated spread apart, rejoined, disappeared","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"6377","Latitude":"43.209717","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Concord","There were no other sightings in Concord on or around July 31st 2004"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/31/2004 09:00 UTC"}
