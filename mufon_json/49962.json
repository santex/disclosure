Never moved but had random flashes. Was not a star plane or satelite","divs":["Sighting DetailsI live across from my parents house. We were watching the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos pre season game. At the end of the 3rd quarter I went to my house to get a bottle of water. When walking back I noticed this light to the west flashing randomly. I thought it was a plane at first with the red and green flashing lights. It was to bright to be a star and it wasn't moving. I watched it for about 10 minutes and it didn't move and I noticed other colors flashing. I am very familiar with aircraft lights. I use to be a Helicopter mechanic in the U.S. Marines. I showed my dad and we watched it for a while. I got a pair of binoculars and we watched it change colors over and over flashing in a random pattern. Aircraft lights are very steady. After the game was over the light was still there. The object was very far away and my phone wouldn't pick it up. I got out my Nikon D90 and put it on a tri pod and recorded it for a little bit. The object never moved after about 2 hours. I had to call it a night so I stopped watching it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Bloomfield","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08182013-0007","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.696382,+-108.056487(49962)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49962) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/18/2013 02:21 UTC","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"08/17/2013 11:30 UTC"}
