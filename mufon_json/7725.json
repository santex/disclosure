eve 1999\\2000, my wife and i went down to the mall in washington dc. the mall, being the area surrounding the washington monument more or less. there was a huge celebration planned for that night, featuring a concert with many big stars singing. all kinds of vendors and stands, and of course fireworks at midnight to usher in the new millennium. personally i thought it was very very cold that night, i remember my wife and i stating this several times that night. although i don���t know what the official temp was i���ve heard several conflicting reports, so i have to go with the opinion of my frozen nose and toes���it was cold.. we arrived at the mall area by metro line roughly about 10:30pm and began walking around taking in some of the sights and searching for a good spot to stay where we could see the fireworks. we did manage to catch some of celine dion's act as we went past where the concert was being held, but the entire area was packed full of people and getting anywhere near the stage was hopeless. the mood of the crowd was generally happy, plenty of drinking and partying going on everywhere and only one instance of \"violence\" occurred that we noticed. anyway, there was a huge line waiting to get into the area near the reflecting pool and the police were searching people one by one for weapons and such. which i suppose was a respectable idea--but not a very efficient one to say the least. the police had erected a 4-foot high orange plastic fence all over to divide areas on the mall. a flimsy type of fence that you might see at a construction site to help control erosion. my wife and i waited in this line for about 20 minutes and still had not moved and had noticed everyone complaining about the cold and how slow the police were in searching people. suddenly we heard a rather loud ripping sound, then the sound of people cheering and police yelling through bullhorns--for a minute we did not understand what was going on, but then like fans at a ball game doing \"the wave\", we could see everyone, and i mean everyone, tearing the fence down and storming out onto the area behind the short fence onto the reflecting pool where already many people already were watching the concert unfolding. at this point naturally, the police threw up there hands in frustration and walked to there squad cars not even attempting to stop anyone--i assume for fear of a riot. even though things got crazy for a few minutes, all in all as far as i know no one was injured and it seemed everyone was having a great time and surely had a memorable night. my wife and i continued to walk on and finally decided to stop near a bridge to watch the fireworks. as we waited for midnight we talked together about things that we had endured over the past year and kind of had an \"overlook\" at our lives to date; it was a very surreal (?) moment, as if time had stopped, i guess it was just one of those strange moments two people in love might have--enough of my reminiscing on to the events that undoubtedly changed me forever. midnight, on the dot, a thousand screaming streaks of sparkling chaos erupted up into the freezing sky and blossomed into a maelstrom of intense fire of muti-faceted colors. the fireworks display was one of the best i had ever seen in the many years of my dc habitation--witness to over 20 years worth of fourth of july���s down on the mall, to this day i still say it was the best display i have ever been a part of. they wondrous display of explosive mayhem lasted full steam ahead for about 15 minutes i believe. after the last streaking missile of falling embers died away in the midnight sky, my wife and i began to walk to the metro to start on our dreaded journey home, as we knew there would be mobs of people joining us as well. as we approached the metro escalator ( i believe it was the foggy bottom station) we saw a group of officers blocking the entrance stating we all had to wait as even the train operators had been given permission to come topside to watch the fireworks and were currently enroute back to the trains to take us all home. i later found out that there were over 1 million people that attended the celebration on the mall that night--i cannot put into words how many people that is when you are right in the middle of such a huge mass of humans. again we waited in the cold night, and people began to huddle together for warmth which really surprised me--people were very happy and helping each other, i must say i am a cynical person, skeptical, and sometimes dare i say bitter--sometimes my faith in humanity is somewhat jaded. that night shocked me and actually gave me a sliver of hope that one day it could be possible for mankind to be able to call one another brother. as everyone talked while waiting for the police to let us down into the subway tunnels, my attention was called to a young man who had plenty to drink that night no doubt, who climbed a small tree nearby and was singing and generally making people laugh at his antics. suddenly i heard a loud snap, i turned back to the man in the tree just in time to see the branch he was standing on break and he plummeted to the ground with a thud. he was helped back up and he cheered and the entire crowed laughed even more. that���s when i saw it. i saw...a blimp...yes it must be a blimp. then i notice people pointing, just a few at first, then more and more, and a hush fell over the crowd. the silence and quiet mumbling between people was a sign i decided, as all night the roar of the crowd had been constant. i looked back at this \"blimp\" i had seen in the distance. more and more people were pointing and now a few people shouted like the grade school game of \"telephone\" as the message was carried off through the crowd \"look at that! what is that!?\" then i noticed 2 more \"blimps\" identical to the first. all three were cylindrical in shape and had several lights shining on them. one of them shone a very bright \"spotlight\" down on the ground. i could not see what it was shining on, as they were some distance away from my wife and i--perhaps 300 yards? maybe more. these \"blimps\" were traveling slowly across the sky and they were quite large, i���m a bit afraid to guess how large because they were far from us and i don���t remember a reference point--it was a bit exciting and i was not thinking about \"measure the size--is this north over here? what is the relative speed estimation etc\" i was in a speechless state. the next thing i saw was someone pointing up and screaming \"look up there!\", i saw about 20 triangle shaped \"aircraft\" flying in a mass like a group of gnats on a hot summer day--yet these things were very quick and nimble. each had 3 lights on them, one in the middle and one on each tip. as my wife and i watched they began to fly in different patterns. people began to call out things, such as, \"those are seagulls not ufo's\" and i was thinking to myself they were stunt kites. i even remember my wife turning to me and asking what i thought they were, and i told her they were just stunt kites and told her i had seen them before at the beach. suddenly the objects began flying in a tight circle very fast and then shot out at incredible speed and disappeared. then about 2 seconds later they flew right back into the circle pattern facing each other and stopped, hovered for a second then formed two groups each group in a line, they formed the line two at a time, one from each group until they were all in a straight line facing each other began to zigzag across each other. at that moment i knew i was not witnessing stunt kites. i was amazed. people had cheered after each little stunt that was performed. the objects were very close and i would say roughly about 100' up above us. it was the most amazing thing i had ever seen. as far as i know, no country in the world has an aircraft that can move at those incredible speeds, stop on a dime, and be so graceful. i have seen the blue angels fly when i was a kid, they are graceful, but even a fighter jet needs some room to build up speed--whatever it was that i witnessed that night did not need any room at all--it achieved tremendous speeds from a dead stop. after about 5 minutes even the police were watching these crafts flying--they suddenly started ushering people down into the subway, but they continued to watch. every now and then a craft would swoop down within i would estimate 20 feet of the ground and that seemed to make the police really nervous. for some reason my wife and i started laughing hysterically. a few young ���college ���aged��� guys walked over to where these craft were swooping down to and one guy reached his hand up as high as he could to try and touch one as they came streaming down towards the ground. after about 3 ���crafts��� swooping down, the guy turned and starting ���whooping��� to his friends and ���flexing������he had actually touched one of them! then 4 or 5 police officers that where next to the subway escalators started yelling loudly at the guys ���get back now! get away from there!��� my wife and i also commented on how the police were frozen in place and not moving from there ���safe��� distance, hehe. but then suddenly one officer did in fact, run over and grab the one, obviously drunk kid, and pull him away-- at the same time pushing his few friends back into the crowd as well. when they came close to us again, my wife grabbed the police officer and asked\\yelled(as it was relatively loud)��� what are those things?���. when the officer turned to my wife i got frightened for a second, his eyes were so big, it was obvious to me he was terrified, all he could say was ���i���i don���t know miss, please, everyone needs to leave the area immediately!��� and then proceeded to start yelling to the crowd telling them to disperse immediately. then i really got a scare, the craft started to dart into different directions very close to the edges of the crowd, then shot back up into the area above the crowd again and continued circling. i feel i must also note that when they did their dives and swoops, you could hear the crafts traveling through the air���like the actual wind resistance. similar to swinging a baseball bat or a stick -how you can hear it ���swoosh��� through the air. other then that noise, we did not hear any sort of motor of electrical noise of any sort. when one of the craft came down it swooped down about a foot off the ground then shot up at an angle to about 4 feet high and stopped, right in front of the crowd edge where my wife and i were (among thousands of others mind you) for approximately 1 second, before flipping over itself up and back into the formation above the crowd again. at that moment i thought for sure i was going to be hit by a ufo at one million miles an hour! but it stopped about 2 feet from me���i could feel the air from it. i could see right inside at the pilot���. (my wife an i compared notes later on without telling each other���instead we told her grandparents separately and then all sat down in the living room and her grandparents confirmed our descriptions to be the same) suddenly i heard the loudest \"boom\" and then some other explosions, i thought they were more fireworks but didn���t see anything in the sky except the ufo's. a few people had screamed when the explosion went off--i believe it was not fireworks. why? because we had just witness a good 15-20 minutes of fireworks and none of them were that loud and i didn���t hear anyone scream when the fireworks went off. from this \"assumption\\theory\" i don���t believe it was fireworks, but have no proof of what it might have been. the explosions only lasted a few seconds and then i heard a helicopter. suddenly the flying triangles disappeared.... i didn���t see if they vanished or flew away but i believe they just vanished. then i saw 3 helicopters fly by to the area where the triangles had been, but continued on there flight path, and no sooner did the helicopters disappear from sight the triangles zipped back above us from every direction and the crowd cheered. one guy next to me smiled and said in a drunken glee \"the government can���t stop our party with the aliens, they can���t even catch them!\" after about 10 minutes i noticed another strange event. a man in a business type suit came up from the subway while hordes of people were slowly going down into the subway. everyone parted for him to pass by, but he walked right into the crowd of us (remember 1 million people were here) and as he walked by my wife and i he smiled and asked \"if we were having a good time\" my wife chimed in \"yes a fantastic time, look up at the ufo's\" and she pointed at the 20 or so \"stunt craft\". the man smiled at her, looked up at them, then back at us and said, \"yes they just want to join the fun\" then he slowly continued his walk through the middle of the massive crowd saying hello to people and even shaking a few peoples hands. i watched him until he disappeared into the crowd, finding something about him a bit \"off\" whereas my wife had gone back to watch the flying triangles again. looking back now, one thing i noticed was that this man was wearing a business suit. well this is washington dc no big deal right? right. except that it���s january 1, and its freezing!!! yet the cold did not seem to bother this man at all. well, i have no proof he was anything other then a man celebrating new years, so i suppose i should just write him off as a business man who had enough drink to keep himself warm. i mean they were only 20 ufo's flying over his head and he acted like it was no big deal, just an everyday occurrence. my wife and i watched the ufo's for a total of roughly 35 minutes, and finally she began to tug at my arm and said ���maybe we should leave now?��� and so we decided that we were lucky to witness one of the most important events in all history ever, but if we froze to death it wouldn���t matter much and we wouldn���t be able to tell the story to our children one day (she was pregnant at the time),so we went home with an unbelievable story. (i cant believe more people have not come forward, there were thousands of witnesses! belial418@msn.com)"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
