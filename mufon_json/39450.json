{"divs":["Sighting DetailsStargazing With Binocs, sky mostly clear, some clouds obscuring NE horizon. Other witness mentioned possible satellite, with bright orange color. Spotted in the air coming over trees to the SW moving in a ENE direction. Time Was approx midnight June 16, 2012. Brightness of object was too extraordinary to be a satellite,apparent magnitude brighter than any other object in the sky, akin to full moon. Observed with binoc's seen not to have any strobes, or other observable details. The brightness of the orb washed out, and caused aberrations within my optics. After about 30 seconds traveling ENE it gradually changed direction towards the NE horizon pulsating slightly before diminishing in magnitude and disappearing in clouds at the Horizon after a further 30-50seconds."],"City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"CA-06182012-0021","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.262165,+-85.318944(39450)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39450) map </A>","Tags":"City","Case Number":"39450","Latitude":"51.262165","Date of the Event":"06/16/2012 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39450.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39450.html"],"Country":"Canada","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/18/2012 06:19 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":[],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Summary":"Extremely Bright orange light, from SW, moving NE, brightness diminishing","Region":"Ontario","Longitude":"-85.318944","Object Features":"Unknown"}
