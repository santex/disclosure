{"Region":"Ohio","divs":["Sighting DetailsDaughter, neice (34 years old) and I headed South on I35 toward Jefferson Twnshp and saw red glowing light hovering about 100 feet above the tree level. It wasn't moving, but periodically blinked on and off. As I drove, further up, nearing Wolf Rd. A large white blowing boulder-like shape appeared out of no where and shot down to the earth's surface at a 70 degree decline angle. All of us expected to see and hear a loud kaBOOM!!! But there was absolutely NO explosion nor visual appearance of a crash from where we could see off the highway. On Derby, heading toward Germantown Pike, there was 2nd red hovering thing spotten right above the trees. Then my daughter spotted a large object slowly approaching our direction, as we turned east (left) onto Germantown. I opened my sunroof and we slowed to a near stop as the object, diamond in shape with a circular center core and lights on each of the 4 corners of the diamond shape around the center circular object, held together by what appeared to be four pole-like parts. The space in between the exterior dimentions and the center circle appeared transparent. After we passed by, my daughter shouted that the object had broken into 3 separate objects, two of which flew in two different directions. When I turned my car around, I saw 1 light, very bright, the red light still in the distance flickering above the trees, and the two other lights that were apparently attached when flying above my car where now out of site!"],"Object Shape":"Diamond, Sphere, Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"08/29/2012 11:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-09022012-0041","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42249.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42249.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.737256,+-84.242804(42249)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42249) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.737256","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-84.242804","Case Number":"42249","City":"Dayton","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dayton","There were no other sightings in Dayton on or around August 29th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"09/02/2012 11:16 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright, Boulder-Like Object Shot from Sky, while another orange/white hovered in distance."}
