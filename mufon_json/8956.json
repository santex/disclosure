I saw thru the trees, what look like a very, very bright light. and this is what got my attention.. I drove past the trees and saw what looked like two very bright light, one on top of another, almost in an hourglass shape.. I did not notice any movement.. I do not think it was venus, or any planet, and have not seen this light or lights since. But, again, it was the vividness, brightness, that got my attention at first.. I am somewhat of a skeptic in outer-worldy beings, but this sure got me thinking.. I am 47 years old, work in radio, and have never seen anything like this before.."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"8956","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.71554,+-98.987071(8956)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8956) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"10:15:00","Latitude":"31.71554","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-98.987071"}
