{"Date Submitted":"11/30/1991 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving along to meet a friend at a movie. It was dark and it was suburbs. Stars in the sky and a clear night. I noticed what I thought might be a plane moving along the same direction and seemingly same speed as I am. It was way up in the sky. I came to a stop light and looked up. The plane stopped when I stopped. I gasped in disbelief and the object I thought was a plane bolted straight up into the sky from where I was and disappeared. I thought lots of things, but never tried to get confirmation ... I tried to talk myself out of thinking I saw what I thought I saw. I'm still a little unsure, but it just doesn't seem normal the way it all happened."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Odd Moving Star","Latitude":"39.021282","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9018.html"],"Longitude":"-98.477826","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.021282,+-98.477826(9018)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9018) map </A>","Region":"Kansas","City":"cms/tg n/a","Date of the Event":"11/30/1991 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"9018","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Log Number":"US-01182008-0026","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["there have been 3 other sightings in cms\\tg n\\a","there were no other sightings in cms\\tg n\\a on or around november 30th 1991"]}
