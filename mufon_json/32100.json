[link moved to field investigation section\\cms\\tg] i apologize for using this video without permission, but this seems to be precisely what i witnessed although there were never, in my case, two objects visible in the sky at once. the atmospheric conditions for visibility, apart from the clouds which were spaced considerable distances apart, was crystal clear."],"Summary":"2 silent UFOs go into clouds and don't come out","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date Submitted":"09/26/2011 11:48 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Cigar, Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.317854","Case Number":"32100","Region":"Michigan","Object Features":"Unknown"}
