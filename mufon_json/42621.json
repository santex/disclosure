Then while we were talking I started to look up at this bamboo bush I had just recently trimmed and in the corner of my eye I noticed something dark moving very subtly across the sky. And as I turned my head in reaction to this movement there it was gleaming in the sunny blue sky, a bright dark (almost holographic in appearance) luminous metallic object that stopped abruptly in response to me turning in its general direction. I caught myself being completely bewildered and while I pointed up at the sky I asked my coworker to come over and tell me what she thought this thing was? We booth stood there for a minute in astonishment, scratching our heads trying to persuade ourselves it was a plane���for what else could it be, after all it was flying in the sky. Then I think we began to come to light that it wasn���t actually flying but it was hovering: stationary in a 60��� angle from our vantage point on the ground, about 500ft up in the sky. There wasn���t a single sound being omitted from the craft and as it continued to hover above a cloud we came to the realization that it also was lacking any wings that are needed for flight. It had a smooth almost plasma like exterior surface that was practically black, but yet despite it being composed of a dark color you might associate with a shadow it was shinny and illuminating ���dark��� color that was injected even onto the cloud it was above. We only were able to see the craft from its profile and it was cigar-shape: cylindrical in appearance: and the front end of the craft had a bigger much wider circumference than the back which seemed to somewhat taper off. The craft was really streamed lined with no window and if I were to label the architecture of the craft I would say it���s very modern and ultra-futuristic in design. We booth we looking together at the strange object in the sky which also resembled what you might think a submarine looks but only this submarine was hovering up in the sky and then my coworker turned around and sat back down in her seat smoking her cigarette with her back to the ufo. I continued to watch the craft trying to make a mental image of what it looked like, and was thinking how weird and crazy this thing was up in the sky. Till finally, I turned to my coworker and asked her, ���what���s wrong with you, that���s a ufo up there, and you aren���t even looking at it.��� Then she told me she couldn���t because she was feeling dizzy and that when she was watching the ufo with me she began to see what she called ���floaters��� in her vision, and she got dizzy from them so she needed to sit down. She went on to say when she sat down with her back to the ufo and her face pointing the opposite direction the ���floater��� went away. When she told me this I felt my guts-drop because the same phenomenon she was talking about was happening to me. I had began to see a display of little tinny circles of bright golden light moving all around my field of vision I think they initially began when I called her over to me to look at this thing up in the sky. Besides they didn���t make me feel dizzy because my adrenalin was pumping and I was just blocking them out while I was viewing the strange ufo up in the sky. The little balls of light as I think back on it kind of remind me of a disco balls scattered light on a wall moving all around in front of you. Then I looked behind myself and sure thing the little balls of light were gone and when I looked back up at the ufo the little balls of light they were back. I continued to do this a couple of times and then just kept on looking at the ufo and ignoring the suspended balls of light shooting up and down and all around my field of vision; no more than two feet in front of me. As I continued to watch the ufo,suddenly it began to fade away or go into stealth mode and disappear besides this grey orb it turned into or made the rest of the ship go invisible besides the orb I was seeing. The only thing was that all those little tinny balls of light I was able to ignore before made it utterly impossible for me to continue to zero in on the ufo in the sky as it began to continue to move very slowly in an south eastwardly direction. I tried my hardest to focus in on this object but all the spinning golden balls of light shooting up and down right in front of my face made the task to hard to handle and the craft slipped off away undetected by me any further. Also about 30 minutes later I went back outside and seen a jet plane an unusual one for my area flying very quickly in the sky the same direction the ufo was heading before I lost track of it."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.765925,+-124.1519(42621)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42621) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering"}
