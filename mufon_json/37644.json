I looked at the big dipper and saw what looked like a dim star moving. I thought that maybe it was a satellite because it wasn't flashing and seemed really high up. It was whitish to blue-white and looked like a star. It traveled from the top of the big dipper to the end of the handle (West to East) where it disappeared for about a second then it reappeared for about half a second traveling the same course. It then streaked diagonally towards the south east behind my house. It looked like a shooting star and had a tail like when a light moves really fast in the dark. I got up to see if I could find it but it was gone. As far as my feelings, I was interested when I thought it was a satellite and kind of shocked when it streaked away."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/21/2012 09:25 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.321143","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Hesperia","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-04222012-0002","Latitude":"34.399368"}
