My high school friends son and I were placing garage sale sale signs on foot in that intersection, and easily noticed a perfect circle in the tall grass feild next to the road which was smashed perfectly down to the ground. I believe it was a crop circle and so does he. We naturally reported it to our families and friends, but this is my first public anouncement of it. I felt excited and reved up about it along with all the other strange extraterrestrial and paranormal happenings that happened to me that year."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
