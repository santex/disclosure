{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a Saturday evening, we were headed to our friends house for a dinner party. I was sitting in the rear passenger side of the small Nissan with my infant daughter in the middle, and my wife was driving. As we headed Northwest bound on River Rd. towards the second bend after Dodge Blvd. I was gazing towards the late evening sunset from the backseat. From the top of the side window I saw a white glowing object resembling falling meteorite or shooting star. It fell rapidly at an angle & then abruptly shot forward(in the same direction we were heading) in a straight line and disappeared. I said \"What the heck was that?!\". My wife responded \"I'm glad I'm not the only one who saw that!\" We were quite shaken and when we told our friends they believed us but did not encourage us to report it."],"Summary":"While driving to a friend's house, my wife and I witnesses a UFO.","Date Submitted":"06/29/2010 03:20 UTC","Longitude":"-110.919719","City":"Tucson","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.225923,+-110.919719(24021)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24021) map </A>","Latitude":"32.225923","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/27/2009 07:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24021.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24021.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like","Region":"Arizona","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around June 27th 2009"],"Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06292010-0002","Case Number":"24021","Source":"MUFON"}
