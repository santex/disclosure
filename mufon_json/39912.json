{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas on vacation in Mexico city for the day of independence walking around in the Main square in front of the capitol building. Taking pictures of everything. Long story short, I didnt notice anything or hear or see anything flying around when i took the pic, But when i got back home to California and went through all of my pictures, I had noticed something in the sky in one of them. Til this day I have no idea what it is and no one else does either, but I need to know what it could be.Im obsessed with this pic because I have seen a UFO before that and this time I feel I have proof by dumb luck!! Im attaching the original pic and one that is zoomed in more. Thanks for taking the time to check it out. Please let me know what you think!!"],"Date Submitted":"06/29/2012 02:21 UTC","Object Features":"Dome, Other","Country":"Mexico","Longitude":"-99.124018","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.434408,+-99.124018(39912)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39912) map </A>","City":"Mexico City","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/15/2009 01:10 UTC","Region":"Distrito Federal","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"39912","Log Number":"MX-06292012-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Picture taken of ufo but didnt notice until later","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39912.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39912.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"19.434408","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Mexico City","There were no other sightings in Mexico City on or around September 15th 2009"]}
