I was cruising at about 50mph with two vehicles in front of me as well as behind me at pretty equal distances. As I drove I noticed a very bright light in the sky up ahead, actually I remember jokingly think that since this day was my birthday that seeing an otherworldly craft would be an exceptional gift. As a proceeded down the road the object became invisible behind the trees. Seconds later it came into view to my left, it was HUGE. It was right triangle or V-shaped and it appeared to be jet black in color but with three evenly space white-blue lights which were brighter than bright car lights, but much easier on the eye. It hovered over the trees above in complete silence. I came to a complete stop to watch this thing as did the two vehicles behind and one in front. Simply amazing. These things are very real and I feel honored to have seen one."],"Region":"Connecticut","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.357927,+-72.564282(41278)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41278) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/29/2012 12:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Killingworth","There were no other sightings in Killingworth on or around July 29th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41278.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41278.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
