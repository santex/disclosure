There were 3 lights in the shape of an equilateral triangle which seemed to be at a reasonable altitude, no noise, went flying north from the south at a fairly decent speed. It was not rotating. I lost sight of it because of light pollution toward the capitol building. (I am in Memory Grove a little bit southeast of the capitol building.) There were other planes flying near the flight path of the triangular lights, but were at lower altitudes. Also, I was not able to visually see any kind of ship, only the lights. I was not able to determine if it blacked out stars behind it because of the light pollution and also because I was in sheer awe of what I was seeing."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Salt Lake City","There were no other sightings in Salt Lake City on or around April 14th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"40.765699","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04142011-0016","City":"Salt Lake City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28679.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28679.html"],"Summary":"Triangular lights float across sky","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/14/2011 11:54 UTC","Longitude":"-111.887647"}
