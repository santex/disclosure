Four seperate flashs of light","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsA very clear & cold night. No clouds. Moon at 2 o'clock position. While stargazing with 10x50 binoculars, I was looking at the Orion constelation. There are three bright double stars spaced apart evenly at an angle. At the bottom of the third set and to the left about 1mm with ruler held at arms length. What I saw was four white flashs of light. Each flash was about 30 to 45 seconds apart. The flashes were very noticeable , as if a light switch was turned on and off quickly. Each flash was as bright as a 6th magnitude star. Each flash was not in the exact same spot, but did slightly move from each previous flash. I could not have seen the flashes without binoculars. I watched for about 30 minutes longer and saw nothing else. It seemed to me to be something in orbit and not millions on miles away. I have seen many satellites pass over in the night sky. This was not passing by but staying rather stationaty."],"Date Submitted":"12/28/2009 02:09 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.462753,+-91.13337(21202)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21202) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-91.13337","Tags":"City","Case Number":"21202","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/28/2009 11:10 UTC","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Baton Rouge","There were no other sightings in Baton Rouge on or around December 28th 2009"],"Region":"Louisiana"}
