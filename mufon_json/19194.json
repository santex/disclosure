She saw an object hovering in the distance which looked like a disc in shape, but she could only see the dark outline and then she saw as she got closer she saw a red and green light on one side and the other side had a white light on it, from the angle she was at. It was not moving but just hovering at about the height of a cell phone antenna and as she traveled under orchard lake rd overpass she looked away for a split second and it was gone. She knows it wasnt a plane because none of the lights were blinking or flashing and the size was about 50ft in diameter. She looked for it in the daylight and she said nothing could of been that high hovering and looking the way it did."],"Date Submitted":"09/09/2009 08:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.484752,+-83.408932(19194)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19194) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Hovering object","Weather Factors":"Light"}
