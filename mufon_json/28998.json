I observed a bright white light with a smaller red light that moved with it as it fell. His house is located about 4 miles south-southwest of Ontario airport. I first observed the light from above his house roof line. It looked like it was in the vacinity of the Ontario airport about 1000-2000 ft high (??). It then fell straight down until it reached the roof line. It fell in about 1 second. I checked the Internet for any planes falling or anything unsual but nothing appeared until I checked Mufon and found a similar report to what I saw. The case number is 28965. Question 2: The light was brighter and a about twice the size than a planes landing lights. Question 3: Looked like a helicopter light falling straight down."],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle","Longitude":"-117.641218","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/07/2011 07:32 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/05/2011 08:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28998.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28998.html"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.065824","Summary":"White Light with smaller red light attached dropped from sky","Source":"MUFON"}
