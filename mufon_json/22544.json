I saw lots of shooting stars and they were fresh in my mind. many were hard to see and if there is much light almost imposible. i cannot verify at the moment what direction it started from but moved from right to left. it moved just like a shooting star. to be honest it could have been a shooting star, but in my mind after what i say just days earlier it seems very unlikely."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22544.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22544.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-89.334007","Case Number":"22544","Tags":"City","Region":"Wisconsin","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/16/2009 07:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Date Submitted":"03/28/2010 10:38 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.062219","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.062219,+-89.334007(22544)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22544) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","City":"Monona","Log Number":"US-03282010-0013","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO that looks like shooting star darts through lit up sky at hs football game","Country":"United States"}
