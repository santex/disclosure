I noticed a bright orange object in the southwest sky, under the clouds. I first thought it was a helicopter as it was moving at a good rate of speed from south to north. I looked in all directions around me and saw various fireworks going off, but this remained bright and steady. I watched for about 2 minutes when it took a westerly turn and went into the clouds. The light didn't flicker or pulse like an airplane light. The light was steady and almost reminded me of the light given off by a rocket or the space shuttle, which I had seen in the past. However, there was no contrail. The object made no sound."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.943511,+-82.277455(40154)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40154) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-07042012-0023","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Brandon","There were no other sightings in Brandon on or around July 4th 2012"],"Latitude":"27.943511","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.277455","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"40154","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 09:05 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/04/2012 09:24 UTC"}
