Normally we would think this was an airplane or helicopter, but this light was bigger than that and it didn't appear to be moving up, down, or sideways. During this time we were trying to figure out what it was, and within a minute I would say, the light just seemed to burn out to a single point and then vanish. We didn't come to any logical conclusion."]}
