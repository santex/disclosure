Then all of a sudden I saw a large triangle in the formation of a V flying at about 30 thousand feet. (Guesstimate) with lights from the tip of the v to the end of each tail. At first I thought it was birds flying. As it was full moon and I thought that the moon light was reflecting off of the birds. But then when I got up I saw this v flying from south to North east and it was very large. I would say about 3-4 miles long. Then I knew this is a UFO, Alien ship. We have no technology to build something like this. Everynight I have been laying in the same spot but so far this flying object never returned. Does anyone have any idea what I have seen? Hope to hear from you. Perry"]}
