I said to my wife would you look at this it,s weird. There,s no sound at all and ,no fuel trail lines in the sky behind it like a plane, I think it's a UFO. She tried to take a picture with her camera phone, but couldn't get it in frame. My neighbors were trying to figure out what we were seeing right in front of us in broad daylight!! It was mooveing pretty slow so m y neighbor went in her home and retrieved her binoculars.It was shaped like a short fat misslie with 2 large circular lights beneath it. We watched it travel fron east to west until it was no longer visible. About five minutes later it returned heading from the east to west. Today (June 23 2011 about 3:10pm )we witness 3 or more military choppers flying the same directions as if they were tracking something in the air.They flew back and forth for about about 45 minutes."],"Date of the Event":"06/22/2011 07:25 UTC"}
