{"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08182009-0015","Case Number":"18736","Summary":"Metalic silver, cigar shaped, port holes suspended in air unknown date 1955-56.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn 1955-56 in Las Vegas Nev. During the day time,day and month unknown I was in my car with my two children. My one son remarked 'what is that in the sky?\" As I was just driving out of my driveway I stopped and got out to watch. It was perhaps 150ft. suspended in the air. It was silver slightly metalic with port holes ( How many ? ) perhaps 4-6. After a few minutes it went straight up and to the right. I do not know what month but it was written up the next day quoting a neighbor seeing it and of course ridiculing him. I don't know if you are interested in this story after such a long time but I have never forgotten it. I think I am a well grounded person and now 83 years old and still have my marbles (I think.) I wonder if there is some way to go thru the Las Vegas newspaper in those years but perhaps it would be too many pages to look at. If I remember correctly in was on the front page. I hope someone lets me know if I have been of any help at all. P.S.
