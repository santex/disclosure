{"Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Log Number":"US-08272010-0012","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsI stepped out into the backyard at 1030pm AZ time on wednesday Aug 25th. my wife followed. After a few minutes she said 'what the heck is that?\" and i looked over at the mountain range up at about 45 degrees to see 5 slightly yellow lights in the night sky just above the mountain line but much farther out, the color tone of white looked similar to an old street lamp. They were in a row from east to west almost directly. but they were lined in a slight arch. They weren't just glowing, but very powerful more like spotlights and looked like what a stop light would look like about 150 yards away. But they seemed far away, perhaps 10 miles straight east of san tan valley at the foothills of the superstitions? or at least somewhere in the desert between that and johnson ranch. we both just stared for about 10 seconds and they didn't move or flicker. Then they slowly all started moving toward the center light and the second they all hit the center light it all went dark."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"5 stationary spotlights in sky. Stationary for 10 seconds then slowly merged together into one and dissapeared.","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Queen Creek","There were no other sightings in Queen Creek on or around August 25th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"08/25/2010 10:30 UTC","Case Number":"25204","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25204.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25204.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/27/2010 07:14 UTC","Longitude":"-111.624829","Region":"Arizona","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Queen Creek","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.251104,+-111.624829(25204)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25204) map </A>","Latitude":"33.251104","Disposition":"Unknown"}
