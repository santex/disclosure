It was a rectangular orange light with a white center. Approxamately 30-40 feet in diameter that made no sound at all. Nobody could make out a shape , other than an Orangish light that made no sound. It was observed by any number of people that were at the Old Settlers Festival in Driftwood. We talked to several others that were in different parts of the campground that saw it and they were all mistified as to what it was . There were 6 of us in our camp that saw it , two of us are pilots. This light had no red or green wing lights nor any anti-collision lights that you would see on an airplane at night. It moved away about 7 miles in less than a minute then just blinked out. 15 minutes later it came back out of the West and made a turn and then moved away again to the west at the same speed(200+mph) and once again just blinked out of sight. I am an airplane buff and proudly can identify any aircraft that I see ,but this was nothing that I or anybody else could indentify."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.977269,+-99.893213(46908)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46908) map </A>","Latitude":"31.977269","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-99.893213","Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"04/22/2013 05:32 UTC"}
