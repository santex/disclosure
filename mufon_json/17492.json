It was a clear cloudless night with no moon up. We were looking north toward the Big Dipper and we both noticed a star-like object moving from the south-to-north sky. It was not a plane as there was no strobe light nor navigation lights. It resemebled a dot (star-like) moving quickly through the sky. My friend said it changed colors, but I didn't view the color change. A few moments later another object flew the same path as the previous object. About 10 mintues later I witnessed another anomaly, TWO star-like objects flying south-to-north in perfect in-line formation (one ahead of the other) at the same speed. These two were about 5-10 degrees to the west of the other two we saw. I stood and watched these until they dissapeared. The planes flying into Las Vegas and other points southwest of our area clearly had strobe lights and navigation lights. The objects we saw had none of those. Simply a star-like object"],"Summary":"Grand Canyon odd sightings.","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.050308,+-111.091621(17492)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17492) map </A>","Latitude":"34.050308","Date Submitted":"06/11/2009 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
