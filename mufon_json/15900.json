This one night which was the last time i saw it, my Daughter and her friend were getting ready to go home and me were outside and i had been telling them about it, and there it was actually coming in. It came over almost the same spot but higher up than usual and then all of a sudden 2 lights came out of the bottom of it went away from it and then took 2 separate pathes away from it at a very high speed, no noise, and the two objects both had oselating lights. it reminded me of the movie the third kind by the way those 2 lights traveled one out one way and the other the other way."],"trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Roanoke","There were no other sightings in Roanoke on or around January 31st 2008"],"Longitude":"-79.933747","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
