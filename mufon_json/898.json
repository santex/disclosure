Noticed a very bright light tomy left above a distant telephone pole. Decided to pull of into the Visteonparking lot. Rolled down drivers window, took out camcorder and began recordingthe object in the NE sky. Traffic very noisy. Object remained in view for about10 minutes. Object slowly moved to my right (south) and downward. The sun hadjust risen at 6:45. Went back to exact spot on Oct 19 and video taped the samearea at about noon for a daylight reference and to determine distances to knownobjects and sizes. Todd Lemire of Michigan Mufon has a copy of the video with nosound on a CD."]}
