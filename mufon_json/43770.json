Realized that one of them was a commercial jet (flight path to San Antonio). As I was continuing to drive I kept observing the stars and realized that one had a cluster of paired lights within a triangular shape. It was moving slowly from east to west. I was dring in opposite direction of the object. I first thought it was man made, but the triangle shape had me questioning that."]}
