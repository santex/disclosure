Towards Twin Peaks Rd. in Marana Arizona. A suburb of Tucson. When the 6 redish-orange lights caught our attention right away. The first 3 appeared in a line which makes me think of a possible V shape. Than the Next 3 appeared next to eachother. In a matter of 5 seconds they seemed to be spinning upside down, after a half rotation they begun to turn off one by one in the same order they appeared. I have much interest in UFO's as ive come to find they are very common in Tucson. I have seen things before that have made me wonder what they could be. This sighting left me with no doubt it was NOT a man made aircraft of any citizens knowledge. This is my first report and i can only hope someone else has or will see something of this description. It gave me chills like ive never had."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48091.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48091.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/12/2013 03:46 UTC","Latitude":"32.424595","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Marana","There were no other sightings in Marana on or around June 11th 2013"],"Case Number":"48091"}
