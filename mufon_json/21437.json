It lasted about 3-5 seconds and then after a 3-5 second pause, it lit up again for about another 3-5 seconds. The skys were extremely CLEAR before and after the blue light. NO lightening storm, rain, etc. It was really strange. Immediately after the light flash my husband and I fell silent for a few seconds, as if to process it...then he yelled, \"Whoa! Did you see that?!\"...of course I had and answered, \"Uh yea...what was it?!\". We searched the sky for anything else unusual and found nothing??? Our 6 yr old son was asleep in the back seat and didn't witness it. We didn't see anything else unusual after that...but thought it was strange enough to mention to \"someone\"???"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Latitude":"29.786815","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Katy","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Katy","There were no other sightings in Katy on or around December 24th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-01112010-0005","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21437.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21437.html"],"Case Number":"21437","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
