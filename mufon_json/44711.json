We were driving late at 2am, clouds only around it, moon is half phase tonight, this was over a mile wide, small clouds scattered, illumination from around it was massive, the several lights at bottom seemed to make a line across bottom. It lite up the whole sky, mostly around and down. Someone else HAD to see this. I was in Bastrop Tx, it had to be over Ceder Creek Tx or near Air Port of Austin Tx. I saw it due to the amount of light, couldn't not notice it. My husband and I both knew this was not normal, 1st thing home, look up moon phase. Ok, not it, we went back out in car, gone at 3am.
