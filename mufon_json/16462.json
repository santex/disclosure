It was on in place of countdown with Kieth Olberman. It was recorded on my cable box. I noticed during an interview with David Smith, who appeared to be live from Washington DC, something bright come into and out of frame that was defintily moving. I replayed it a few times, when David Smith is talking, about 52 minutes into the program, in the upper right hand of the screen, something comes into view, very bright and moving, the seems to fade out. David Smiths is talking about the Supreme Court as it happens. I think this should be available from any rebroadcast of this show, as most are all recoreded. This may have been a small aircraft, but with the capitol building in the background, I wouldn't think so. Don"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04092009-0013"}
