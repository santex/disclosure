again last week on the 14th i saw the same shaped object again as i was driving north in i-5, i can't recall if i saw it in the same area of sky but it seemed to be in the sky around del mar\\solana beach area... again it was not moving and disappeared after a few miles. i know for 100% that it was not a cloud formation, as the outline was very clearly defined in my eyes. it was also a relatively nice day with blue skies, this is what caught my eye in the first place - the white shape outlined but the blue sky. the first time i saw it i was curious and surprised, as it was very unusual to me - sadly i can't recall the exact date. the second time i was like no way there it is again!! and tried not to take my eyes off it, but as i was driving on the freeway had to be careful also. i mentioned it over the phone to my brother also because i wanted to see what he thought it might of been. it wasn't until i read on (url remove to fi box) cms 09\\20\\11 00:19 cst flg about the notre dame game being disrupted by an almost identical object sighted & then again this article - [link moved to additional evidence section\\cms\\tg] - that made me want to contribute what i have seen in this area recently. i have never before seen anything like this, and although i believe we cannot be the only intelligent life in the universe have never actively read or researched \"ufo\" sightings. unless this was some kind of secret military machine i know exactly what i saw was not normal. i am of sound mind, body & vision. i hope this helps to add to your sightings & research. similar to this video (which was also filmed in san diego county) only what i witnessed was in the sky for longer period of time & the shape was more pronounced with the two triangular 'peaks' (not seen in this clip but wanted to portray the contrast of white\\blue)- [link moved to additional evidence section\\cms\\tg] uploaded picture below doesn't quite depict what i saw, but again is general idea again. **for question also in the area - i have checked helicopter, planes & balloons because although i did not see any of these on the days in question, they are known to be active in that area as a matter of course."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"32.973838","Summary":"Have twice observed white craft-like object hovering in the sky whilst driving north on I-5 between Del Mar & Carlsbad","Longitude":"-117.250611","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"09/20/2011 12:56 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.973838,+-117.250611(31945)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31945) map </A>","City":"Del Mar","Object Features":"Louvres","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Del Mar","There were no other sightings in Del Mar on or around September 14th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle, Other","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"31945"}
