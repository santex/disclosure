I always look up in the sky at night since I take astronomy, so I know what stars Im nearby I by the lil dipper. So I look and I saw a strange red dot mix with gold light, it went in a slanted line, I yelled to who ever was near by and said \"hey do you see that'? This guy asked what and I pointed to the sky and he and I just stared and said \"oh sh*t\" what is that? I thought it would be a shooting star but it didnt have a tail and I know that for a fact. Since it was a red dot going into a slanted direction, i could only think it was a UFO. I live over here in Queens Villiage by hempsted so the sky over here is clear. I was just shocked that I saw this last night"],"Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 10:37 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Jamaica","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Jamaica","There were no other sightings in Jamaica on or around June 23rd 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.722041","Log Number":"US-06242012-0026"}
