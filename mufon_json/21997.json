{"Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe are unsure whether this occurrence has anything to do with an extraterrestrial event, however an extremely loud boom took place at 1:50 PM that was heard and felt throughout the town of Potsdam, NY as well as the various surrounding areas within at least a ten mile radius. It was felt by practically every person in Potsdam; it rattled windows, shook entire houses and buildings, and has mystified all who have addressed it. No evidence supporting a geologic explanation has been found. At the time of the boom I was taking a historical geology lab test and we were all distracted by a loud noise and felt the entire room shake. We were in a ground level classroom with a metal ceiling."],"Region":"New York","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.6709,+-74.978508(21997)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21997) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-74.978508","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Potsdam","There were no other sightings in Potsdam on or around February 23rd 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02242010-0001","Latitude":"44.6709","Date Submitted":"02/24/2010 12:19 UTC","Case Number":"21997","Date of the Event":"02/23/2010 01:50 UTC","Summary":"Unexplained Enormous Boom","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21997.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21997.html"],"City":"Potsdam","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
