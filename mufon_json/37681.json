I ran upstairs to wake up my parents and get a better view from their balcony window and the object was stil stationary and another red light appeared as if from nowhere and they both shot off to the east out of sight."],"Region":"","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"red light when got closer could see it was a disc. ascended and descended very quickly and shot off to the east","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
