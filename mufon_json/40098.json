I watched for a few minutes. At first I thought it was a contrail from a jet reflecting the sun, but it seemed to bright and the movement seemed to slow. It came from the direction of the sunset, but slightly north and traveled in a southerly direction. I could not determine what it was. At 8:34PM, I went in to the house and grabbed my iphone. I was able to obtain 13 pictures as it traveled through the sky until it disappeared at 8:40 PM. Just as it disappeared I noticed another object in the sky at 8:42 PM coming from the exact same location and traveling the identical path as the first. I was able to take 13 pictures before it disappeared at 8:43. It traveled a shorter distance before it disappeared out of sight. Both objects look similar in shape and size, traveled the same identical path and seemed to emit a red color (glow) from behind."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Soulsbyville","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.978312,+-120.228929(40098)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40098) map </A>","Longitude":"-120.228929","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/02/2012 08:34 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Soulsbyville","There were no other sightings in Soulsbyville on or around July 2nd 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"2 bright objects seen over the Sierra Nevada mountains at sunse on July 2 2012.","Object Shape":"Other"}
