{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was working night shift . I had taken a cigarette break in the carpark. We have been witnessing and filming what we nicknamed \"Starballs\" since late December 2012 .So much activity a person can see and film them daily ! I carry my camera with me because of this. around 12.50am on March 5 , a large glowing flashing craft becomes visible low on the horizon toward Mt. Field direction . slowly hovers , without any sound in my general direction.Craft appears to be made of six individual glowing , flashing orbs . 2 red 2 blue 2 green . Looked almost manmade because of this , but I was pretty sure this was something different.I have witnessed and filmed starballs stopping , hovering aimlessly , dipping swoooping and splitting apart into as many as five . have photos .Activity has intensified to the point where I am wondering what will be next .ship looks dark in the middle as though it is solid . I take 1 second time lapse photos of the object from one horizon to the other. Ship changes course through this hover .I am so excited at this point as I know I have something special .Ship moves out of view down valley in Easterly direction E .Spoke with ufo researcher several days later about it , after I plucked up enough courage . After he took my account he then informed me that they had another sighting reported that week , and went on to tell me that three glowing balls were sighted in Dodges Ferry by a man at 1 am. and that they headed past him in an easterly dir."],"Case Number":"46160","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Virginia Beach","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/05/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Cigar, Cylinder, Flash, Sphere, Star-like, Triangle, Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Virginia Beach","There were no other sightings in Virginia Beach on or around March 5th 2013"],"Log Number":"AU-03122013-0019","Summary":"large brightly coloured craft moves towards camera . made of six large flashing balls of light .shape of object morphs into other craft .two other craft become visible .","Longitude":"-76.135424","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46160.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46160.html"],"Region":"Virginia","Date Submitted":"03/12/2013 10:55 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.842629,+-76.135424(46160)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46160) map </A>","Latitude":"36.842629","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
