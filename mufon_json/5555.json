{"Longitude":"-84.553685","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn October 6, 2006, during the full harvest moon I snapped off a few pictures while taking my dog out. The sky and the moon were absolutely beautiful! At the time I was taking these photo's there was absolutely No air traffic whatsoever. Later, after I had come in and downloaded my pictures I was amazed! The lights I captured in the sky that are moving and darting in and out of the clouds and changing really took me by surprise. I have six pictures all together with these lights in them. I wish I could show them to everyone in full screen and in the order I took them because it is like watching a mini movie as you can clearly see how the lights are moving through the sky. I took these photos without flash with a Konica Minolta 12 x zoom, anti-shake digital camera. Thanks, Michelle"],"Tags":"City","City":"Lansing","Latitude":"42.737505","Region":"Michigan","Date Submitted":"10/06/2006 10:20 UTC","Case Number":"5555","Object Shape":"Disc","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.737505,+-84.553685(5555)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5555) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5555.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5555.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-10112006-0003","Date of the Event":"10/06/2006 10:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Lights in night sky moving in and out of the clouds","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Lansing","There were no other sightings in Lansing on or around October 6th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
