I don't have a camera, so took pics with my cell phone last night and they are AMAZING!!!! Zooming in and scanning around, there are, literally, hundreds of objects involved! I am on a mountaintop in NY and saw the same super bright and HUGE light (dwarfed planes passing by)..... Morphed and changed shape many times, Tons of colored orbs and weird shaped objects. Then, after about forty minutes, disappeared..... I have a lot of cell phone pics.... should I send you some? Cannot hook my phone up to PC so i will have to send directly from my phone! Oh, and two nights ago, my friend witnessed this same thing with me.... Let me know what I should do... So, I need either a cell number to send photo message via text, or an email address....."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
