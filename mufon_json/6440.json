{"divs":["Sighting Detailssimple: same as above. event was caught on video tape. my step son was outside eating when he noticed several strange looking circular \"bubble\" type objects floating in the eastern sky. At first he thought they were just birds but soon came to realize they were not. He called for me to come and take a look and after observing for a few seconds I asked him to grab the video camera which is an old vhs-c format type and we started filming at 4:40 p.m. wednesday 2-21-07. We have approx. 1(one) minute of footage. Personally I have no explanation for or opinion on what I witnessed but the objects seem to, after ascending to a certain level, burst or \"disappear\". Don't feel objects were extraterrestial in nature just a phenomenon I've personally never witnessed before. The footage is very similar to what I've seen on television concerning the sightings in Mexico around the year 1998. Unfortunately, I apologize, I do not know how to attach the video file to computer."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California","Latitude":"36.751447","City":"Fresno","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.751447,+-119.763256(6440)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6440) map </A>","Date Submitted":"02/21/2007 04:47 UTC","Summary":"several small circular \"bubble\" type objests floating rapidly in a circular motion about 45 degrees above horizon looking east","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/21/2007 04:47 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"6440","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Fresno","There were no other sightings in Fresno on or around February 21st 2007"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6440.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6440.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-119.763256","Log Number":"US-02222007-0005","Source":"MUFON"}
