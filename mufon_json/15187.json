I noticed an object in the sky,about a quarter mile away,and about one hundred feet in the air. The object was very shiney,it looked like it was chrome,and the sun was reflecting off it. At first i was very surprized. Then i figured it must have been an airplane. The object appeared to start turning,and i figured it mus be a plane. The object was getting narrow, as if it was turning away from me,then it disappeared. I was completly dumbfounded. I pulled over looking at a clear sky,trying to figure out where it could have went."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
