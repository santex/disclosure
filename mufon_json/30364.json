I noticed in the SW west sky in the direction of the Oregon coast range a light similar to a satellite and pointed it out to my wife. It was brighter than a satellite, appeared closer than one also, and was faster. It traveled from SW to NW, appearing to follow the earths curvature. After it passed the Big Dipper it paused and got brighter, almost as if it pointed it's light towards us. Similar to someone pointing a flashlight towards you. The pause was only for a second and then it appeared to fly away. Not flying away as if it flew away in the distance, but straight up, as if it went into space, faded, and then disappeared."],"Region":"Oregon","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-123.106406","City":"Banks","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Banks","There were no other sightings in Banks on or around July 26th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.628704,+-123.106406(30364)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30364) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/26/2011 10:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-07272011-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30364.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30364.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
