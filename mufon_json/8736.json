This continued for sometime during dusk (comet Kahotek-not sure of spelling-was making it closest approach to earth during this time)and from what I remember about this event I observed that it wasn't swamp gas nor anyform of aircraft known at the time(completely silent)just a bright light with no shape of any sort. This event happened more than 30 years ago and this is all I remember of it and at the time I was most impressed by the brightness and lack of any shape since the sun had just gone down but there was still enought light to see my neighborhood by as well as there was no sound to this UFO, to this day I dont have any idea what it was. This event took place in my hometown of Landis N.C."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Landis","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","City":"Landis","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/30/1972 06:00 UTC"}
