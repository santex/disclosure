In about two- threeseconds time, we watched the blue light turn white, yellow, and then dissapear,like something had entered the atmosphere and had burned up. I have seencomets, shooting stars, etc., but this was much larger, with a longer lighttrail. It was probably above 30,000, and somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean fareast of Portsmouth, N.H. What I saw reminded me of Gulf war footage as a rocketsoared horizontally across the sky. Im sure its not any alien spacecraft, butI am curious as to what the object was. Your help in figuring out thiscuriosity would be greatly appreciated. If you cant help, could you direct meto a person, or group who may have more info, or ideas to figur out what it was.
