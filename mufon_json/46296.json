A shooting star caught my eye and I watched it move across the sky. I was amazed as I seen it make a 45 degree direction change, and a couple of seconds later the star gave a small flash and was gone. I have never told anyone about this because I couldn't explain it, and the only reason I am now is because I would like an explaination. I think for years, I was scared of what the explaination could be."],"Country":"Canada","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/18/2013 10:52 UTC"}
