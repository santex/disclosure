As it approach the Vero area, and continued on a south east tragetory, it deployed its solid rocket boosters. They got brighter and then seemed to be followed by four bright lights following behind the still bright rocket. I have lived in Vero for 16 yrs and witnessed many launches from the Cape but I have never ever seen lights like this. They somehow end seemed to follow,course of delta but got brighter, all 4 lights flickering in non sequential bursts. Clearly, they were all connected as they were always equidstant to each other. Neighbors saw it aw well. It continued to seem to very slowly descend all the while following the course of the rocket. One neighbor thought it was lights on the rockets that were deployed coming descending but all 4 lights remained the same distance fro each other."],"Case Number":"49586","Date Submitted":"08/07/2013 10:18 UTC","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-08072013-0026","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.417104","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49586.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49586.html"],"Latitude":"27.626283","Date of the Event":"08/07/2013 07:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.626283,+-80.417104(49586)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49586) map </A>"}
