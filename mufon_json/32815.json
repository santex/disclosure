THIS IS AMAZING AND I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS! IT WOULD START OUT AS A WHITE ORB CONNECTED TO A RED ORB, THEN IT WOULD FORM INTO A STRUCTURE THAT WOULD CHANGE COLORS -- ALMOST BLINDING -- SUCH AS GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, AND PURPLE! I WAS ABLE TO CAPTURE THE STRUCTURE OF IT WHICH IS SIMILAR TO A SPACE-SHIP OF SOME SORT! VERY SIMILAR TO THE \"UFO CHINA\" SIGHTING THAT IS ON YOUTUBE! THIS IS A HOT-SPOT FOR UFO'S, BECAUSE I OFTEN SEE ORANGE ORBS AROUND HERE, BUT I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN ANYTHING TO THIS EXTENT BEFORE! **WATCH IN 1080P FOR MUCH BETTER QUALITY**"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"26.169609","Object Features":"Dome, Patterned Surface","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Saturn-like, Square, Rectagular, Triangle, Other, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32815.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32815.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/20/2011 09:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.2845","Date Submitted":"10/23/2011 11:19 UTC","Case Number":"32815","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Sunrise","There were no other sightings in Sunrise on or around October 20th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-10232011-0026","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
