We were setting up to get a look at the Andromeda Galaxy but clouds were blocking that portion of the sky. We therefore occupied ourselves with identifying individual stars and constellations. Suddenly I noticed a light moving across the sky from high above, proceeding north to the horizon. It appeared to be very high in altitude and moving too rapidly for a conventional aircraft. The speed, however, was far too slow to be a meteor. We are familiar with aircraft as they are constantly descending into Newark and other New York airports. The luminosity was that of an average to slightly below average star. I observed it with the binoculars and there were no lights���.just the ���star��� appearance. As I watched it, it suddenly stopped! Among the stars this was easy to see. It then proceeded forward���..zigged and zagged. Excited, I yelled to my granddaughters, ���We���ve got our first UFO!��� We watched it move toward the northern horizon as it stopped���.proceeded���.suddenly changed directions and then disappeared over the horizon to the north. Nothing man made could have made these sudden and erratic moves."],"Summary":"Star-like object moving north....stopping...instant directional change..N.J.","Region":"New Jersey","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Monroe Township","There were no other sightings in Monroe Township on or around September 15th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"09/15/2012 11:00 UTC"}
