After the plane had passed, I noticed an object that was flying erratically in no specific flight plan, almost wobbling up and down. The object changed in color in no apparent pattern from red to blue to white. The object did not fly smoothly downward or across the sky as a meteor or shooting star would. It did not look like a helicopter or other craft, and it did not make a sound. I brought my daughter to the window and she also observed this strange flying craft. It appeared orb shaped. We watched the object for approximately 3 minutes and it then disappeared from view. My daughter said that she could not believe what she saw, that it looked like a star that was moving."]}
