After a minute or two, the red light seemed to move at a very slow pace toward the southwest. It did not have any blinking lights like an aircraft. Its movement was far too slow to be an airplane and it didn���t move in the same fashion as a helicopter. We got off the freeway on the Johnson exit, thought about going home, but decided to get a better look at the light instead. So we turned around and started traveling down Johnson. We saw a mother and two children standing on the sidewalk pointing at the light. We had the windows rolled down and were going slow enough to hear them asking each other what the light could be. About a block later, we pulled over and began filming the light. The light which had been moving southwest, stopped. A few moments later, the light began traveling in the opposite direction at a slightly faster rate of speed. Because it was moving in the direction of our house, we thought we could get home so we could film it with a better quality video camera (the only thing we had with us was a Sony Cybershot). By the time we turned the car around and started toward home, the light had vanished. We only took our eyes off the thing for a minute or two, and then it was gone. If it continued moving at the same slow rate of speed it had been, it should still have been in the sky. We're unsure of what the thing was. In all, the sighting lasted about ten minutes or so. I'm sure many others must have seen this light. You can see the light in the clip, as well as a nearby star. Because of the low quality of the video though, it is impossible to tell what it is."],"Country":"United States"}
