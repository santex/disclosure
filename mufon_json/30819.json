It was making moves like no aircraft made by man had made before. At first I thought I was just seeing things, but as I watched it move the way it did another one seemed to appear and take my eye off that one and as I watched the other one I went back to look at the one I had seen and it was gone and no longer there. As I now watched this one it changed too and another then appeared and the same thing happened. I felt my heart race for a bit. but I then needed to get my camera so I could get a picture as I came back to get a picture the things had all gone."]}
