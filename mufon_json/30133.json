Immediately, a white light caught my eye in the sky. It was too big and too bright to be a star and it hung in the sky completely motionless as far as I know. It did not appear to move at all. After a few minutes of watching it, I finished my cigarette and went back inside my home. A few minutes later, I was curious to see if it was still there, and sure enough it was. I decided to get my camera and film it. I will attach the video to my report. I made two similar videos of it and snapped a few pictures of it. It's actually still visible as I type this. (it is 5:23 am as I type this). I know for a fact that it isn't a star because I have NEVER seen it there before and I am one to watch the skies for lights on a nightly basis. It is simply unexplainable."],"Date of the Event":"07/12/2011 04:25 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Summary":"Simple white light in sky","Log Number":"US-07122011-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"30133","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Region":"Georgia"}
