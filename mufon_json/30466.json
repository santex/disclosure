About an hour ago I watched as what appeared to be a twinkling star slowly descended over about 30 minutes time. The object got close enough for me to see it changing colors red, blue, white, yellow, & green.The lights appeared to reflect off of something above them but I couldn't see a definate structure. At first I thought it was a star but I've never seen star get this big or change colors like this. I originally seen the object to the west, then it started slowly moving north. The object is still out there RIGHT NOW! I've been seeing objects like this for about a month now in between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. They don't show up every night but have been around 4-5 nights a week! It may be explainable but I've never seen any kind of aircraft move this slow and stay airborne as well as change colors like it is. Conventional aircraft blink a red and green light but these aren't blinking, they change from one to the other without stopping or dimming. Unfortunately the digital camera I own won't pick up the lights in the sky nor will my cellphone."],"Weather Factors":"None"}
