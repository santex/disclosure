I was on the side of my house facing north, it was about 2:16pm. I grabbed my camera and started to take pictures. Upon taking the first photo, I reviewed it, and noticed something in the clouds. I began taking more photos, and noticed objects in those as well. Initially while I was taking the photos, there were no objects in the clouds. ====================================================================== Please do not post this: I have noticed this type of experience on several occasions, could it be that these objects can only be detected by infared technology, something the camera can pick up after the fact, or are these objects moving so fast we cannot see them with our naked eye. Pic 1 - Jan24_01_2007 (one object seen in the top left) Pic 2 - Jan24_02_2007 (three objects - shaped like a triangle) Pic 3 - Jan24_03_2007 (one object seen in the top left) If you wish to contact me please call my cellular phone. I do not wish to be interviewed by an investigator at this time.
