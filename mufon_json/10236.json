I had a high beam light and just playing around kept flashing it at the light ! This area had few houses and on top of a mountain, we could see car lights and the light got dimmer like it was moving up back into space. The car went by and the light came back even larger ( in the east about the half size of a dime ) bright as white as a star. It never moved for 10 to 15 min's. I kept flashing the high beam light, and the girl I was with started crying and getting upset, then it started to move but it changed from a white light to three lights ,red blue green in a tri. shape."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:23:17","Summary":"It was Like the North Star only in the east."}
