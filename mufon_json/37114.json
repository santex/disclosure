guys, what is that?\" i remained fairly calm. it was pretty exciting to realize that no one else had an explanation or idea of what it might have been - definitely one of the most surreal moments of my life!!"],"Latitude":"33.364714","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37114.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37114.html"],"trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around March 31st 2012"],"Summary":"Dim orb/lights in modified arrow formation crossed sky rapidly in straight-line path and faded away over Phoenix","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"03/31/2012 11:49 UTC","Log Number":"US-04032012-0025","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.364714,+-111.951558(37114)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37114) map </A>","Case Number":"37114","City":"Phoenix"}
