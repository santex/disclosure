(hense the keyhole surgery scars.) a few days ago the stomach swelled very badly, very very badly, and there was an area to the left of the stomach that really badly hurt to the point of being unable to sleep. i was tempted to wake my room mate to take me to the hospital, i was pacing up and down outside her room concidering it at 2am, but for some reason i changed my mind and went to bed. i'm sorry, i can't get good photos. but it's the second weird scar i've gotten. the other weird wound was about an inch and a half below the bellybutton, to the right. it was a perfect circle, raised up (like a donut) on the edges and a perfect dent\\circle wound in the middle. i seriously mean a perfect circle, i checked it. still trying to heal. it happened about two weeks ago. i noticed it during the day. i have photos of both but i need to get them off my phone. not first weird events. i had a possible abduction when i was four, other possible abductions between 5 and 10, one during a school camp when i was 13."],"Latitude":"-27.462743","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Brisbane","There were no other sightings in Brisbane on or around August 18th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12182.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12182.html"],"City":"Brisbane","Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-27.462743,+153.032652(12182)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12182) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Windy","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"AU-08232008-0005","Country":"Australia","Date of the Event":"08/18/2008 08:07 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Strange cut on stomach, another below bellybutton, lost time?","Date Submitted":"08/18/2008 08:07 UTC"}
