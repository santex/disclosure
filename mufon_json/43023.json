I noticed 2 flashing lights approaching me from the east north east at about 10 degrees above the horizon. I assumed that it was obviously either two planes or helicopters flying together in close proximatey. I watched for about 10 seconds or so and the 2 flashing lights became 5 flashing randomly in a straight \"5 inch\"\" horizontal line. This 5 light flashing only lasted a few seconds and then turned back into 2 lights flashing. The object(s) turned slowly to the south and stayed headed south until I could no longer see them. I submitted 3 previous UFO sightings to your organization and received no response on what the objects might have been. I hope to receive a response on this sighting."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"43023","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-10042012-0014","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Fountain","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Fountain","There were no other sightings in Fountain on or around October 2nd 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"10/04/2012 06:36 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/02/2012 07:55 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.719612,+-104.660894(43023)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43023) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"{dr}Random Flashing Lights"}
