Just looking up, I saw a star, none in particular....but, then...a object, as big as the star as it appeared to me, came from the star at the 8 o'clock position with a distinct line coming from the star and was sling shotted counter clock-wise towards the south. The ufo disappeared at 5 o'clock. I've didn't know what to think....maybe a ship was using the star as a sling shot, or maybe e.t.? If you can look at the star 'rasalhague' at that time period, I'd really like some answers. Thanks, Bruce ps. kinda looked like looking at a watch....where the second hand was holding a rock, then disappearing."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.160806,+-77.98524(47884)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47884) map </A>"}
