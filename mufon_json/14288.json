It looked bright and pretty low. I watched it as it flew VERY slowly over my neighborhood. I went and got my wife and she came out and watched it with me. I could not make out any shape details other than \"star like sphere\". There were many airplanes flying around as always since they tend to fly around the mountain range where I live. This was much lower than the planes and had absolutely ZERO flashing lights on it. It made no sound. My wife and I watched pretty much in awe as we have seen something similar before. Once it got probably 10 miles from my house it started to go up VERY high and eventually disappeared. Very interesting sighting and i'm interested to see if anybody else saw it."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Harrisonburg","There were no other sightings in Harrisonburg on or around December 7th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.449569,+-78.868916(14288)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14288) map </A>","Tags":"City","City":"Harrisonburg","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
