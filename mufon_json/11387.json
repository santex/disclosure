The last light that was on the side the ufo was facing me was pretty bright. Then my friend and I kept walking thinking that it was a plane or something when the object made a really weird suction like noise with a few sudden beeps, the sound was like nothing that i ever heard before and stopped us in our tracks and it also produced a slight wind and when i looked up at the object again it just vanished and was no where to be seen. The sound was the strangest and out of this world sound that i ever heard and after hearing there was no doubt that what i saw wasn't from this planet"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Object Features":"Unknown"}
