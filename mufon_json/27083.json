the car appears very ghostly as if the back of it fades and there is a image of an alien on the side of the car. the animal appears swollen for some reason and there is a circular pattern on the road next to it. this leads me to believe that something landed on the road by the animal. i have looked this images over many times and i have found unusual things about them. of course the most bizarre is the evil face that appears on the head of the animal when you zoom in on it! see my other post for that picture. the place that this event took place is about 15 minutes from my house and sometimes i drive back to this area and usually something strange occurs when i do. i am going to drive back out there tonight and i hope i see something that can help to explain what i witnessed back in 2007. all of the evidence from the accident including the car, animal, blood, glass, etc was gone hours later when i drove back to the scene of occurrence! whatever this event was it was not from earth! there are also unusual images that are embeded into the two pictures i captured that night. some appear to be human faces and possibly words. the words are very difficult to make out. a small object that is white with a red tip appears on the road by the animal. i am not sure what it is? the image of the alien on the side of the car appears to be holding something that looks like a phone. my reason for this post is to include two more images. these images are of the ufo's that appear in the sky above this occurrence. you can see different colors around the ufo's that would represent great energy and power coming form the objects! i know that the images i captured are something that is very unusual and not of things that normally occur here on earth! i saved the images on the original memory card to preserve the evidence. these images have not been edited or manipulated. the only thing done was the images were they were lightened so you can see them better. these pictures are of something very unusual and i wish that everyone knew the truth about them. i am in hopes that one day someone with photography and paranormal (ufo)investigative knowledge can help me to solve this mystery. *(wit's first name (charles) deleted -- cms\\sg)."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27083.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27083_submitter_file1__Originalimage1-1-1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27083_submitter_file2__Picture002-8.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27083_submitter_file3__Picture007-4.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27083.html"],"Date of the Event":"03/02/2007 02:15 UTC","Region":"Louisiana","City":"Boutte","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.904328,+-90.378787(27083)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27083) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12232010-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
