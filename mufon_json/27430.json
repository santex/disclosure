{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe dog woke me up at approximately 4:45 am to use the bathroom. I saw what looked like a huge star hoovering in a southeasterly direction and had 4 little lights hoovering around it. I woke up my daughter to be sure I wasn't seeing things, and her and her friend sleeping over also saw the light. It was 4 times the size of the stars in the sky and my daughter took a picture of it with her cell phone. Didn't come out very clear. We watched it move slowly up and back for around an hour until we all got tired and went back to bed. I woke up again about ten minutes ago, and its still there. Smaller now, but very bright. I am watching the news, there is nothing about it. I am suprised, because it's in plain sight right now! 6:39am - it is now gone."],"Summary":"Thin on the top thicker on bottom. All bright white light. Had 4 smaller multicolored lights circling around it.","Latitude":"39.744004","Log Number":"US-01172011-0004","Region":"Colorado","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.744004,+-104.976423(27430)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27430) map </A>","Tags":"City","Case Number":"27430","Longitude":"-104.976423","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"01/17/2011 04:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","City":"Denver","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27430.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27430.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around January 17th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"01/17/2011 08:40 UTC"}
