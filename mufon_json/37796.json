We were lying on lawn chairs star gazing. 2. The object was slowing moving in a north west direction directly over us. 3. When I first noticed it I pointed it out and we both could not figure out what it was. 4. The object was moving without sound or lights; it appeared to have a shimmer look to it, as if it was under water. It was a large V shape, like a block letter V and it moved in the direction of it's point. It was very big. 5. This was a bit scary but exciting to see something so strange. 6. We lost sight of the object because it traveled out of sight range. We could not believe what we saw; the shape was very dark and this thing was big enough to block out stars. It had definite sharp edges to it. I never thought I would see something like this in town."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"38.441957"}
