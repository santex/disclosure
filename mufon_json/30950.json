As i neared Parkway i glanced up and to my right and noticed a fast moving Bright object approximately 1-2 miles up. Object appeared to be Disc shaped and traveling at least twice as fast as a conventional jetliner. I initially thought that it was an airliner as i have seen them shine in the bright sunlight. However this object appeared to be approximately twice the size of a 747. Sun was bright and sky was deep blue. A few small thick white clouds were scattered about. The object traveled what looked to be a couple 100 yards and straight into one of these clouds. I watched for object to emerge so as to make a positive ID but the object did not emerge. I continued to observe this cloud for another 5-6 miles travel time with nothing emerging from it."],"City":"Caneyville","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/12/2011 03:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Kentucky","Latitude":"37.419821","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.419821,+-86.501577(30950)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30950) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Summary":"Silvery object (larger than conventional aircraft), dissapears behind cloud."}
