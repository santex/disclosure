I went outside to take a picture of the backyard at 10:48. There was a glare on the screen of the camera so it was hard to see the image. #2 I didn't notice the object behind the tree limbs until I transferred it on the computer. #3 I knew it wasn't a tree limb, a bird, plane, or cloud. I can't identify it, it's an object in the sky flying. That makes it a UFO."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22937.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22937_submitter_file1__DSCN0329.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22937.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.012052,+-97.083047(22937)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22937) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oklahoma","trends":[""],"Date of the Event":"04/06/2010 10:49 UTC","Latitude":"35.012052","Longitude":"-97.083047","Summary":"I didn't notice it until I put it in my pictures on the computer."}
