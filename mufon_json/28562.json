{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was with my mom,dad,and brother at the park getting ready to watch the fireworks display at the park. I was waiting a while,looked up and saw a glowing red orb floating in the sky. At firt I thought it was a chinese lantere attached to a ballon full of hellium but i noticed it movie in a sraight line and not going higher in the sky like all ballons do.It past by and went away.Thenabout 3-4 or 5 more come from the place the last orb disappeared at.I knew that those couldnt be fireworks or cinese lanterns with a light in them attached to a balloon.Theythan flickered out after awhile.I think they are ufos.No kind of fireworks go in a straight line while staying at the same altitude and not going higher or lower.Too bad no one else beleives they were ufos.Well i dont know if they do.It wasn't in the newspaper thats for sure.Im now excited to go back on july 4th to see if i can see them again.I thought i was in a ufo free place but i guess i was wrong.
