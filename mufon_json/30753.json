I was in the passanger's seat looking towards my co-worker who was driving when she made the comment, \"I can't believe it! They built a stadium to the Indians next to the freeway\". For that I turned and looked at it and didn't think much about it, to me it was just a stadium. Then a few minutes later, my co-worker started crying and started driving faster at about 90 Miles per hour. I asked what was the matter, why she was crying and made the statement that she was going to kill us driving so fast, for what she responded: \"Haven't you noticed? The stadium if following us. I turned and looked at it again, and for some strange reason, I said, \"There's nothing to be worry about, you shouldn't be afraid, nothing is going to happen\". The stadium scorted us for about 20 miles, until we met civilization. This event occurred around November or December of 1986, and I had already called my mother, who was expecting me to arrive at 8:30 p.m.(at that time cell phones were not popular), but when I got there, she was very upset because I was late. At that moment I couldn't understand why she was so upset, according to my watch, I had arrived on time. She kept telling me that I should have given her another call to let her know that I was going to be that late, so she wouldn't have to worry. It wasn't until about 10 years later that I realized we had missed about 2 hours of our time, for what we had no recollection. My co-worker made me swear that I wouldn't tell a word aobut it because she didn't want to look stupid, and I did keep my word until about 10 years ago when I was watching a show on TV about the subject and learned how people were giving their testimonies about how they had also missed some of their time and how their watches show the time they were supposed to be living in, but in reality it was about 1:30 - 2:00 hours later."],"Longitude":"-119.414132","Case Number":"30753","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Latitude":"36.784391","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","City":"Ocotillo Desert","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Summary":"It looked like a stadium was following us in the desert for about 20 miles","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.784391,+-119.414132(30753)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30753) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ocotillo Desert","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-08092011-0087","Region":"California","Object Features":"None"}
