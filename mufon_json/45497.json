No sound or anything. I though it could had been a skywriter but it sure wasnt...I studied it for 5 mintutes and lost site of it when I had to cross the kids.. I am amazed."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"28.014753","Longitude":"-82.562532","Date Submitted":"01/31/2013 01:22 UTC","trends":["There have been 105 other sightings in Tampa","There were no other sightings in Tampa on or around January 31st 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45497.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45497.html"],"Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cylinder","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.014753,+-82.562532(45497)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45497) map </A>","Country":"United States","City":"Tampa","Tags":"City","Summary":"seen a long thin whitish object moving etreamly slow across the sky","Log Number":"US-01312013-0005","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"45497","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
