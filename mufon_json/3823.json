I was standing at he railings when something that looked like a football caught my eye. It looked as if it was a soccer ball that someone had kicked over the trees. But when I expected it to land on the other side of the trees, the side I was watching from, it just seemed to hold it's altitude and move across the field in front of me. I realised that it was really silver and shiny. I just stood and watched it, (we had not got a video camera at the time), until it floated away past the motorway and ought of sight. I have told some people about the incident, but I don't think they elieved me. I hope you will."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.344104,+-6.267494(3823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3823) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"3823"}
