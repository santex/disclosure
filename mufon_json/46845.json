The sky was beautiful so I decided to take some photos. I wasn't paying much attention as my 3 year old daughter was talking to me at the time, but I had uploaded one of the pictures to my facebook page via phone. Later that night, I had taken a look at the picture I uploaded when I noticed something odd in the photo. I decided to take a look at the pictures I took (3 in total) to see if it was camera glare. I honestly, am not sure what I captured. Everyone keeps telling me it's the moon, but I am having a hard time believing this as one of the three pictures has absolutely nothing in it. The one picture looked like camera glare, until I zoomed in and noticed it was behind the clouds. Really unsure as to what I have but I thought someone could make sense of this for me.."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown"}
