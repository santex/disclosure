(5-10k ft.)and moving in a steady fast speed.(faster than any aircraft) observed looking south moving from nw to sw direction. sky was mainly clear with some light clouds to our east. no moonlight. very strange! never seen anything like it. no bullshit! would like to discuss this incident with anyone. we thought perhaps it may be a large bird or a spot light however the object did not move like a bird or a spotlight."],"Date Submitted":"09/28/2013 11:14 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Log Number":"US-09282013-0023","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"09/28/2013 10:25 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Country":"United States","City":"Osprey","Summary":"{nd} Transparent Vee shaped object","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.199561,+-82.497134(51156)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51156) map </A>","Case Number":"51156","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51156.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51156.html"],"Longitude":"-82.497134","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
