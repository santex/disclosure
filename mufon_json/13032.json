They had gone into the tent, but, it being a nice night, I decided to sit up and watch the stars for awhile. The night was very dark. So dark that I couldn't even see my hand six inches from my eyes. The stars were very brilliant, and a few minutes after watching them I noticed that some of the stars were like dancing in the sky. So I focused on them, and saw that they were like chasing one another. THen, about ten minutes later a third one came and they were all like chasing one another like in a game of tag. It was like watching a ballet dance. I called another camper to come and watch with me, which he did. After a few minutes - maybe 10 or so, he said that watyching those things make him sscared, so he went back inside his own tent. I watched these objects for at least 2 hours, maybe more, when all at once they all zoomed off at a fantastic rate of speed and vanished in a second."],"Latitude":"38.431855","Date of the Event":"09/06/2008 12:00 UTC"}
