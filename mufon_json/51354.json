It moved silently and pulsed a reddish-orange-amber light. I thought it may have been a plane, but it had no blinking lights...it just glowed. My second thought was that it might be a meteor. My friend and I both asked each other repeatedly what the f it might be. We became a little excited and watched it until it disappeared out of sight. It was not visible from the rear, only the side or the bottom, whatever part we were seeing. Not a sound."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Oval","Date Submitted":"10/07/2013 12:11 UTC"}
