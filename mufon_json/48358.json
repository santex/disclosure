Couldn't tell if they were moving at first, or if the moon was reflecting off aircraft. Stopped jogging to observe. Watched as the two lights remained in perfect formation blocking light from stars. The stars between the two lights remained visible. The speed of the lights was hard to determine; although they did not seem to be in a hurry. Started jogging again towards the west watching the two lights. My peripheral picked up another light to my left from southeast. My hair stood up all over. Three lights now, with the trailing light catching up to the first two. Looked back to the west and only saw one light; looked south and saw the third; looked back west and nothing; and when I turned south again the third light was gone."]}
