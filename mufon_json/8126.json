We were approaching Ft. Lupton or Brighton, we were just talking and I noticed that the moon was really, really red. It was just on the horizon, so we were looking at that, which is what got me looking at the sky in the first place. It was kind of cloudy and overcast, but then I noticed a break in the clouds and the clouds sort of parted and I just saw this object there, I just couldn't belive it, it was red, deep red, and sort of round, like a globe, but also slightly flat, like a squahed globe. It was definitley mechanical because you could obviously see parts that weren't like rock or anything. It was enormous. It wasn't just a tiny dock, but a huge craft. I couldn't tell exactly how big it was because again, it was in the clouds. So my friend and I stared at it, and we were like, 'Oh my god, did you see that?' I wasn't sure that I was just seeing things until my friend told me she saw it too. We were wondering why more people weren't stopping to look at it."],"Date Submitted":"11/30/1983 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Brighton","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.994692,+-104.813358(8126)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8126) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8126.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8126.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.994692","Tags":"City","Summary":"Huge, red, more round than a flat disc.","Longitude":"-104.813358"}
