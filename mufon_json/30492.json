{"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 11:15pm I let the dog out and was star gazing on my back deck. Due north of my location a bright orange sphere which initialy seemed small caught my eye. It was pulsating and suddenly grew very very large. I ran back inside my house and grabbed my camera phone and NV. I video recorded the object which seemed to hover mostly then moved north and west. The object continued to pulsate. suddenly the object drastically shrank in size. The whole event lasted a couple of minutes. After playing the video back on the computer you can see at 27 seconds into the video a bright very very fast star like flash which apprears to be shot out from the sphere. I've spotted and recorded a few ufo's in the past and reported them here. I dont know what this object was it just seemed so large. Clearly larger that a full moon looks in the sky. I'm not sure at the distance from the object it seemed close but I could be certain. If I had to guess less than a mile."],"Longitude":"-89.391518","Summary":"pulsing orange sphere changing size","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/30/2011 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/31/2011 08:09 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.635535","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.635535,+-89.391518(30492)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30492) map </A>","Case Number":"30492","Region":"Illinois","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30492.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30492.html"],"trends":[""]}
