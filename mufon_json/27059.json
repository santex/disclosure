They had six lights on them each, and the lights on both of them were bright white lights. This happened between 6:00-6:30. I was at the high school gym. I was standing on the sidewalk when my friend yelled \"what is that?!\" My first thoughts was that it was a helicopter or airplane. The objects sat there and did not move. Then after a few seconds, they disappeared. I felt a little confused and shaky during and after the sighting. I lost sight when the object's lights went off"],"Region":"Texas"}
