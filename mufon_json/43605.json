Another smaller orb emerged from it.","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 2 AM the moon was setting behind the Grand Canyon North Rim Lodge and I was on the veranda overlooking the immense blackness that is the Grand Canyon at night; all activity had ceased around and in the lodge and I was quite alone. I had been waiting for the moon to set so that I could observe the stars which I am usually deprived of living in LA. Suddenly high in the night sky a far off light flashed into my peripheral vision. It just seemed to appear out of nowhere. I turned to see a single steady light brighter than any airplane or satellite, a glowing yellow-orange orb due south over the canyon at about 40 degrees elevation moving west to east in a straight line parallel to the horizon. It continued to move slowly for about 3-4 seconds when a smaller yellow-orange orb emerged from it and moved down and away to the southwest. Then they both abruptly blinked out."],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Region":"Arizona"}
