I returned to my car, where my girlfriend and daughter were waiting, which was parked in a nearby lot. When I sat down in the car and closed the door, I immediately saw an object in the sky. The car was parked on a steep incline, and the windshield faced more towards the sky. A saucer type, oval object flew silently above us, across the horizon in a steady but not so fast linear pattern,no sound, over shops and buisnesses, heading towards a busy retail district called Trinity Center. \"What is that,?\" I said. \"Thats not a plane\" \"It's a meteorite.\" my 15 year-old daughter said. \"Does that look like a plane Hon,\" I said to my girlfriend. \"I don't know\" she said. \"That's not a helicopter\" I said. \"It's a meteorite\" my daughter said again. \"It's not a meteorite\" I said. \"That can't be a plane\" I said. \"What is that? \"I don't know\" said my girlfriend. It disappeared over a building. My first thought was that it was a model...someone was flying a model saucer disk shape toy. I only came to the realization that it wasnt a model, a plane or a helicopter after the fact, a few seconds later actually. It wasnt a lantern either. \"Holy sh*t\" I said. \"I think we just saw a UFO.\" \"what did you see?\" I asked my daughter. \"A disk,\"she said. \"It had a red light under it\" \"I saw red-orange\" I said. \"It looked like it was spinning\" My daughter said. \"That's when I could see the red light.\" \"What did you see?\" I asked my girlfriend. \"I dont know what that was\" she said. It was still fairly light out, the sun setting down for the night when we saw the UFO. Many planes travel this path as the Moncton airport is about 20 km away...they are low enough to see exactly what kind of plane they are...cargo, jet, passenger, twin engine,cesna's(the flight college is at the airport).... What we saw was none of the above. It was circular, disc shape, made no sound and travelled at a moderate speed...enough for me to observe it for about 15 seconds before it made its way over the building."],"Log Number":"CA-08072012-0034"}
