This object had 3 red lights side by side and the lights were flashing back and forth very slowly. It hovered for 5 minutes then slowly went north. It looked nothing like the airliners that were passing by. The moon was out to make everything bright, it was cold so I could see airliner vapor trails, and I could here jet sounds when they went by, but this object had no vapor trail nor did it make a sound. This is my second time reporting an object in the same area at a different time. Please know that I really try to debunk what this object was the charactersitics of the object were nothing like the airliners passing by and the round red light were very distinct."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.062723,+-121.30667(14329)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14329) map </A>","Summary":"Object with 3 red lights possibly same as WA reported ufo????","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.062723"}
