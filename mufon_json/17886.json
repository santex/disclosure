I ran in to grab my camara and got a short video of it. It was floating slowly. It appeared to be a hot-air baloon, without the balloon. There was no sound, just a floating fireball. It was dark out, so a bright ball in the sky is not normal. I had to leave for work to get in on time, so I put the camara up and got in the car, intending to further watch the object, but it was gone. It doesn't show on the video because it was so dark, but it had tenticle like objects hanging from it, and reminded me of a jellyfish. I'm a CPA, and I don't believe in things I don't see, but this was something I've never seen before, so I'd like to know what it was!"],"City":"Indianapolis","Object Shape":"Egg, Fireball","Latitude":"39.771396","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.771396,+-86.153474(17886)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17886) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date Submitted":"07/06/2009 06:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/06/2009 06:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Egg-shaped fireball floating in Indiana.","Longitude":"-86.153474","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Region":"Indiana"}
