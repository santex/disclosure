Being an amateur astronomer I did not recognize this constellation. After 20 seconds the object turned a brilliant gold and displayed reflections from the rising sun. It then vanished. I view many heavenly objects and this may have been an exploding star but due to the size, reflections, and clarity it must have been in LEO. There is no sat in this long and lat, very baffling to say the least."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-70.877275"}
