It had 5 lights on it and it made no sound and we could not see any evidence of any contrail. I would estimate that this object was fairly close to the ground, if you would place your arm straight out the object would be about the size of your thumb. We only saw it for about 30 seconds. There were hazy clouds to the east of us and a few overhead so it was hard to see a good black sky. We figure it had to be some sort of military craft. It moved on to the south and we lost sight of it after about 30 seconds because of the hazy sky."],"Date Submitted":"08/04/2010 01:06 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.02964,+-97.41687(24923)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24923) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"42.02964","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24923","Log Number":"US-08042010-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24923.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24923.html"]}
