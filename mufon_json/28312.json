I did use a flash for this particular capture. I have taken photos at night and have not had any artifacts appear in them. I would dismiss this as a reflection of some sort had it not been for an event that happened about 15 years ago in another state. A glowing, reddish orange orb flew out of the woods and came within 25 feet of where I was standing. This orb in the moon photo looks the same. Can someone tell me if it was caused by the camera?
