I read about y'all on youtube so came here to your site to tell this story, I always wondered if anyone else saw them that night and maybe reported it, I never did, and would not have known who to contact anyway, so here is my story, it may be to old to be of any interest to y'all, but thought I would tell it anyway."],"Case Number":"50751","Latitude":"31.973539","Summary":"Hovering low, saw on east side of my house first, moved and stopped 3 times then ascended and gone.","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Diamond","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","City":"Undisclosed"}
