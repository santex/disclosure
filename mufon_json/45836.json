{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.516262","divs":["Sighting DetailsI am personally not a witness to this, but someone needed to make a report here. For the past week, many residents and motorists have been claiming sightings of UFOs over Irvington, AL at night. This morning, the story was picked up and sensationalized by a local radio station (97.5 WABD) after photos started surfacing of the UFOs themselves. They were boomerang-shaped and emitting light that was described as either green, orange, or white. I have attached a digital image of the purported UFOs. There are apparently other images as well."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"02/22/2013 12:25 UTC","City":"Irvington","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Irvington","There was one other sighting in Irvington on or around February 21st 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45836.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45836.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02222013-0011","Region":"Alabama","Case Number":"45836","Summary":"A Week of UFO Sightings in Irvington, AL","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Date of the Event":"02/21/2013 08:00 UTC","Longitude":"-88.230852","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.516262,+-88.230852(45836)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45836) map </A>"}
