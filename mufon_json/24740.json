(only round) * they were pulsating in differnt colors (but no sound). * they were close enough where i could hit them easily with a stone. continuing ... as they moved towards me, i turned on my brothers police issued flashlight that he would let me use when i worked at this location (field) it was very dark and there were no street lights in that area. anyway that's how i knew there were no markings or numbers on these objects and the flashlight did not cast a reflection. they came to a complete stop directly over me for about 30 seconds, that's when i thought about picking up a rock and throwing at them. i didn't because it would have been awkward to throw at something straight-up in the air. (however they were close enough for me to do it with ease.) the next thing i knew in a flash or the blink on an eye they were gone! so i called down to hq (walkie-talkie) and reported what i just saw, and made notes in my report. minutes later the night sky was buzzing with fighter jets f-15 that i assume were scrambled from wright patterson air force base located in dayton,ohio. when i got off that morning (0600) i was called to hq to give a full report of what happened to the capt. to be honest i don't think anyone believed what i saw, so when i got home that morning my mother had made breakfast for van and i at which time i told her every detail of what happened, and i even drew her a picture. after breakfast i went to bed for several hours because i had to be back at work later that night again from 2400-0600 in the same field\\post. when i woke up for dinner that evening my mother had the local news paper (lorain journal) waiting for me at the table. on the front page was a picture of what i drew for her and several witness's testimonies. not only did i see these things but a doctor, lawyer, police officer, nurse, fireman and a few others. the only differnce between them and myself is that they saw these things from a distance, where as i saw them up close and personal. after i got out of the military i moved to atlanta,ga (south of the city) and on a few occasions have seen these things again. only not in a cluster (group) but one at a time, and i have contacted the faa (hampton center) that is near my home about this. one of my close friends is a supervisor (air traffic controler) at the hampton center but was off the night i called in to report the object. thank you! sincerely, *(wit's name deleted--sgonzalez\\cms)."]}
