Saw an object that was straight in front of me, which at first looked like a bright light that I thought was a plane heading towards me at first, but as I got closer it grew in size. There was no sound and once I got closer saw it was stationary and I then realized it was not a plane or helicopter. As I got closer, I could see some lights on its underside and I passed almost directly under it as it was off to my left partially obscured by trees but very close to the tree tops in a very thickly wooded section. The lights made its structure partially visible. It appeared to be a somewhat disc shaped object although not perfectly round and appeared to be concave on the bottom, about 30' in diameter, with a few green and red lights glowing constant underneath, it also had a bright white light that I could see as I approached it and was just above treetop level. It also looked like it had some sort of I-Beam like structure across the bottom that was flush against the concave bottom with a round structure in the very center. The trees were partially obscuring it at the closest point so I didn���t get an enormous amount of detail I was shocked when I realized what it was and was also upset because there was a car on my bumper that kept honking its horn at me ��� I must have been slowing down to look at it. I would have pulled over except for the driver on my bumper and I was also quite startled. I lost sight of it when I passed under it and kept driving. I told my wife when I got home ��� I was still startled and quite shaken about it, which actually surprised me. I have seen several UFO���s in the distant past but nothing this close where I could make out the structure of the craft in any kind of detail. My wife and I drove back to the area which is close to our home about 15-20 minutes later with a camera and flashlight but saw nothing."],"Longitude":"-84.314064","Date of the Event":"09/11/2012 09:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Egg","Case Number":"42517","City":"Loveland","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Loveland","There were no other sightings in Loveland on or around September 11th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-09122012-0021","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.217188,+-84.314064(42517)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42517) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"09/12/2012 10:42 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42517.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42517.html"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"Ohio","Summary":"Saw bright object in sky as I was driving, was smaller and became larger as I got closer, straight ahead of my car just above treetop level.
