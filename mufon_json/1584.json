{"divs":["sighting details travelling west on bell road approaching tatumblvd. intersection when i noticed a bright light kinda similar to a searchlight, but stead and not moving. at first i thought it was a police helicopter(1 or 2 as large and very bright) as news reported looking for a burglar. thought they must be searcing that area. the light kinda faned out or got widerfrom top to bottomonly can think of search light as comparison. it was kinda near the arizonapublic service electric company office where they have trucks stored in back andi dont know what else. the light kinda indicated somebody\\something was beinglooked for. as i went through intersection, i looked away and then looked back. when i looked back light was gone and there was like cloud of smoke whichslowly dissipated...nothing there. i looked all over for some type of plane butthere was nothing there. in the past i have seen bright, broad bands of lightin the sky which seemed to disappear the minute i see them. they usually gohorizontally from start to finish very quickly. im always looking for ufos. so far, i have only seen lights."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.456297,+-112.066077(1584)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1584) map </A>","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around March 15th 2002"],"Latitude":"33.456297","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"","Longitude":"-112.066077","Summary":"Bright search light","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/15/2002 06:00 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"03/15/2002 06:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Phoenix","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1584.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1584.html"],"Case Number":"1584","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
