{"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"04/11/2010 09:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Romulus","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside smoking a cigarette and was looking into the sky when i observed what appeared to be a very bright star somewhat low to the ground (aprox. 1000 ft). Upon watching it for a minute the bright object dimmed to almost no light what so ever, at this point it has my full attention. As i continued to watch it moved like no aircraft i have ever seen going vertical and horizontal at incredible rates of speed. It also was flickering odd colors of light, I continued to watch until it faded into the distance when i came inside and Googled \"UFO sightings in Michigan\" and found this site i hope i can receive some sort of explanation for this occurrence.
