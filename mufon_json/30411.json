{"Date Submitted":"08/10/2011 06:16 UTC","divs":["Sighting Details I was in the laundry room of the apt complex that I lived in. I ran back towards my apt, when I stopped. I had an overwhelming feeling that I was not alone. I looked around and then looked up and saw this oval shape disk, hovering about 60 feet above me. It made a low humming sound. Stationary. It was Metallic and luminating a blue light around it. It had three huge lights in a triangle pattern, three ventalation units and a cylinder shape in the middle. No screws, bolts or anything manmade did I see. It was magnifcent!! Beautiful! After a few minutes it slowly ascended into the night sky. Then it picked up an amazing amount of speed in the same path. Upwards into the sky. It stopped and shot off to the west. I thought while observing the craft that the humanity of this race are of high intelligence. Amazed with this beautiful design of this craft. I had static electricity(for a week)everytime I picked something up. Nasa sent out a calling card years ago. What are we going to do to welcome them here. Thank you."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08102011-0032","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Latitude":"33.013804","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30411.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30411.html"],"Case Number":"30411","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"South Carolina","Date of the Event":"02/28/1978 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Hovered over me.
