Clear skies and daylight. On the horizon, not far away, i saw an object clearing the trees and comming toward me. It was shaped like a disc, but with a \"handle\" protruding from it. Like a frying pan. It was brown in color and moving VERY slowly. I immeadiately knew that I had no idea what this was. The only guess I had was a soaring bird. However, that thought certainly didn't last. Perhaps4-6 mph. It's course lead it DIRECTLY over my head. 100' up. It was COMPLETELY silent and totaly straight. I can't emphisize this part enough. It didn't go up, down, left, right...nothing. TOTALY straight. It was not a large object. About the size of a car hood. I used me cell phone to call a coworker inside. He came outside and witnessed this as well. The object was brown and featureless. It disappeared over the other horizon and was in my view for 3-4 minutes and for a distance of 600 yards or so."],"trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Birmingham","There were no other sightings in Birmingham on or around February 27th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.522341,+-86.79843(16108)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16108) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-86.79843","Date of the Event":"02/27/2009 01:00 UTC"}
