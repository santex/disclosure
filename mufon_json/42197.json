But the object di dnot move and was very bright -- too bright for it to be just a reflection from our sun. Second thought was that it was a weather balloon, but that did not make sesne over the middle of a city of 4 million. Also, upper winds are from the south and the object was stationary. Very bright, very small -- I wondered if it was a military hovering communications thing or something. But still, at 5:30 over a city? ftre a short while I wondered about a second sun or supernova(sp?). THAT would be interesting. But what promptes me to write this report is that the object is mocing in tandem with the setting sun (the way a planet does): in other words, it may be outside and beyond Earth's realm. It really is quite bright. If you hold a fist out at arms length, the object is three or four fists higher tha the sun alonfg the sun's recent path. It seems to on a similar trajectory. Took a picture but it's just a little dot. If you're out West go have a look! I've seen it now for almost an hour. Should be quite the sight shortly after the sun sets."],"Object Features":"None","Case Number":"42197","Summary":"Like a pin point second sun traversing sky in tandem to our sun.
