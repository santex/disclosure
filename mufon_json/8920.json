I happened to look out the window up to (the southern sky) and I saw what looked like a very bright star and thought it strange it was so bright this morning. It seemed much closer than a normal star. It was still dark outside and the night sky was dark but seemed clear from my view point. Suddenly the object changed to a triangular shape, like a florescent light with the middle empty. It became brighter for a second and then just began to fade out completely and was gone. All this happended in the span of about fifteen second or lesss. It did not return and I waited, even did a mental thought message requesting a repeat, but no go. The object did not move it was still during the whole event. The event was so strange as i normally look out my bedroom window to the sky and am familiar with the night sky in my area. SO THAT IS IT FOR MY FIRST UFO SIGHTING. IT WAS AWSOME."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"01/16/2008 05:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.881324,+-87.620438(8920)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8920) map </A>","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around January 16th 2008"]}
