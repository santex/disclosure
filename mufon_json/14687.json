{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","divs":["sighting detailsi don't remember the exact date of the event, but i was about 7 or 8 years old. though i was young, this is not an imagined event. i remember it pretty well to this day. i was playing hide and seek with the neighborhood kids, including my brother. the base was my front porch, and being sneaky, decided to double back through my back yard, hop the privacy fence, and come down the rather long (50 yards or so) side yard that ran next to the street. this was ingenious as most of the kids hid around the cul-de-sac my house was on (my house was the corner house). after climbing over and dropping down from the 6-foot fence, i looked up for some reason. no sound or light caused me to look up, i just did, perhaps thanks to the sixth sense of being watched. what i saw was a circular object covered in multi-colored lights that were flashing in patterns. i don't mean a few lights, i mean this thing looked like a times square sign. the craft was motionless other than the lights and made no sound that i recall. the object was directly above me at an altitude of maybe 100 yards. from my perspective it was about 12 inches across if it was 2 feet above my head. i looked up at the craft for a short time, maybe 5-10 seconds. i then sprinted as fast as i could the 50 or so yards to the front of my house without looking back. i don't recall being fearful of the craft, i just ran out of instinct i suppose. i went inside to my room and turned my stereo on. it was a dual cassette and am\\fm stereo that also had an auxiliary input, which was unused. i don't recall why, but i pushed the aux button. what i heard astonished me. before and since nothing but silence came from the auxiliarly source because there was nothing hooked up to it. that night there was a signal however. what i heard sounded like a foreign auctioneer. at least that's the best way i can describe it. i believe there were two other kids with me who also heard it, and i recall us commenting that it was alien tow truck drivers chatting on the radio. like i said only that night did sound come from that stereo when put on the aux mode. no one else saw the craft, but i remember others heard the radio chatter. i haven't seen any other ufo in my life nor have i heard the \"alien chatter\" again. i will never forget that night."],"Object Features":"Other","Date of the Event":"06/30/1994 10:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14687.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14687.html"],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Gladstone","There were no other sightings in Gladstone on or around June 30th 1994"],"Date Submitted":"06/30/1994 10:00 UTC","Longitude":"-94.546977","Latitude":"39.206792","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.206792,+-94.546977(14687)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14687) map </A>","City":"Gladstone","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14687","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Missouri","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Round craft covered in flashing multi-colored lights w/ radio interference.","Log Number":"US-01022009-0003","Country":"United States"}
