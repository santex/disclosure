I noticed the objects because they were brighter than airplanes and seemed to be hovering over the ?Lafyette? Area. I thought it was just an airplane with the airport near by but these objects were brighter than the stars and airplanes I'm used to seeing. The objects didn't do anything they just seemed to hover there, the less brighter one higher the brightest. I don't really have any feelings about what I saw because I'm not sure what it was...plane? Flares? Helicopter? I'm just not sure, if anything I'm just confused. I lost sight od them after turning onto 120th east bound to go home."],"Summary":"2 hovering lights over Lafyette area.","Log Number":"US-12292011-0008","Region":"Colorado","Date Submitted":"12/29/2011 03:41 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"12/22/2011 07:35 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
