{"Summary":"Unexplained objects in sky above Oroville Ca multiple witnesses","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/24/2013 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsReceived phone call from co worker advising of two objects stationary and unidentified at a high altitude. Proceeded outside with a fellow fire officer and witnessed two objects unidentifiable I would estimate the first to be our 11 o clock position the other our two o clock unknown altitude but higher than local beal afb or sac international traffic. Called another friend who was to my north west she and her friend also witnessed the event by this point I would estimate 45 minutes had passed, both objects at same position however second object began a rapid descent and disappeared the other object remained motionless. Neighbors watched, one displayed a photo via cell phone allegedly taken by his friend. The object had a clear to murky center outlined in white similar to a jellyfish, the shape was that of a jellyfish bell or jiffy pop bag but clearly very very large. Received another phone call from co worker advising she had witnessed this before, on that occasion an object came out of the main and appeared to her to shoot the first then both disappeared. Both objects observed this date seemed to vanish. Now surely this could have been giant balloons but I have never observed balloons reman stationary especially at such an altitude. These were strange none of us could identify and very different than prior alleged sightings in Oroville Ca."],"Region":"California","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Oroville","There were no other sightings in Oroville on or around October 24th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"51817","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51817.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51817.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.450677,+-121.536026(51817)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51817) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Latitude":"39.450677","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10242013-0034","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Oroville","Date Submitted":"10/24/2013 10:47 UTC","Longitude":"-121.536026","Source":"MUFON"}
