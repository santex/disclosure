I looked up towards the southern sky and saw a craft. The craft was almost saucer-shaped and had 2 to 3 dozen lights on it (in circular patterns starting from the middle outwards). The lights were different colors (which is what caught my eye in the first place). They were red, yellow, and blue; mostly yellow, though. The craft was of a grey color (it did not match the black of the evening sky). I stopped the car because I couldn���t believe what I was seeing. While parked, I watched as the craft moved West to East. It was rather slow, but in total, I only saw it for twenty seconds. I could not take pictures, as it was too dim to show up on my phone camera. It went out of view (thanks to tree-lined streets), and I went home. When I saw the craft, I was baffled. Afterwards, I was scared and excited about what I saw. There's no other way to describe it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51821.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51821.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10252013-0002","Date Submitted":"10/25/2013 12:46 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.31338,+-111.83133(51821)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51821) map </A>","Region":"Arizona","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Summary":"saw a craft fly from west to east in southern sky"}
