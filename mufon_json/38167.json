I noticed a bright white object on my right side, perhaps a mile or more from me around 800-1000 feet up. The Sky was blue no clouds what so ever. I thought at first it was a small plane but realized it wasn't moving. I continued to watch the object that I would describe as a completely white cylinder with no visible lights windows or propellant devices. This sighting lasted a mere 5 minutes before completely vanishing from sight. Leaving no trace of direction... I would describe it as if it went invisible in a split second. This sighting is my second in this area and both times involved a white cylinder shaped object first in the sky then vanishing. Weird as hell to say the least."],"Sighting Duration":"00:12:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Niagara Falls","There was one other sighting in Niagara Falls on or around May 15th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-05152012-0018"}
