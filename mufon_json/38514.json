The neighbor spotted something in the sky and asked my opinion about what the object was. I looked up and told her that I didn't know. After discussing it we agreed that it was not an airplane. We witnessed only a singular orange light (perfectly round) moving faster than what we would have thought an airplane would have traveled. The light looked bigger than what an airplane light would look like. We watched it for about a minute or two and then the light started to get dimmer and then disappeared all together. The light traveled across the sky, at a pretty good pace, in a straight line. We were pretty stumped as to what it was and then started wondering if we had just witnessed a ufo!"],"Log Number":"US-05252012-0020","Latitude":"31.249463","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"38514","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Region":"Louisiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"05/25/2012 09:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38514.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38514.html"],"Tags":"City","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
