I parked the car and got out. It was an extremely bright light in the west that was not moving and much larger than a star or airplane light. Eventually, it went farther west and was harder to see from my front yard. My next door neighbor said she saw it on Wednesday Feb. 20 and Saturday Feb. 21. It was as bright as a stadium light but bigger and alone in the sky. It would occassionally get brighter and dimmer."]}
