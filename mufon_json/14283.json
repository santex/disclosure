They ran to the door screaming, I thought they were bleeding or something, they wanted me to see it, but it was out of sight (there are trees in way of where it traveled). Had them both draw pictures (attached). It was red, cigar shaped, with light on top in center, and another light that seemed to be floating above it. It had a row of brighter red small lights down the center also. There was no sound before or after. It was moving pretty fast high in the sky (faster than a plane at high altitude) and was about 4 inches long measured at arms length (kids arms). This is 4th UFO sighting in our family since June, 2008."],"Object Features":"Other","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
