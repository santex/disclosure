We were prepared for several days of remote hiking and had chosen a period of time after the close of hunting season for our safety and also to be as isolated as possible with hopes of seeing no people. Slickrock Creek Wilderness is a large road less tract intertwined with deep coves and rugged high southern peaks best known for great trout streams, good bear and wild boar hunting. The weather was absolutely stellar with crystal skies and temperatures at night in the teens. We made our way into a very secluded small cove known as Nichols Cove, a side drainage to the main valley of Slickrock Creek and there we established our first camp. At the end of a day of scrambling up creeks to locate undiscovered waterfalls and orienteering over trail less mountaintops we returned to our camp for some much needed rest and food. After our dinner and after the fire had been established we sat back to enjoy the brisk night air and to gaze into the Milky Way on one of those winter nights that the stars are countless and seem much closer to earth. We all noticed an unusual light somewhat larger than any of the stars moving erratically across the sky, stopping and going and making right angled turns. The light appeared disc shaped and the color was white like a star but less brilliant, somewhat duller and less jewel like than a star. From our camp in the small cove we could see the horizon and the mountaintops surrounding us quite clearly. The disc began to come closer and closer towards our location startling us a bit but we laughed it off and made some jokes about Martians. As the light grew in size we could see that it was indeed a disc shaped object. There was no sound and it continued coming closer to earth dropping behind the ridgeline that separated us from the Slickrock valley. As the disc went out of sight into the adjacent valley a glow spreading into the night sky moved north to south and back again as if following the exact route of the creek. After a few moments the glow began to move up our small valley becoming brighter and brighter as it came closer. All of a sudden a behemoth craft larger than a football field, equally the size of several jumbo jets lifted up slowly and hovered just above the tree line over a small ridge illuminating the entire area. We could see that the light from the disc we had seen in the sky was actually the underneath of the craft and it was encircled in multi-colored lights most of which were reddish in color. We were completely mesmerized and we could 'feel' that someone or something was in the craft and we felt certain they knew we were there. At the risk of sounding clich���, the only image of this thing that I can accurately relate to you to describe this is the end scene in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" where the large ship comes to the top of the mountain. This monster was that large and that dynamic and we were practically catatonic at the sight of it. It was almost ironic months later when that movie came out and we tried in vain to explain to people that was what we saw. Back to the story; In the blink of an eye and with absolutely no sound this huge craft shot skyward faster than the eye could follow and again became the white disc light that we had seen earlier. As if this was not enough to frighten us none of us had moved from our positions around our campfire. A couple of seconds later we began to hear a roaring noise and a pair of fighter jets roared into our black little valley coming so close to the ground we could see the undersides of them. This is when we al seemed to 'wake up'. We all screamed and jumped away into the night. The jets made a few more passes and then returned from the direction and whence they had come. Wait, there is more...First, I am always the fire keeper and after this event was over we all assumed that it took about 20 minutes for the entire scenario to play out. As I said, it was a rather cold evening and I had built a large fire with several hard wood logs that I had cut. We all noticed that the fire was almost burned to coals. Second, we had intended on a week or more of backpacking through the region but the very next morning we packed up without speaking a word and drove the 7 hour trip back to our hometown never mentioning what we had seen. Third, we all worked together at a local restaurant at the time and not one of us spoke about the event until a few months later at a large outdoor party to celebrate the purchase of a friend���s new farm. Dancing around the party fire that night the conversation turned ubiquitously to UFO`s and lights in the sky. Standing next to my friend he began to curse at everyone telling them that they didn���t know what 'bleep' that were talking about. He grabbed me sobbing and exclaimed to everyone \"He is the only one that knows\". It was at this point that I myself began to remember that night in our camp in tiny little Nichols Cove. I will not purport to speculate regarding the origins of the craft we witnessed that night but as a fairly observant guy and somewhat of an aviation buff, I can tell you that we humans are not capable of producing the thing we saw flying even unto this day. Unless the federal government is hiding some rather amazing technology I will maintain that we do not have crafts such as this. This story has lived with me for decades now and upon occasion will haunt my dreams but I am always amused when people want to tell me their UFO stories and talk about seeing lights in the sky. I listen quite carefully and empathetically to them and then I say \"Did you get the jets with yours?\" That���s my story and I���m sticking to it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.322866,+-83.807399(14437)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14437) map </A>","Longitude":"-83.807399","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
