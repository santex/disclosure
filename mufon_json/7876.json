They seemed like they belonged in this sacred place. I felt deep sorrow, compassion, love and a sense of healing from them. They were singing. A lullaby a Mother sings to an injured child. A song one cannot hear, only feel with your heart. The Tibetans did not even take notice. As if it was a normal occurrence. There is the Palace. There is a taxi. There is a monk. There is a man on a bike. There is a truck full of Chinese soldiers, and there in their sky, are glowing spheres of healing light. I had to put China as the country I was in. This was not in China. This was in Tibet. After looking at the pictures you can decide if they are what I believed them to be. Or if they are planets or stars. I saw the stare there. These were not stars When I was in Tibet. I stood and looked into the sky��� And saw the stars for the first time. As they really are. Reds and Blues and Greens and Purple. And colors I do not have a name for. When I was in Tibet I stood and looked into the sky And saw the stars for the first time. I saw them for what they really are. Jewels���set by the hand of God.
