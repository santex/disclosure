I caught a bright light out of my peripheral vision to my right side so I turned and saw an extremely large and bright light. The object swayed from side to side and went up and down slowly. It was hovering very slowly as it did these maneuvers. The light began to fade and it moved away. As it did so fighters from Luke AFB followed it until all aircraft went out of my line of sight. I have seen demonstrations of both the F22 and F35 fly. Neither can do what this craft did. I would be very interested to see if anyone else in my area saw the same thing I did."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
