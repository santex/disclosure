I stepped out onto my porch and to my left as if almost in between looking in the direction of Johnson City, TN and Elizabethon, TN. There was 4 white, hazy lights (approx size--size of each light a grapefruit). The 4 lights as if starting from a center point (disappear for an instant) then geometrically expand out in 4 separate directions without leaving a trail of light or beam of light as if a square of 4 lights in each corner on full expansion (approx full expansion a beach ball) then all 4 lights would go back into center point and disappear for an instant and then repeat the same pattern. Now I know what a lighthouse light will do and usually there is a start point from the ground with a beam of light projecting and circling. I did not see a source of light as if coming from the ground. The lights described above was well above the tree line and horizon."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/27/2012 11:28 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.46942,+-82.271254(37794)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37794) map </A>","Date of the Event":"04/27/2012 10:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-04272012-0025","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
