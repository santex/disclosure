First thought maybe Mars was closer than usual-- the moon was huge in the sky. The orange light was hovering, and I didnt know what to make of it. Thought at first perhaps some kind of aerial fireworks-- it is July 2 as of this report but fireworks dont hover and move like that. I went back around the block to get a better view and it had dissapeared completely. I then contacted a ufo center in ohio and they told me to spread the news; I also googled and found many of the same exact orange fireballs reported in northumberland country here as well as through state college I contacted WNEP TV and they are talking to the meteoroloigst to see if anything was going on of interest that might have caused it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-76.785479","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
