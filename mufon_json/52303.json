The Object would have gone over one of my neighbor's home from where I witnessed it. This was on Friday, November 15th 2013 I was going to quickly let my husband know what had just happened, but he was sleeping and I thought to tell him the next day. I was having difficulty sleeping even more after that sighting, and I just laid in bed with the window in my sight and began so dose off, but I opened my eyes again just in time to see either the same flying object or another one that was on the same path. I was not afraid, but excited for the experience. I've had a couple other sightings throughout my life beginning when I was young. One six years ago while driving cross country from Ca. to MD. Another was 4 years ago early in the morning while walking my dog."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52303.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52303.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"@22:22 I opened myes and saw a large V shaped air ship flying from south over my neighbor's house.
