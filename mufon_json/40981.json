{"Date Submitted":"07/21/2012 10:18 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my pool. Some clouds were moving in so I was looking up at the sky wondering if I should get out. I saw a jet fly over and was watching it. All of a sudden I saw a craft, large in size and not as far up as the jet cross over from one cloud cluster to another. I was shocked and said out loud, ���what the hell was that?��� my wife asked what. I told her and said to watch the other side of the clouds for this weird looking aircraft. It never came out. I can not imagine where it could have gone. The craft was very large and had a wide long fuselage with very large ���skids��� on both sides. I only say skids since I am familiar with hueys and cobras and the features protruded down off the craft in the same fashion as the skids did on choppers. The craft looked like some type of short distance transport or landing vehicle."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40981.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40981.html"],"City":"Kingsland","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Kingsland","There were no other sightings in Kingsland on or around July 21st 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"transport type or landing craft","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.820753,+-81.717084(40981)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40981) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-81.717084","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"07/21/2012 12:00 UTC","Region":"Georgia","Latitude":"30.820753","Case Number":"40981","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07212012-0017"}
