The light would flash very brightly silvery-white as large as Venus then flash as a pinpoint then back again. As I was watching this, 5 small cigar shaped objects caught my eye moving from the south to the north. As I watched these objects which were approximately at 8,000ft, 3 were together and 2 were in front and slightly to the side with all 5 moving faster then a jet airliner. The 3 objects were moving in a counter clockwise motion as they were moving forward. They objects then disapeared. I looked back at the large silvery-white light for a few more seconds and it to just disapeared. The sighting lasted for about 1 minute.This was in Santa Clara, California about 12 noon."],"Country":"United States"}
