My husband and I were walking my friend home when we observed bright orbs in the sky. They were extremely high. One set was in a triangle shape, followed by three that were in a row behind it. They hovered for about 3 minutes then moved rapidly out of sight. Additional orbs came into view, hovered, then followed the first set of orbs. We observed this for approximately 15 minutes before no additional orbs came into view. They were orange in color and looked quite like the international space station did when it passed over our area the previous week. We observed approximately 12 orbs. They left no vapor trail."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Grove City","There were no other sightings in Grove City on or around September 2nd 2012"],"Longitude":"-83.074783","Tags":"City"}
