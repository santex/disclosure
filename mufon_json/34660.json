It is a large, bright, multi-colored, star-like object, moving erradically, changing direction, yet staying within the same general vicinity. My son had already been observing this thing for over an hour before he came and got me. After only a few seconds of gazing at it, I grabbed my video camera and shot 2 videos and several pictures. My son and I went inside to view the pictures and were astounded that after 25 minutes of viewing pictures inside, that it was still out there. So I took more pictures. The object was visible for over 2 hours. I never saw it leave and eventually, I just went to bed. I still continued to look for it and it became visible again on December 10, 2011. I have been documenting this object ever since."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Milledgeville","Latitude":"33.087813","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Milledgeville","There was one other sighting in Milledgeville on or around November 30th 2011","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.087813,+-83.224099(34660)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34660) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/30/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Georgia","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.224099","Date Submitted":"01/06/2012 11:02 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-01062012-0012"}
