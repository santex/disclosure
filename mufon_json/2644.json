I do have video tape footage of what Ibelieve are these crafts. I have mentaly asked for these crafts to appear forother people with some succsess. This sighting was a result of an appointmentthat I asked for after and experience in the middle of the night. The followingis the experience. I woke in the middle of the night an Alien put hishers handin mine. It had three long silky fingers. It was a very friendly gentlegesture but I took it the wrong way. I tried to look up at the individual butcould not. I could not wake my girls friend sleeping next to me. It seems thatall I cold do is bend his fingers back and try to break them. It is strangebecause I have been through a lot with both these Aliens and humanoids and havenever been harmed. I have had numerous sightings and experiences and want mycase researched.Thanks Gary W.
