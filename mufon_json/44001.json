{"Tags":"City","Summary":"Hovering reflective object ejecting (dropping) smaller reflective object.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Houston","divs":["Sighting DetailsWent outside to smoke a cigarette, back yard. Noticed a flash of light in the sky, started watching it, it hovered in same spot for about 4 minutes, then it ejected another smaller reflective object which seemed to ascend evenly with original object. Smaller object moved westward then disappeared. Original object ascended, then moved east. Lost sight of object at about 6 minutes of observation. Video camera on phone would not work, so I attempted to view it through binoculars. Viewing it through binoculars had a Yellow \"prism\" type effect and I could not make out any distinct shape. During observation a Southwest Airplane flew by below object and another unknown jet was flying in the south east area."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-95.626084","Log Number":"US-11182012-0011","Date of the Event":"11/18/2012 12:38 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/18/2012 02:38 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44001.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44001.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"44001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.692901,+-95.626084(44001)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44001) map </A>","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around November 18th 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Latitude":"29.692901","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
