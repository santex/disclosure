It glowed quite brighter than the stars in sky and was the only object seen in that particular part of the sky. I watched the object for about five minutes and thought it might be spinning. I stopped watching it, thinking it might simply be a star. I checked on it later at about 8:20 and saw it had moved west. I checked again at 9:20 and it was gone. This would only prove to be one of the first sightings of the object that would continue to come back at about the same time almost every night since."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35778.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35778.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"01/29/2012 07:40 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Linn","There were no other sightings in Linn on or around January 29th 2012"],"Longitude":"-91.850452","Case Number":"35778","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.485875,+-91.850452(35778)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35778) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
