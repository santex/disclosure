We were heading toward outback to grab something to eat. It was about 5:30 and we were stuck in traffic. I had turned and looked out my window to see two flying objects. It had caught my attention because i have never seen two small orbs turquoise in color pulsating near Los Colinas, TX. It was getting dark, at least it was dark enough to see them. They were flying in no specific pattern all over the place but never went to far. At first i thought it was two birds because of the swooping manner but then they changed color. They seemed to be pulsating slowly. Each orb flew in different ways never synchronizing. The orbs were over some wooded area next to a tall building. I stared at them for about 20 seconds and immediately told my dad to look. He says he saw the same thing as me and was at a lose of words to explain it. I felt my heart beat because i had never seen anything like it. After about 40 seconds the traffic had moved and i lose sight of them."],"Summary":"Small Round Orb","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/12/2009 05:32 UTC","Longitude":"-96.761393","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20486.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20486.html"],"Latitude":"32.812705","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11122009-0008","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date Submitted":"11/12/2009 08:46 UTC"}
