{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving west on U.S. Expressway 83 within the city limits of Donna, Texas, when I observed a very bright saucer-shaped object off slightly to my left (southwest of my position). The object was moving on a steady course from south to north. As it moved, it tipped slightly, revealing that it was saucer-shaped. It gave off a steady, bright white light. I continued watching it for about a minute, but while fumbling around for my cell phone to take a photo, the object had vanished when I looked back up."],"City":"Donna","Case Number":"32881","Date of the Event":"10/26/2011 07:00 UTC","Summary":"Bright saucer-shaped object moving south to north.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.170352,+-98.05195(32881)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32881) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32881.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32881.html"],"Object Shape":"Disc","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"26.170352","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10262011-0006","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Donna","There were no other sightings in Donna on or around October 26th 2011"],"Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-98.05195","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"10/26/2011 09:50 UTC"}
