{"divs":["sighting detailsevent repeated itself two nights. bright light low over israel - original footage july 27th 2007 july 26th, 2:15 canadian pacific time, i browsed to israel's biggest newspaper \"yediot ahronot\"'s website, called \"ynet\". in their main page was a link to reports of bright lights seen over israel. the report included a multitude of witnesses seeing two bright lights hovering over israel, being seen from the center of israel all the way to the south, a distance of roughly 150 km. the article included viewer comments and can be found, in hebrew, here: http:\\\\www.ynet.co.il\\articles\\0,7340,l-3573410,00.html here is the geographical location of the reports: www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\reportsarea.jpg the viewer comments included a heated debate whether these are military flares or not. such military flares are very common in israel. some \"experts\" claimed these are not flares while other \"experts\" claimed these are. many a religious commenter claimed these are signs from god and many other claimed meteors. some claimed ufo's. the flares and meteor claims were problematic because people saw the things in the same place for two hours. some reports said the ufo's were over beer sheva, in the south (city of biblical abraham for your religious crowd). so i called my father (12:30am beer sheva time), woke him and wife. i wish for all of you to have a father (thanks, dr. t) that you can call in the middle of the night from over the ocean and tell him to open the window and scan for ufos!!! instead of hanging the phone on me as expected, he told me he would call back. after 15 minutes he calls me and tells me that he is seeing a big bright light from his 7th floor balcony and filming it. the light is north by northeast roughly 2-3 degrees above the horizon. and far, very far (couldn't tell me how far. many kms). here is the filming geographical location: www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\loc1.jpg www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\loc2.jpg after he ran out of battery(8 minutes of raw footage) , i told him to start taking pictures with all the cameras in the house until all of them have full memory cards and then swap to reserve memory cards and continue. he did, and called me in the morning. the results are as follows: many digital stills which show a bright dot 2-3 arc degress over the horizon. the stills are very dark and just show where the dot is. the footage is better. in full zoom it is quite overexposed but we can clearly see the relative brightness of the light compared to the city street lights. the object was observed for ~15 minutes before it dissapeared. stills (there are many more, all same quality): www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\still1.jpg www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\still2.jpg www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\stillzoom.jpg and here is the movie, unedited: www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\beershevalight.wmv www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\beershevalight2.wmv i also checked the star and planet location for israel at the time, jupiter was in the south, no other bright stars visible to the north, as you can see here: www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\israelsky_nbyne_july27th12_30am.jpg a compilation of all the ynet comments into a map. center is close to betlehem. http:\\\\www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\loc4.jpg ----------- so i analyzed the video and found the following. there is some sort of 'light beam' emitting downward straight vertical from the light. luckily the light is positioned exactly near a side of a tall building, so we can see that the 'beam' is parallell to the dark building. the camera itself is not horizontal, so the 'beam', and the building are 5-6 degrees off vertical. the 'beam' shoots only down, nothing sideways or up. for comparison to a camera glare, see the pic called beershevalight1_0004_nobeamfromstreetlights.jpg where we can see both the main light with beam and the street lights without. the first four picture where clarified: www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\beershevalight1_0001.jpg www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\beershevalight1_0002.jpg www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\beershevalight1_0003.jpg www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\beershevalight1_0004_nobeamfromstreetlights.jpg the next two pics are one embossed and one extremely clarified. www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\beershevalighemboss1.jpg www.bemecollective.com\\pics\\beershevalight1_clarified.jpg why i think it's not a glare: 1. it's only in one direction, true down. 2. it doesn't happen with the street lights. 3. it is the only other detail seen in the emboss. but i cannot be sure. it could be a glare. for you to decide. i'll post more info when i have it. strange or what?
