I saw something not making any noise moving in a V pattern towards the south. I have thought I have seen things before and was able to explane them away as something else. well as I was watching this i was trying to do the samething, The only thing i could think of is birds flying south until it turned. I not a bird expert but i dont think that birds can turn on a dime like this thing did. Also i dont believe that birds fly at night but i can be wrong about the birds i just dont know. the crazyess thing i think about it was that it was almost bleanded into the sky. the only thing that i could see was a small trace of white in the V pattern. Its kind of shocking, Being former Military I know if it was a militray bird or not and i know what they sound like and look like when they fly at night. this was not it at all. Really i am just shocked right now."],"Log Number":"US-09232012-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Kansas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.053609,+-96.834877(42751)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42751) map </A>","Summary":"I really dont know what I saw and I know you guys get to the bottom of things like this.","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.053609"}
