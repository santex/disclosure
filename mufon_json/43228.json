My first thought was fireworks but I did not hear any booming sound prior. They formed a V shaped formation almost a triangle with other orange lights trailing behind. They separated and broke apart and almost seemed to disappear but it is a cloudy overcast night and there is not a star to be seen in the sky. They disappeared into the cloud coverage. They made no sound. There were a lot of them. I unfortunately did not have my celll phone on me to take any pictures."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
