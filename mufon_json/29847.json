Anyways I talked to him and his friend both who witnessed it (middle aged men, who again denied anything like that was possible), And they both described an Amber colored orb floating through the sky coming east over Hermitage flying right over the house that zig zagged direction, stopped hovered, zig zaged again, hovered once more, and then took off straight into the air completely out of sight. They watched this for a little over a minute, but agree its very possible it could of been in the sky longer without them noticing (considering they were outside talking). It made no sound and flew much lower then a plane, and remained a bright amber color without any blinking or pulsating lights. It was a very clear night too so I know they saw something, and it turned middle aged skeptics into believing they saw something they could not explain..Decided to post this today after my dad called curious if other people saw it or reported it too."],"Date Submitted":"07/02/2011 02:56 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/01/2011 09:50 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Hermitage","There were no other sightings in Hermitage on or around July 1st 2011"],"Summary":"Silent Low Amber Colored Starlike Orb","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.24117","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29847.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29847.html"],"Region":"Pennsylvania"}
