The first one we saw was going from north to south, flying about the same speed as an airplain but it looked like a brite white ball of light, and we could see an airplain at the same time. Thats how we knew their was a difference. As the object got to a certain point south of us it dissapeared. The second object was coming from north northeast going south southeast at the same rate of speed , but this one was a ball of red light. The third and fourth ones we seen looked like the first one and heading in the same direction north to south, and it was a bright white light like the first one. They too also dissapeared when they reached a certin point."]}
