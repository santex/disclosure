{"divs":["sighting detailsi already submitted a report aug 3rd on this so to many of you it would sound like you read this. but the only reason i am rewriting it is because i had typed in that it was spotted in chicago but no it was spotted in a suburb of chicago called clarendon hills and it bothered me that i wrote chicago. when filling out the paper i thought they meant basic area. basically i was on my way home from the town of hinsdale coming up on the border of hinsdale and clarendon hills. i was on my bike with my mp3 player listening to a album called hillsong live. i was approaching the route 83 highway a area where cars and bikes and people can go under the highway which leads to a parking lot for people to park for the train and swimming pool. its a good short cut a lot of us do. write before i was about to go under route 83 i saw a thing moving with a light and i thought it was a helicopter going over route 83 and me but i didn't hear any noise and so i started turning down the volume on my mp3 player. it takes about 12 seconds for a bike to get out from underneath route 83 so that i then lost 12 seconds of seeing the sky. therefore when i got out from under the street i looked up at the sky again. i normally would of never looked up but because of seeing something before i went under that street i looked straight up after i got out from underneath the street and saw something hovering. it looked 8 stories high the size of a plastic recyclable garbage can. but it looked small because a garbage can at that height looks small. it was basically roundish but not fully round inbetween round and a egg. it was darkish\\greyish. i think there was a red light at the bottom that was dimmed. since it was red towards the bottom but all basically looked the same color that's why i said it had a hint of red. it was totally staying in the same spot but at the same time moving around a lot like very very fidgety and bouncy. it looked alot more controlled then a toy remote. i read a few days after the incident that small ufos move around a lot like a boat at dock and it was something like that. i described it as bouncy and i keep those words but the word fidgety is a good word too. i stayed on my bike and just kept looking up at it as i was taking my short cut. i dont know why i didn't get off my bike to get a better look. i didn't feel scared. when i got almost a block away by the houses i glanced back and saw it still in the same spot bouncing around. the thing i saw before i went under route 83 and the thing i saw when i came back out from route 83 looked like two different things but i thought it was the same thing or related. the only reason i sent this again is because this was spotted in clarendon hills not chicago."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Illinois","Log Number":"US-08082013-0016","Country":"United States","Case Number":"49609","Summary":"roundish, dark-grey, hovering in same spot but moving around","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.801791,+-87.944974(49609)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49609) map </A>","City":"Clarendon Hills","Latitude":"41.801791","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Clarendon Hills","There were no other sightings in Clarendon Hills on or around July 28th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49609.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49609.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/08/2013 01:09 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-87.944974","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"07/28/2013 08:20 UTC"}
