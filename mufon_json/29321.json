I noticed a small black dot (which I discarded as a balloon at the time)floating in the sky. After tracking it for about one minute. The object then stopped and went the opposite direction and something resembling wings extended from the sides. At this point I was a little shocked and lost track of the object as it flew overhead. There were no planes around when I was outside. Later I was in my car smoking a cigarette a few blocks from where I noticed the object. I saw a man in a black suit, black fedora hat, glasses and ear peace walk past. I also noticed he happened to be carrying what looked unmistakeably like a holster to a pistol under his coat. I noticed this man pass me three times in the course of twenty minutes as if he was patrolling the area. I also saw a black car with no license plates driven by a similarly dressed man and a yet similarly dressed passenger."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/30/2011 10:48 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.617661,+-116.204546(29321)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29321) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/30/2011 04:32 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29321.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29321.html"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Boise"}
