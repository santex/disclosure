{"Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Gila Bend","There were no other sightings in Gila Bend on or around May 27th 2007"],"City":"Gila Bend","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe often travel across the CA-AZ desert between El Centro, CA and Phoenix, Az; and near Gila Bend we have seen these lights frequently. I have video-recorded them and know that several news stations in Phoenix have investigated. Local military officials near Phoenix have claimed that they are flares. Although they do resemble flares, these lights just pop-up without a tail or smoke and have lasted up to an hour. They are orange and can dim and change formations, so unless it is a new type of flare, I am not convinced. These lights have started popping up near the Imperial sand dunes and sightings have been made across the border in Mexicali, Mexico. So again, they can't be flares used by our military. The lights can be seen very often, and since it is a long deserted stretch of road they are easy to spot and track."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8862.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8862.html"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"series of lights, similar to a flare.
