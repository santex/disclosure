We were on the South side of the building facing south, when we both noticed a formation of lights. The speed of the formation and altitude was steady and resembled what one would expect from airplanes heading toward Lambert International airport. The formation was composed of points of light that looked just like stars, approximately 9 points of light with a tight cluster in the middle of this formation that appeared to be one object with five points of white lights on it in a diamond pattern. The position of the points of light did not appear to change. The formation was traveling towards the northwest. We had eyes on it for approximately two minutes and lost sight of it because of the view to the west is obstructed by the buildings design."],"Date Submitted":"12/31/2008 11:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01012009-0026","Summary":"Formation of approximately nine points of light, at its center five points of lights in a diamond pattern.","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
