After a second or two the V-shape was apparent with five or more lights on the underside of each wing? of the craft. The V shape was wide, that is not cheveron shaped, and there was no sound associated with the sighting. It disapeared behind my house and into the haze in the direction of Boulder. The entire event took less than 15 seconds. This is my third sighting of an unidentified object and I knew exactly what I was looking at, although different than the first two."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-104.976193","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Wings","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Summary":"V shaped wing with 5 or 6 lights on each wing flying in N-NW direction.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.743964,+-104.976193(15775)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15775) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02282009-0011","Date Submitted":"02/28/2009 07:25 UTC","Case Number":"15775"}
