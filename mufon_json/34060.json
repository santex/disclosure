{"Longitude":"-86.577287","Object Shape":"Star-like","divs":["sighting detailsthe 3 pictures are from dec 15 thursday: we first noticed a small line at the bottom of the sky was very lit up over a field like daytime but it was about 9:45 pm at night. i stopped to try and get pictures of the sky thinking that my camera would pick that up because it's so bright (my camera is not night time friendly) but got more than i realized. while taking a picture of the skyline, i captured the source, 3 lights hovering around this field. very interesting to see what ever it was! the lights were at times very low to the ground almost touching it and sometimes up to the treeline, after about 4 to 5 mins they took off out of sight maybe behind a cloud. it was cloudy and rainy out as well. *dec 14 wednesday - headed for that same field area: just the night before we seen a orange star like object that was just ahead of us as we were driving, it headed to a flashing air plane tower (or whatever those are called radio\\tv towers?) that's by the gas station. i got out of the car at the gas station and watched it hover over the tower for about 3 mins. then it started heading right for me as it got closer directly over my head i could make out the lights to be 4 total - 3 white and 1 red it was shaped like a triangle and was dark, possibly black or very dark grey. there was absolutely no sound and the odd part was it went right to the tower, hovered, then back to me but i did not see it turn around or make any turn what so ever,like it just went in reverse? after it went by me it headed back toward the same field where i seen the smaller lights on thursday dec 15 it flew off very fast and was gone. *from a distance this object looks like a moving star, just a single light,orange or amber in color(almost like its on fire). this is the first time i got a good close look at it from underneath! i have seen this object in the area now a few times. it has been showing up allot this past week in the same area. almost like it's on a path there and back every time with brief hovering stops along the way. i briefly looked around and seen 2 people getting into their car at the gas pump they were looking at it as well. they drove off slowly toward the tower watching and then went on i am assuming."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"34060","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.522441,+-86.577287(34060)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34060) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-12162011-0014","Region":"Tennessee","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.522441","Summary":"UFO star like lights hovering and moving over field in TN.
