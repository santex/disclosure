I notice a very faint light coming my direction at a very rapid velocity. The light was highlighted on the front of the craft in a thin line almost unvisible. Unless you weren'tlooking at it you would not notice it. The shape looked like a triangle and got more prominent as it came closer to me. It moved very fast,smooth and silent through the sky. I saw it for maybe five seconds. It was as wide as the block that i live on! It was huge!!!!!! OMG! I cant believe i just saw a ufo!"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-121.48853","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.584882,+-121.48853(36047)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36047) map </A>","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were 2 other sightings in Sacramento on or around February 24th 2012"],"Summary":"triangular shape ufo sighting please read the detailed description","Latitude":"38.584882","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36047.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36047.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"36047","Sighting Duration":"00:00:07","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"02/24/2012 07:35 UTC","City":"Sacramento"}
