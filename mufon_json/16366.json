It seemed to be about 6 airplanes size and it seemed to just hang in the sky suspended and then suddenly it vanished. it DID NOT fly over the mountains because i was stationary at the time and was staring at it intently trying to identify a man made aircraft. this aircraft did not have airplane characteristics because it did not make a sound, it did not leave a jet stream in the sky, and it did not have any visible wings. the sighting lasted about 8 seconds. i felt nervous and excited after this experience and then hopped on this computer and reported it."],"Date Submitted":"04/01/2009 07:24 UTC","Sighting Duration":"07:24:35","Longitude":"-119.751599","Latitude":"39.542471","Log Number":"US-04012009-0010","Source":"MUFON"}
