At first, I thought it was just a balloon. Then I noticed it was floating towards the left (west, I believe) and the clouds were moving in the opposite direction (right, or east). Therefore it was going against the wind current. As I watched, the sun temporarily shone off the object and it seemed to gleam, making it appear somewhat metallic. Then the object stopped completely and hovered for about a minute. Then it changed direction and started to float with the clouds (to the east). Then it stopped again and hovered, and looked like it was moving very quickly back and forth. Then it began moving back to the left and getting higher (and smaller). I watched for almost 20 minutes, wishing I had some binoculars with me or a high quality camera. It finally got so small it just disappeared."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12002.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12002.html"],"Case Number":"12002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.949923,+-84.209011(12002)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12002) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Norcross","There were no other sightings in Norcross on or around August 9th 2008"],"Log Number":"US-08092008-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
