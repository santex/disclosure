path","divs":["sighting detailsmy cell phone charger had broke and i was driving southbound on route ninety five. i looked to the east and noticed a fairly good sized cloud. to the east of the cloud there was a contrail that had begun to be dispsersed by the wind. in between these two points of reference and low down towards the horizon there was a shiny triangle, just sitting there not moving just sitting there. as i continued to drive i kept my eye on it, i went behind a bend in the highway and when i could see it again, the triangle was now about halfway up the vertical length of the cloud and it had left a contrail. at this point i pulled over to the side of the highway and got out of my truck with my binoculars. i rested my elbows on my tool box and trained the binoculars on the object. when i had got it into focus the object looked like it was made of a shiny angular(square) frame. it still looked like a traingle but inside the triangle there was three circles that looked like very big halogen lights. i work in a winery and we have four halogen lights that are about a foot in diameter with a kind of cage around them that is what it reminded me of. i kept the binoculars on in it for a few minutes, but the binoculars aren't very high powered so what i just wrote is basically all that i saw. upon reflection i think it could have been in the shape of a pyramid. after a few minutes i checked my watch and was going to be late for work so i packed it in, no one else on the road seemed to notice. i had also seen four craft similar to these about three and a half years ago. i was driving down route three at around the same time,three or four in the afternoon i was wearing shorts at the the time so i think it was in june or july of two thousand seven. i was heading in a south westerly direction along the same route as ninety five i was in rhode island this time, around the exeter\\coventry area. i looked up in the western sky and saw three shiny triangles in a traingle formation. as i followed the road they would move in and out of my line of sight, well they weren't moving i mean my sight of them was periodically obstructed over about a fifteen minute period. for the last five minutes of sight i observed a fourth object that looked identical to the others a little to the west and higher in the sky from the position of the original formation that i saw. i didn't have the binoculars at the time so i didn't pull over. also not to cram so much in here but i have three more quick stories to relate about a different type of object. as i said i work at a winery in stonington connecticut. in the summer my job includes hedging the rows, this is basically walking up and down the rows and trimming the tops of the plants once they have grown over the top guide wires. being that the vineyard is a wide open space it affords a veru clear view of the air traffic, we are close to the coast so we get a lot of coast guard planes, as well as larger c 130s from the military base in quonsett point rhode island, so i am no stranger to seeing planes and blimps, but they always have wings that are usually visible even at high altitudes. well it was probably in july mid july a tuesday around two thirty because i had just decided to knock off and walk in. i turned north to star walking up the hill and i saw it. it was moving swiftly towards the east. at first i thought it was the coast guard cargo plane, but it was much bigger, and it had no wings. the way i first described it was like a large propane tank, a hundred feet, maybe twice that, laid on its side. it was all white except for a red stripe about one third the way up it from the back end, it was moving at a very fast rate exiting my line of sight before i could cover about fifty feet. at first i thought it might be a blimp, but the top and bottom were flat and only the two ends were rounded, later i heard someone describe something that they had seen as like a tylenol caplet, which is also a good description as far as i'm concerned. also if it was a blimp i would think that the sponsor's name would so up clearly on it. i mentioned it to a couple people and they thought i had seen the hood milk blimp i went on the internet and searched for pictures of it and found quite a few, but these were obviously blimps, bulging out in all directions and no staight lines except on the pilot house. again the object i saw looked like the top and bottom were as straight as an arrow. i had two other sighting of the same object over the next four days, two days later i saw it again from the vineyard heading in the same easterly direction at roughly the same time. and then on saturday of that smae week my fiance and i were heading north on ninety five around exit six in ri it passed again heading east. both my fiance and i saw it that time and she says she didn't see any wings either, but she isn't sure that it wasn't a blimp of some sort. these ar ethe experiences i've had and i would just like to pass them on to you hoping you can use them to further the case for disclosure. if i can be of any help you are welcome to contact me. i heard on coast to coast that you are skeptical about multiple sightings, but it is what it is, hope you can use my information. james"],"Object
