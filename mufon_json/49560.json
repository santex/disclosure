Swim a way in fish like motion, then stop. A small object broke off, swam like a baby fish and then rejoined the main star like object. I would guess they were outside the atmosphere, satellite distance. I thought it was most likely sun reflection on the objects, not any lights. Seemed organic. In the end, stopped completely and \"pretended\" to be a star. I didn't wait out the staring contest. Frustrated no one else saw it. I made multiple calls for people to look, no one answered. Does anyone else ever look up? Weirded me out."],"Log Number":"CA-08072013-0001","Date of the Event":"07/27/2013 10:30 UTC"}
