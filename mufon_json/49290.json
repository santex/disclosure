It went over the top of my house, above the treetops then dipped down behind the trees, then a cylinder shape arose from behind the trees going straight up in the air, it had 2 very bright white lights on either side and a green light coming from a dome shaped top, after a few seconds it disappeared behind the trees. I had no fear or trepidation of the event, a friend was with me at the time but he was driving and did not see the event. I went into the house about 9:30 without fear and slept all night without disturbance."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome","Log Number":"US-07292013-0016","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"North Carolina","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-80.30595","City":"Winston-Salem","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"36.044569","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.044569,+-80.30595(49290)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49290) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cylinder","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Winston-Salem","There were no other sightings in Winston-Salem on or around June 20th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"49290","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49290.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49290.html"]}
