My attention was caught by a very bright light out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, and I saw in the western sky, just barely peeking over the tops of the trees a very bright fireball looking object. The object did not appear to be moving, and was making no noise. It was reddish orange in color. I continued to watch for a minute, changing my position so as to see from different angles, and finally I decided to mention it to my husband, who was also outside with me at the time. He said he had noticed it a couple of minutes prior. We continued to observe for a minute or so, then I turned to him to ask him what he thought it could be. After discussing the possibilities, I turned back to check on it, and it was gone. I tried to change position and find it again, but there were no traces left in the sky of the object."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.013182,+-98.476096(43422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43422) map </A>","Region":"Kansas","Date of the Event":"10/19/2012 11:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-10212012-0002","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43422.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43422.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-98.476096","Case Number":"43422","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"39.013182","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed"}
