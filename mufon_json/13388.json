My daughter and I decided to get in my car and head to Stephenville to see what we could see. As soon as we turned onto 377 West, we saw a light moving towards the west. Every now and again, the object would zoom back and forth and you could see three lights below the white lights when this occurred. We followed it all the way to Stephenville. It then proceeded to head west towards the Dublin area. We did not follow it after we arrived in Stephenville. My daughter and I could not believe what we saw. I have never seen anything like this before."],"trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were 5 other sightings in Stephenville on or around October 29th 2008"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10302008-0011","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"We saw a white light moving from east to west on 377 going towards Stephenville","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"13388","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-98.200363","Latitude":"32.224176","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.224176,+-98.200363(13388)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13388) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City"}
