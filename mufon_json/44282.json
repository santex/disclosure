It was moving to fast to be an air craft. It was below cloud level, but still very high in altitude. We watched it for a Min or so, then it just vanished. I know what aircraft look like, and how they behave. This was NOT and aircraft, at least not from here. After I arrived at work, I was approached by two fellow employee's who asked if we had seen a bright light, and of course we told them yes. They were travelling from Rood-house towards Jacksonville. They seen it to the east of their location. They were closer to the object and stated that it had strobbing lights on it. That would put the object somewhere between Springfield and Jacksonville."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","City":"New Berlin","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44282.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44282.html"],"Latitude":"39.739376","trends":["There have been no other sightings in New Berlin","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
