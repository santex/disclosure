{"divs":["Sighting DetailsJust finished dinner, went out for a cigarette, facing west(310 degrees, approx); clear night, constellations visable, no moon, no clouds, vis unlimited, no wind. Observed object as to resemble satellite on easterly course(120 approx). Object passed through constellation ORION and reversed course in a tight left-hand turn unlike satellite or aircraft capability. Object proceded west(approx. 300 degrees) for about 3 secs and then abrubtly (at 90 degrees, immediate)turned north towards northern star in ORION at approx 4x speed and vanished (approx. 1 second). Sir, I am an FAA Liscensed Aircraft Dispatcher since 1982. This was not a conventional aircraft. No visable navigation or other types of lighting were present at any time. The only light on said object was the same as reflected from known satellites, which remained constant throughout all turns. Truly a unique experience for me. No other witnesses although I called for them (unable to see due to sight restrictions; near-sightedness."],"Case Number":"6592","City":"Absecon","Longitude":"-74.495708","Latitude":"39.42845","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Absecon","There were no other sightings in Absecon on or around January 4th 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:25","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.42845,+-74.495708(6592)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6592) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/04/2007 06:14 UTC","Region":"New Jersey","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6592.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6592.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/04/2007 06:14 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Object coursed from West to East at satellite altitude and speed....","Log Number":"US-03202007-0011","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"None"}
