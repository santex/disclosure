Then it would change to a small white light, and back again periodically. We saw what appeared to be dark clouds around it, but they seemed to move around the light which seemed to fade from time to time but never completely and then return to full brightness. These could only be seen when it was not vertical. We took a few turns to get a better look and watched this all unfold for probably five minutes until eventually the light could not be seen anymore. We felt perplexed, not scared, but definitely curious. Unfortunately, my phone was not able to pick up the object on its camera."],"Region":"Montana","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Silver oblong object in the sky standing vertically that seemed to change to a light when horizontal and back again.","Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Unknown"}
