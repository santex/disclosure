It had a vertical line of same material dropping from the bottom which followed along with the larger shape. On our deck, we are directly perpendicular to a bright star and the line passed in front of the star. It disappeared onto the horizon within about 15 minutes. Called KARE 11 news to see if a meteorologist was available, but no weather people were there. Tried to photograph on several settings, but couldn't get an image. Drew simple renditions which we will scan and submit tomorow. Likely weather related, but witnesses hadn't seen anything similar before. In retrospect, noticed no airplane activity which is unusual, because MSP airport frequently flies airplanes on approach or take off over the house. First airplane noticed was at approximately 9:15."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-93.450419","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
