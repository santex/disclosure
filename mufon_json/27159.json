By the time I turned onto Lakeside, I realized there was no stadium in that direction and the lights were too big anyway. I pulled over and watched as a large, dark, triangular shaped object floated silently over me. It had 3 large white, unblinking lights on one side only (the lights that I had originally thought to be stadium lights)and was moving quite slowly, with no sound. It was coming from the direction of the lake moving toward the direction of the military Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth, roughly SE to NW. It eventually faded into the distance (by this time my line of sight was such that I could no longer see the lights, just the shadow of the vehicle.) I just kept asking myself \"am I really seeing this?\" It was like nothing I've ever seen before or since."],"City":"Benbrook","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Benbrook","There were no other sightings in Benbrook on or around January 27th 2009"],"Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"01/27/2009 12:00 UTC","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27159.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27159.html"]}
