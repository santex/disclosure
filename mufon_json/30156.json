{"Summary":"Light seen while power was out","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07132011-0006","Tags":"City","Region":"Illinois","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas sleeping downstairs because storms earlier in the day had knocked out power. Woke up at an unknown hour to use the bathroom and upon laying back down on the floor in my family room noticed that there was a light shining across the cieling of my dinning room. I was really tired and didn't think much of it and the light went off after a minute or so. The I remembered that the power was out in my entire neighborhood (and across large portions of Northen Ill and Southern WI. I should also note that my house backs up to a natural area and the nearest house in the direction (east) of the sliding door to the dinning room is several hundred feet. I cannot shake the feeling that this was something unusual given the hour and location of the light. I only wished I had come to my senses sooner. The hour I listed as seeing the light is a total guess as no clocks were running. When I got up after realizing that this was unusual, the sky was very clear, in fact the clearest I can remember in a long time as there was no light pollution due to the power outage."],"Longitude":"-89.390558","Date Submitted":"07/13/2011 03:30 UTC","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/11/2011 02:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.637495","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30156.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30156.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.637495,+-89.390558(30156)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30156) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"30156","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
