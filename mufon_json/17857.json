{"Latitude":"39.774216","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsJuly 5, 2009. Between 10:30 and 11:00PM EST. I live on the south side of Indianapolis, IN. Went out to see some of the lingering fireworks and a moving light caught my eye in the southern sky. Just above the tree-line was a hovering object, composed of 5 glowing orange lights in a very tight pentagon shape. Although my initial thought was that it was some sort of firework, as I continued to watch it, it didn't burn out as I would have expected a firework to. In fact, the object continued to hover for a good three minutes, gliding slightly side to side, turned a little and then very slowly headed up. During all this time the glowing orange lights did not dim or become lessened, although they rotated slightly as the object moved. I still didn���t believe what I was seeing and ran back in to the house to get my husband. At this point I was starting to believe I was seeing something not from this world and my heart was racing and I felt excited and a little scared. By the time my husband came out, the object was still there, hovering. After we watched it for another 2-3 minutes, it continued to slowly glide up and gradually grew smaller as if it were getting farther away. I said to my husband, \"oh, they're leaving\" - it looked as if it was a ship flying away. And after a few more minutes finally became a tiny orange pinpoint of light and then it was too small to see. I feel very intrigued by what I saw, and quite curious in thinking about what it might have been. I've always been fascinated by the idea of visitors from other planets, but until tonight have not seen any first-hand evidence of it actually happening. I only wish I hadn't been so caught up in watching and had thought to get my camera, as I do not have any physical documentation."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17857.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17857.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Five orange lights arranged in a pentagon shape hovering near Indianapolis, IN.","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"07/05/2009 10:45 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Tags":"City","Case Number":"17857","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There was one other sighting in Indianapolis on or around July 5th 2009"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07062009-0002","City":"Indianapolis","Longitude":"-86.152494","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.774216,+-86.152494(17857)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17857) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/05/2009 10:45 UTC"}
