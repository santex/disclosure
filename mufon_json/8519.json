This stayed stationary for about 1 minute and then it dissappeared. I have seen meteors and it as NOT this. We were heading East and the light as to the North. It was about 30��� in the sky. Please note this stayed stationary. Then just winked out. Mars was to the east of us slightly to the North. It was appriximately 5 to 10 times bigger than Mars. Also, there were no clouds in the sky (check the Radar for this). I am 37 and I am a Quality Engineer. I spent 6 years in the Army and I am not Prone to \"Seeing Things\". I had my 14 year old son and a friend of his in the car as well. In addition, my 10 daughter was in the car. I pointed this light out to them and we all watched it! I have lived in the country and I am an amature astronomer. This as not a plane! I want to remain anonymous. However with my military training and my Profession in Quality, I tried to capture as much information as I could and present this to you. I hope in some small way that this helped. On another note, when my wife was driving the Kids to school this morning, she and both of my children witnessed 2 white lights (in roughly the same direction as the Orange Light) in the sky dissappear."],"Longitude":"-83.645369","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around November 30th 2002"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11302007-0014","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Date of the Event":"11/30/2002 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/30/0002 10:35 UTC","City":"Arlington","Summary":"Orange and White light in the sky that dissappeared (NOT a Meteor)","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"40.897865","Case Number":"8519"}
