I looked up and saw what looked like a giant gray orb floating in the sky, and it just kept rotating around and around. I got out of the car to get a closer look as I was curious about what it was and when I realized what it was I jumped back inside my car for my camera, but as soon as I got my camera out of the car it flashed blue for a second and zoomed away but I was able to take a picture of it before it disappeared entirely."],"Case Number":"27569","Country":"Canada"}
