It was 3:30 pm. There was a clear blue sky, with some white clouds around the horizon, but it was very bright and sunny. I was looking up at the sky when i suddenly saw a white, round, short cigar shaped object moving slowly across the sky. It was in the northern direction, just above the top of a small mountain with some apartment blocks and houses on it, and slowly moving towards the top and disappeared behind it after about 15 seconds. Location was about 59���26'N 10���37'E. First i thought 'hey a plane!' because there hadn't been any air traffic for days because of the volcano in Iceland. From what i would guess is that it flew much lower then an airplane. A little bit slower too. It was a bright white tube with rounded edges. No wings, or marks or anything on it. It flew in a perfect straight line and held a very steady speed. Somehow there was something really calm about it. I don't know. I really concentrated on what i saw, and heard, but it didn't make a sound. There was no sound at all! Earlier today i had heard the first plane in days, and remembered that to listen for it when i saw the object, but it was completely silent. It's a very quiet neighborhood, so there wasn't much noise at all. I compared it to some birds as well, but it was too calm, the steady speed, and the straight line, no shaking or swinging. I thought of a balloon too, but a balloon would've been affected by the wind and it's direction and speed would vary. I've never seen a blimp here, and it was too small and had no propulsion of any kind as far as you could see. I would think that it's extremely unusual for me to see a UFO in the couple of minutes that i'm outside my work in this small town here in south Norway. There's nothing interesting or significant here. The chances are one in a billion i'd think... But still, it really made an impression on me and i really tried to find out what it could be while looking at it, but i really don't know what it is."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ostfold","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/21/2010 03:30 UTC","Case Number":"22950","Date Submitted":"04/24/2010 03:23 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
