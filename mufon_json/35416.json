It was too close to be an airplane, and too far to be a helicopter. i stared at it and noticed the color of it was reddish and had lights on it. It hovered but also moved slowly around that part of sky for a minute, leaving no trail like an airplane. It was a circular shape. I turned into neighborhood keeping my eyes on it the whole time. I took my eyes off to get out of car to look at it and it was gone. No trails left no sight of it. In a split second it had just disappeared. In mid daylight i saw thing object, it appeared to be just looking around watching moving slowly and then it vanished in the two seconds i took my eyes of of it. I went to grab my phone to take a video recording and my phone was dead,"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States"}
