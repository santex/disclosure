It really stuck out because it seem to be the only thing that was shining in the sky at the time. There were no stars noticeable in the sky.I watched the object for about 5 minutes and it seem not to move at all. I ran inside and grab the binoculars to get a better look. It seem to be transparent and balloon shaped. After about 20 25 the object seem to turn an orange color, just like the sky a soon as he sun goes down. I watched the object till about 8:03pm and the object became very faint and hard to see."],"Disposition":"IFO"}
