Garrison Street in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Object was following New Street and going north. It turned left to go west for two short blocks following Garrison Street, then turned right facing north as though remotely controlled. There was a young man yelling from a bicycle that the object was following him from the south side of Bethlehem. It seemed like a cigar shaped cloud. Dozens saw it. WAEB radio found out about it and asked people to call in what they saw. Dictated over the phone to me, John Royer F.I., by reportee. Suggest Jeff in Macungie be assigned to this case because reportee WILL talk to someone. She doesn't care who knpws her name ,etc. Very open person.
