{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family was coming home from a firework outing, and as we were waiting at a stop light, I looked into the sky and spotted a red dot. The closer it got, the more we could see the color..it was a reddish orange yellow. As you looked at it, it seemed like it was on fire, flaming. It was moving slowly, and it was a pretty nice size, bigger than a plane. We couldn't believe our eyes, and I swear our voices were raising, we started sweating, and our hearts were pounding. I didn't think to turn on the radio though, to see if there was static. The sight was NOT a normal thing to see, I was so surprised. This is something that I never saw before, and all four of us agreed that it was a UFO. It's funny because the entire time we were watching fireworks, my brother and I were talking about UFOs."],"Case Number":"17853","Latitude":"40.83423","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Koppel","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-80.322286","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17853.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17853.html"],"City":"Koppel","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.83423,+-80.322286(17853)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17853) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"07/05/2009 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Reddish orange flame in the sky, moving slowly.","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date Submitted":"07/05/2009 12:00 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-07052009-0056"}
