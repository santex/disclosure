As we were crossing the bridge over the Miss. Reservoir a we started witnessing lights right above the treetops. The weather was clear and there were absolutely no planes in the area that we could see or hear. As we started crossing the bridge we noticed lights that formed a triangle. We had been videoing historical places all afternoon so we had our video camera with us. My son started filming. We saw the lights appear and then disappear and then again form a triangle and move off to the left horizontally and then down below the treetops. Then the object simply disappeared. As soon as we get the proper cord to download the video to the computer I will upload to MUFON. We told MUFON investigator Tim Wagner about this incident via telephone."],"Longitude":"-86.067121","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/25/2008 09:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"Unknown"}
