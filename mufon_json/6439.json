during the ~30 minute event there were no flights at all. i am not even certain how long it was before a passenger airliner even passed overhead again. i do not recall any flights that evening passing through thier normal route to the east. in short, the craft slowly gained in altitude and dissappeared to the east in approx 30 minutes. an airliner normally dissappeared in ~1\\10th of that time. the helicopters also left the area though i do not recall in what direction they departed as i was observing the craft and not too interested in the helicopters. though, i do recall that the helicopters when entering the area did so from a westerly direction; that is to say that the helicopters were attempting to follow the craft (though they were about 0.5 - 1 mile south of the craft). considering that the helicopters were searching such a small region of airspace and ground, and were due south of my position, i can conclude that through whatever means they were 'tracking' the craft, that the craft reached its lowest altitude at the point at which i oberserved it fly directly overhead. at the time the area was somewhat rural and given it was in the evening, and unless an observer were to just and happen to look up and see it (though it was dark in color) there were likely not more than a handfull of other observers to the incident. though i am very certain that the air traffic controllers both at detroit metro and at willow run airports had the next best possible oberservations of the craft other than my own. i can only logically conclude that the us government believed that the craft had 'come down' in the area (perhaps thinking it had crashed) and were attempting to locate and recover the craft. additionally, i would estimate the craft to be larger than a boeing 747. it was indeed a solid craft and not a flight of ultralite airplanes: it blocked the stars from sight as it passed overhead. i can only wonder about the records of flight activity at detroit metro that evening. perhaps there is a way to cooberate this sighting with the airports records of that night."],"Longitude":"-83.291874","City":"Flat Rock","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6439.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6439.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
