We were parked and witnessed a light make a sharp z pattern in the sky and it was proceeding towards us directly. We were both extremely frightened. I started the car and drove towards town and put the light behind us. We went as fast as we could until we got to town and we were very relieved that we were not captured, which was the impression that I had. It was trying to get us. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I would have stopped. It made a very strong impression on me."],"Longitude":"-96.161667","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"light makes a z pattern and approaches my car","Case Number":"19918","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Oklahoma","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.562025,+-96.161667(19918)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19918) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/12/2009 11:22 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Barnsdall","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19918.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19918.html"]}
