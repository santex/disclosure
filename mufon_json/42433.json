{"Summary":"multiple objects moving across sky in multiple directions at different times witness by three people","divs":["Sighting Detailsno clouds in the area very very clear tonite.the first object appeared at 8:22pm moving from N to S. Second object moving from W to E at 8:29pm. Third object from S to N at 8:35p. Fourth object moving from N to S at 8:52pm Fifth object moving from N to S at 9:01pm. Sixth and Seventh objects from W to SW in unison then at the same time Eighth object moving from E to NW at 9:11pm. Two of us tracked the two objects traveling as one while one person tracked the single object traveling solo. Multiple planes traveling in their normal routes while these objects made their passes. The planes appeared to be much lower than objects. The planes could be heard while the ufo objects made no sounds. Last ufo object at 10:33pm traveling from N to S. Stopped obsevations at 10:58pm. Started to research to whom and how to report sighting. note objects moved across the sky at almost 2-3 times faster than the planes apeared to. I have watched the international space station travel by at times. these objects appeared much less faint and smaller in comparisson. we also noticed several shooting stars in several different directions while watching these objects. shooting stars and objects not in the sky at the same time but during the time duration. shooting stars much much faster and making streaking tales."],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"42433","Latitude":"34.974212","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Guadalupe","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/10/2012 03:29 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.974212,+-120.544288(42433)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42433) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Guadalupe","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"09/09/2012 08:22 UTC","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42433.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42433.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-09102012-0006","Longitude":"-120.544288","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California"}
