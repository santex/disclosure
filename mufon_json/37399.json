I had the lani blinds fully open and and the sliders open. From where I was sitting I can see quite a large area outside. It was approximately 8:40pm 2 redish orange lights appeared on the western horizon traveling at a steady speed. My wife was sitting in a chair next to me. I jumped up and called her to see the UFO's. We both stood in the lanai and observed them flying side by side. When they were exactly over head a 3rd object appeared at a higer rate of speed ( like trying to catch up to the other 2. We ran to the front of the house and saw the other 2 for about a couple of min and poof they vanished the third came over head and it vanished. My wife does not believe in UFO's I asked her now do you believe she said I can't explain what we saw it was weird because there was no sound. It was calm no clouds and very clear no airplanes or helocopters nor were these satelights. As they were flying too fast to be any one of the above.I wish I had the time to grab my camera but we were both excited at what we saw. Writing this the next day I still have goose bumps."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-04122012-0006","City":"North Port","Summary":"Travel from west to southeast disapered slightly overhead pulsating orange/red and yellow","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"37399"}
