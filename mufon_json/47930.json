{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I both saw this light in the sky at the same time. We live in a city of 200K people so there is plenty of light pollution. It was a clear night and we saw what appeared to be a satellite. It was not blinking so I ruled out plane. It was moving a little faster than most satellites typically do. It was a very weak light as if a dim star but being able to see it in the middle of town it must have been brighter than it appeared. I was moving across the sky and then began to wobble making several \"U\" shaped deviations from the flight path and then began going straight again. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but my wife saw the same thing at the same time I did. It was visible for less than 1 minute and then faded away. As soon as it disappeared an airplane flying at relatively low altitude (landing at nearby airport) went by overhead."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Case Number":"47930","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.670767,+-88.190056(47930)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47930) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47930.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47930.html"],"City":"Mobile","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Satellite-like with a wobbly path","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Mobile","There were no other sightings in Mobile on or around June 4th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"30.670767","Date of the Event":"06/04/2013 09:01 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/06/2013 04:32 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Alabama","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-88.190056","Log Number":"US-06062013-0017"}
