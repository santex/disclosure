(as in def not 10-20 and def not 60-70) it wasn't turning anymore, it was traveling east over hwy 80 up the auto mall \"valley\" - still with the two lights offset in height. i'd been watching it over the napa river bridge, through vallejo (on 37), past 6 flags amusement park. i lost sight of it while taking the 37 \\ 80 west offramp. behind the overpass. i caught a brief glance of it looking backwards on 80 - then i couldn't see the 7-8 dimmer lights between the 2 bright lights, but traffic was a bit hectic there. i took the first offramp and doubled back on admiral callaghan, i couldn't see it, but caught a momentary glimpse of a lighted spot 1000 to 1500 ft up on the valley ridge, right about at the target store shopping center. i'd guess that it was 80% to 90% of the way to the top of the hills (i could see the outline of the ridgeline). the lighted spot was reflected light, and i couldn't see any particular point of light, just a very brightly lighted area 50 to 100 ft wide up near the ridge. i lost direct line of sight behind the auto dealers and when i got to the top of admiral callaghan, i couldn't see the light on the hill anymore. i went down to auto mall parkway, turned right and kept looking up to find the lights again. nothing. in recreating my initial view, what i first had thought was \"downwind\" on rwy 24 at kapc, was wrong. the lights were over the northern edges of the town of vallejo, a few miles south of the airport, about inline with the napa \\ solono county borders. i'm 100% sure of the 2 non-directional lights, the 7-8 dimmer lights and the slow speed, the altitude and the light on the hillside. duration of observation, about 10 minutes."]}
