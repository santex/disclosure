i was on foot walking. the last people that i saw at the amtrak station before i left was the guy that worked there closing the station and a black guy getting in a taxi with some foreign guy driving. as a child i saw a red light in the sky on easter. i use to turn around playing as a child like i could fly. as a child i use to love to lay outside at night and look at the stars. i have always known that a higher intelligence existed that sort of watched after all of us. most of our technology comes from these beings that we cannot see. my intent to go and work for customs was to track down human trafficking and look for missing persons. i have always known that aliens exist but i just dont talk about it. before i was accepted into the customs and border patrol program i had a bad feeling that the east coast was going to be hit by something. it was like i knew that something was coming. i could feel it! my plans in life were to get me and my two boys off the east coast. i wanted to move to montana because i thought we would be safe there. i also wanted to go to the montana area because whatever i am i knew there would be others like me. i can meet people and i either like them or not just by eye contact. whatever this intelligence is that has came to our earth is like an energy force that can jump into a human and leave at will. you can tell when this occurs when someones eyes may change colors. i have seen these light things and they do not bother me. there is something else here on earth that is not good. i get really cold chills and have time lapses when these things are around. what ever these things are they can take you driving down the road. an example of what i am talking about is like when you drive somewhere and get to you're destination and you dont remember the trip. this time lapse thing began with me back in 1996 and 1997. may of this year i have had something that i cannot see bothering me when i am sleeping. these things can touch you! they seem to like to poke me allot to see if it hurts. most of the time i aknowledge that whatever is there and i ask for it to go away. there are beings on this earth that are attempting to help us and there are also beings that would like to destroy humankind. these beings can jump in and out of the human body. this is my opinion about our current world-china is our biggest threat. the new world order began in 2009. the power grid and banking systems will go down. it is important to hold on and hide as much cash as you can. keep you car filled with gas and stockpile food, water and antibiotics. a sign to look for is when our military starts closing down military bases. when this occurs know that the time is near to get the heck off the east coast. i feel there is going to be nuclear war. the only safe places to go are going to be the north west. i have been working for 4 years as a cna. i work at a place called cleveland pines in shelby, nc. i love my job but it is not what i was sent here for. i want to be on the border working in montana. i am going to re-apply and try again. i found you're name on jesse ventura conspiracy theory. i think that you are doing great work! sincerely, *(wit's name and phone numbers deleted--cms\\sg) i do not have voice mail set up but i keep my phones with me at all times."],"Region":"West Virginia","Log Number":"US-11162010-0006","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26608.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26608.html"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"-81.625343","Date Submitted":"11/16/2010 12:57 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Charleston","There were no other sightings in Charleston on or around September 8th 2006"],"Case Number":"26608","Summary":"Attack on Amtrak enroute to work for Customs and Border Protection duty station Piegan, Montana"}
