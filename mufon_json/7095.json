Me and my platoon had found a box of marijuana. We thought we'd give it a shot. We weren't high, we only had 8 puffs each. Me and my platoon were looking up at the stars when we saw them flash by. It was like being fired upon by a machine gun, but they were colored alot of colors. One of the UFOs lodged into my partners chest. He said that \"they\" wanted peace, but I don't think he meant it because he shot me in the leg. I shot him the head because he was growing tentacles I think. The rest of the platoon had run off. Moments later strange, smll men with squinty eyes dragged me away. I woke up later in a cage, it was surrounded by the little men. They were speaking in a wierd language. I don't remember anything else from that awful night. The next thing I remmember was I woke up with a horrible headache in the middle of my living room. They have been watching me ever since. As I right this I know I don't have much time left on this world, but I know that MUFON needs to hear my story."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=23.928856,+38.336538(7095)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7095) map </A>","Country":"KP","Longitude":"38.336538","Case Number":"7095","Latitude":"23.928856"}
