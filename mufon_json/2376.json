The weather was mostlycloudy with a strong wind blowing north to south. The clouds were moving fast. I just happened to look up as the clouds parted and there it was. I knew theobject was not anything I had ever seen before or since. I stopped and lookedat it for about three or four seconds. The object did not move. It made nosound that I noticed. Then the clouds closed in again concealed the object. Istood watching that spot in the sky for a minute or two until the clouds openedagain but the object was not there any longer.
