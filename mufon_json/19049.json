{"Case Number":"19049","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Long Beach","Latitude":"33.810877","divs":["sighting details at 11:32 am pt on september 2nd, 2009 (today) i was driving with a friend westbound on 2nd street toward the intersection at studebaker rd. i was in the driver seat and first witnessed the object in the area shown in slide 1 of the attached re-created photo. at first i thought it was a blimp...then wasn't so sure...as we approached i pointed it out to my friend in the passenger seat-he could not see it (either because he wasn't looking right at it, or the tree's were obstructing his view. as we approached the intersection i noted that it looked almost like an enormous advertisement banner towed by a plane for those on the beach. the reason i say that is because it appeared as if there were breaks in the solid shape...like lettering...but not lettering-something else. once i noticed it did not appear to have a lead plane (towing it) and the fact that it was not at a slight angle (as most banners are) to the horizon i began to question what it was even more. i would approximate that it was wide (1x to 2x the length of a b-52 and twice as tall (as shown in a side profile)). i would estimate that the height to be twice that of a b-52. the approximate altitude would have been 6k-10k feet. i am a student pilot and aerospace engineer. after we turned the corner (onto studebaker rd) i looked to my left hand side to point out the location of the object to my passenger and it was not there. there was nothing at all in the sky. an objective observer would note that the craft approximate location shown in the attached recreated photos have similar shapes as that of the telephone pole wood horizontal supports. i witnessed this craft for 2 minutes....and there was no indication it was part of anything attached to the ground (telephone pole\\etc.). as a pilot with 50 flight hours i would hope to be able to differentiate. f-18 fighters were heard accelerating (unknown if they were taking off or merely patrolling as usual from los alimitos at 11:52am. interestingly enough the fires are still burning today...the sky in the background of the object was 'smoggy' but not much different than a very hot, smoggy day in los angeles-only this air certainly had the added particulates from the fires. another interesting fact is that there were fires burning on the same day when other objects were observed in november of 2008: http:\\\\www.ufocasebook.com\\2009\\californiatrisightingnov2008.html i would recommend that any follow up call the following agencies: los alamitos joint forces base: 562-795-2571, safety officer:795-2007 or 2005 seal beach police station watch commander: 562-799-4100 long beach air traffic control tower: 562-424-7128"],"trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Long Beach","There were no other sightings in Long Beach on or around September 2nd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-09032009-0001","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-118.150946","Summary":"Rectangular Object Sighted over Long Beach","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date of the Event":"09/02/2009 11:32 UTC","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.810877,+-118.150946(19049)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19049) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"09/03/2009 12:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19049.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19049.html"],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Other, Unknown"}
