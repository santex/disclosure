Looked up at SE sky at 2 larger-than-Jupiter, twinkling, white star-like objects about 25-30 degrees up above tree line (about an inch at arm's length apart). Thought they were strange, not only for being so large, but it puzzled me that I didn't recognize what constellation they could be in... As I wondered, the smaller light on the right faded to nothing (in about 2-3 seconds), then the larger left one did the same. The sky had some clouds that were white floating randomly across... thought perhaps a black one had passed in front, so I waited for a couple minutes while the other clouds moved across, and this was not the case... they were GONE. I call them the \"Greensburg Lights\" because that was the direction they were in from my house, and because their action was exactly like video taken of the Phoenix lights in the way they faded out."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.437402,+-79.693025(13151)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13151) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"10/21/2008 07:56 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/21/2008 07:56 UTC","Latitude":"40.437402","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-10212008-0023","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Murrysville","There was one other sighting in Murrysville on or around October 21st 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Murrysville","Summary":"Two large STAR-LIKE stationary objects just faded one at a time JUST LIKE PHOENIX LITES","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13151.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13151.html"],"Case Number":"13151"}
