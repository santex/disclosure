I did not want to take my eyes off it to run for a camera as I was in awe. I thought to my self someone else has to see this, I was so sure that someone else seen it that I watched the news to see if it had been reported but a big disappointment a big no.that is what surprised me most because it seemed to be the size of a bus.
