{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi first have to tell you that if you think you have seen more than 1 or 2 ufos or if you think one was fallowing you at one time as you drive home one night you must go back and think of your past, ask yourselves if any of the things in my story has happen to you. my story, , (\"plese contact my by email only\") part 1) i remember i was very young, maybe 3 years old, around 1962\\3, i would have nightmares and i remember them very clearly, in these nightmares i was inside a tube, and at the beginning of this tube it's top was open and my upper half of my body was out of the tube and people were watching me, some of these people were not that tall others were taller, as i was in this tube i remember crying with my right arm out, i remember i had thoughts that told me i needed to crawl quickly threw the tube to the other end before the end would closes with a lid, i knew if the lid did closed another tube would open and then i would have to crawl threw that 2nd tube, it was all very scary,,,,,,,, how could a baby of the age of 2 or 3 have such a nightmare, well it's funny how my brother had the same nightmare !!!!!!!! 2) at the age around 4, i have always remember this very clearly throughout the years but i didn't figure it out until i was in my late 30s when all things came to a understanding, i was in the downstairs front room of my mother's house (remember this downstairs window in this front room for later in my story), when i walked by the window there was this light and i remember i was in a bright white room standing at the beginning of 2 rows of people, i had no fear, one row of people was on my right side and the other row was on my left side, there was maybe 5 or 6 people in each row, at the end of these 2 rows there was someone standing in the middle, this person standing at the end was taller than all the other people,, i remember looking at all the people and then running to the tall person and he picked me up and raised me up high, at that point-on i don't know what happen, i do remember what the people were wearing, i remember i could not see these peoples faces because they were wearing masks with some-sort of hat, their top or shirt was like a yellow rain coat kids wear in the 60s, but they were shinny white with black trim, and i remember their shoes were dark and large, i remember thinking they were wearing boots because their feet were so big compared to the size of their bodies, the next thing i remember i was standing at the window and a ran to my mother in the kitchen and i told her that \"people came for me in the window\" at that point my mother ran to the front room and looked out the windows but there was no people,,,,,,, i remember all this very clearly because i was awake when it happened. 3) the age of 8 or 9, in my mothers house the upstairs floor layout is the same as downstairs, and all the windows upstairs have the same layout as downstairs, my oldest brother's bedroom was the upstairs front room and all the windows were laid out the same as downstairs, in the late 1960s my oldest brother went off to a trade school and at that time i got to sleep in his bedroom, i remember being by the window in this bedroom upstairs and a white light comes threw the window, i remember seeing the same people as i explained above, but i don't remember anything other than standing next to the window after it was over, i remember thinking \"what was that\", but i was to young to put everything in part 2 and part 3 together.. 4) about the age of 11, so now it's 1970 or 71, i remember being out side playing with my next door neighbor in a dirt pile next to my dad's garage, a plane flew over and hovered maybe 100ft off the ground, i remember telling my friend it must have been a helicopter because it was hovering, i remember my friend saying there was no noise, and he said it must be a flying saucer, i remember a white light and then nothing more.. 5) the years have gone by, it's the early 80s now, maybe 1983, so i'm 23 or 24, it's dark out side and my girl friend (now my wife) comes in and tells me there is a ufo outside in the night's sky, well my father and i out on the porch watch this ufo, it was just a round off-white light in the sky, my dad and i watch it do a 400 ft vertical figure-8 then it stopped and hovered, then in a instant it flew off traveling parallel to the mountains, no plane could do that vertical figure-8 as quick and then hover, all silently.. 6) i clearly see a ufo in the day time, september 5 1985 2.15 pm, a day i well never forget, i see a triangle, it was about 150 ft off the ground and hovering, i had a good look, it's color was dark like blueing on a gun, it was flat on it's top with no tail, and flat on it's bottom, it sides were round, there was no wings, no prop, no rotor blades and no sound, id did have a super bright light on it's transom, this light wrapped down under it transom and on the bottom, it had a white and green revolving light under it's nose, this light was about 3 time the size of a average car's headlight, it's cockpit had a canopy with pillar type supports like the turbine jets in the 1950s, yeas later when i got a computer and was hooked up to the net i reported seeing this ufo to the learning channel web site, the learning channel web site emailed me back telling me they forward my report to nuforc, see my repost in the link, http:\\\\www.nuforc.org\\webreports\\014\\s14249.html 7) 1986 and now married, i was married in 1986 and living in the upstairs apartment in my mothers house, i remember going to supper to a friends in the next town about 8 miles away, i remember it was dark on the way home and i saw a slow flying plane (or what i thought was a plane), it was flying parallel to our car, i remember one time on the way home we stopped at a store and i saw the plane flying very slow, i remember thinking it was funny because how could a plane fly so slow and make no noise and i never saw a plane that had white, red and green lights all over it, i now remember seeing those white, red and green lights more than once as i drove home at night, and they were always flying parallel to our car at the same speed,,,,,,,,,, later in my life i would put 2 and 2 together, 7a) before my son was born my wife had a miscarriage, after my son was born my bedroom was again in that upstairs front room, i remember waking-up in the middle of the night and setting on the edge of my bed telling myself \"next time i'm just going to punch them\" someone or something was in my bedroom but when i woke up they were gone, i remember my wife would not wake-up.. 8) my wife and i buy a house, we moved into this house, it a nice house in a clean quiet neighborhood, my daughter is 3 and my son is 5, now things start to get strange, we had no pets at this time, yet i remember many times being woken-up because something was on my bed and got off (you know how a bed bounces or ripples as a pet jumps off it), this happen many times 6 or 8 times and every time i woke-up but nothing was in my room, and my kid were still in their beds sleeping, and sometimes my wife was working so it was not her ether, other times i would wake-up to loud snapping, very loud snaps, but there was nothing in my room, 8a) like in 7a above one night i woke-up, i as going to set on the edge of my bed, but something stopped me, i saw a small radish\\orange light in front of my eyes, this light was a little larger round than a pencil, it was only 4 or 5 inches from my eye, after about 1\\2 a minute i laid back down and went to sleep, 8b) now thing are making me ask myself \"what's going on\" !!!!!!!!!! 9) now my daughter is 4, one night i'm in bed just about ready to fall asleep when i see a light coming from my daughter's room, i jump-up and run to her room, her door is about 5 steps from my bed, when i get to her bedroom the light was goon and she was sleeping 9a) now one day my daughter come's to me and climbs up onto my lap and she asked me (quote) \"daddy, why does it hurt when the light comes-down\", so as my mind is racing i ask her \"what light\", and she tells me \"never-mind i can't talk about it\", i ask her again and she would not tell me,, 10) the light comes for me again, so now a few years have gone by, on this day as i remember i'm in my house alone, i'm in my bed room walking around my bed, as i get close to the window a white light comes from the window and hits me in the right eye and pulls me into this bright white room, i could see someone bending-over in front of me, as i said above in #2 this person was wearing shinny white with black trim, i could not move, then i was in my bed room again, i'm sure who ever it was he\\she was doing something to my genitals but i didn't have any pain after it was over.. 10a) now i know !!!!!, i don't know who but at this point i now know what's going on, i have put it all together and i now know, they screwed-up, they were arrogant enough to take me when i was awake and i remember and i now know what's happening !!!! 11) one night i woke-up to a lot of noise in my bedroom, it was the sliding door on my closet, something was in my closet and it couldn't get out, i was awake and setting-up in bed but i could not move, i hear the sliding door on my closet rattling loudly, but i could not move, then the noise was silent and i saw something\\someone small\\short walk quickly across the end of me bed to the window, i went back to sleep but the next day i remembered what happen, i knew that they must have come for my daughter, i knew if they could move threw the glass window they could move threw wood, but this one for some reason got stuck behind the closet door, see my daughter's bedroom is right behind my closet.. 12) here i tell you how my mother's house and how my house are connected, remember i told you above in #2 to remember the \"downstairs window in the front room\" at my mother's house, and remember i told you in #3 my brother's bedroom upstairs was in the front room too and the window layout is the same the downstairs front room, and in #10 how the light came threw the window in my bedroom in my house, well here i will tell you one more thing that makes everything fit together, my bedroom is upstairs in my house, but this day i was downstairs in my house and i was walking to the tv to turn it on, well the whit light came again for me and hit me again in the right eye, well this time the white light came from the cable-box, 12a), see ????? downstairs in my mother's front room when i saw 4 there was a tv, upstairs outside my brother's bedroom window the cable wirer from the telephone poll was mounted to my mothers house, at my house the cable wire is mounted to the house outside my bedroom's window, and as i just said above in 12 the white light came for me from the cable-box,, 12b) these people, who ever they, are were ever they come from, they travel in or on the wires from the telephone poll, this is how they get into houses !!!!!!!!! 13) here i will prove how 12 & 12a is true, 5 years ago my son was 15, one evening he came to me and he told me he thought he saw a ufo as he looked out his bedroom window, he said it flew down beside our house, he said it was a blue light, he said, quote \"it looked as if the light traveled down the wires from the telephone poll, that puts it all together !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
