At first I thought it was a star but then I noticed it was moving at a steady pace. I felt a sense of urgency to take a picture of the object since this wasn't the first time I've witness a strange sighting like this. However, I've learned to always bring my camera and keep it powered on. I felt a sense of excitement after seeing the object. I lost sight of the object shortly as after taking the picture. What really surprised me is what I saw when I reviewed the photo. I didn't use the flash being that I didn't want to drown out the brightness of the object."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"45853","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"02/23/2013 10:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/24/2013 03:31 UTC","Summary":"I was sitting on my patio when I saw a peculiar bright light.
