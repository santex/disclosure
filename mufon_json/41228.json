{"Case Number":"41228","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsi was living with a friend in wyoming. he took me out one day to see the beautiful landscape and mountains, etc. as we were driving down some dirt road, i saw what reminded me of a house from the flintstones, literally all stones\\boulders. anyhow we stopped driving so i could take a picture. i was sitting in the passenger seat, and just took pictures out the window. (window was rolled down of course). i had my 35mm camera and my digital camera. i picked up one the cameras and snapped a picture, set it down, and took the same picture with the other camera. it wasnt till 2010 that i got my 35mm film developed... and it was a great picture of the little \"hut\". then i decided to finally put my memory card in a friends wii so i could look at the pics on a tv. when i came across the picture of the \"hut\" from the digital camera, i noticed an object in the sky. i enhanced the pic best i could to see what i could make of the object. its def not a smudge or plane or bird. id really like to have a professional examine the picture. if its not a ufo, id like to know what it actually is."],"Date of the Event":"09/08/2008 01:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.084418,+-107.287114(41228)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41228) map </A>","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41228.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41228.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"2 pics taken, 1 with digital, 1 with 35mm. digital caught a UFO.","Log Number":"US-07282012-0034","Date Submitted":"07/28/2012 09:46 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Wyoming","Latitude":"43.084418","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-107.287114","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
