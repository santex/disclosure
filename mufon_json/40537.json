On deck at home watching fireworks in the area. The moon had just come up above the horizon, east. I had been looking to the south from our deck at home, turned to see if we could see other fireworks to the east. When I did there was this massive fiery red diamond shaped in the sky. I asked my sister what the heck is that? We then stood memorized watching this thing. With the moon just above the horizon we'd say it was about a quarter of the size of the moon. This thing was in the forefront the moon would have been in the background. Now this was a diamond shape when you were looking at it head on, not from below. It moved very slowly to the North, there was no sound, it then moved slightly east and then slowly descended below the tree line. There we no vapor trails, no engine sounds, no flashing lights, it didn't look as if it spun or turned. Again it was massive and the whole thing seemed very surreal, both me and my sister felt pretty weird-ed out by the whole thing."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40537.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40537.html"],"trends":[],"Case Number":"40537","Log Number":"US-07072012-0015","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.887192,+-93.088782(40537)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40537) map </A>"}
