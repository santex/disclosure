{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving north on Angeles Crest Highway before getting to 210 west onramp spotted very bright lights in mountain gap above La Tuna canyon road. Thought it must be aircraft from Burbank airport. At Pennsylvania ave offramp got off and pulled onto Altura road. Got out of car. Objects were 5-6 glowing orbs (like seen on history channel in Phoenix) Could not beleive other people did not see them. They acted like they were playing--they would seperate then come together. Observed them to 2 north freeway--they were not going fast. Maybe 40 mph. I am a licensed aircraft mechanic and know port and starboard lights used by airplanes-- had none. Told family and friends did not beleive me. Objects had multi-colored lights and were just south of 210 freeway This is my second encounter with ufo's"],"Longitude":"-118.235119","Case Number":"10311","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"11/23/1987 06:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.228754,+-118.235119(10311)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10311) map </A>","Summary":"Coming home from work saw orbs just south of 210 freeway","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","City":"La Crescenta","Latitude":"34.228754","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-04132008-0016","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/23/1987 06:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10311.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10311.html"],"Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in La Crescenta","There were no other sightings in La Crescenta on or around November 23rd 1987"]}
