The weather was clear. It was about a quarter of a mile away from my girlfriend and I. It seemed to be a pentagon shape with 3 dim white lights on the top of it in a triangular pattern. There were many other lights in the middle of it. It was dark almost black. It floated from east to west, as we were facing south. It was over a place called the Baker University wetlands. We saw it for about 2 to 3 minutes and it kept going until it was out of view. It also made no noise at all and was quite large.
