It was about 11:20 PM ,that while looking in a North-West direction that I noticed two saucer-shaped objects flying together towards a South-East direction. They were flying very-very fast and turned together towards South. They looked like they had a pink=green haze around them. I've been reading about UFO's since I was 16. I also live about 10 min.from the Airport,so I know airplanes and what they look like. These were 2 disks that were flying in formation,moving exactly the speed and direction. This is my fourth sighting in all of my life. This one was really spectacular to me..and my friend! The whole incident lasted about 10 seconds....they turned to their right and disappeared behind his house. I'd say they were about at least 200 feet in diameter..and that they were moving at least 1000kph. There..had to get this off my chest. Thank you!"],"Object Features":"None"}
