Was watching the lightning show, and watching airplanes below. Looked above and seen a few bright stars peeking through, then noticed one of the stars moving quickly. got my binoculars to see closer. Was simply a orange ball, no blinking lights, moving rapidly. Object appeared above the cloudcover shining through. Object proceeded rapidly east. was at the horizon and unable to see further within a matter of 1-1.5 minutes from noticing it directly above. If it was below the clouds, I would have expected to see blinking lights of a aircraft, and also unsure what aircraft has orange lights. I will be looking up more often at early evening time. I make no assumptions on what it is...I know what it isnt and thats about it. If I see more of these objects, I will invest in getting a high quality camera and set up as much evidence gathering equipment (I am a skeptic, so I know what I would be satisfied with as far as being something more than simply a airplane or satellite.)
