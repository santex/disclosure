Driving from Gypsum to Eagle. It was dark and I all of a sudden saw something blueish green flying toward us, overhead almost horizontally but maybe at about a 150 degree angle. It was beautiful. I asked my son age 4 if he saw it and he said he didn't. I think when I actually really noticed it, it almost took me to look underneath my visor area for it was directly above us. It was huge though. I thought it was probably a meteor. So cool. But when I heard about the Needles, California sighting on the history channel, and they discribed that sighting as turqoise, I realized what I saw looked alot like the one they saw in Needles."],"Case Number":"15583","Date of the Event":"10/31/2008 12:00 UTC","City":"Gypsum","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.64693,+-106.951711(15583)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15583) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Blue green oblong fireball flying to earth in about 150 angle.","Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.64693"}
