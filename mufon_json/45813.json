Both times we were there at about 9 looking out towards the Long Island Sound. 2.It seemed irregular because it wasnt on the ground it wa in the air and not flashing- a bright reddish orange orbs. They hovered and would change locations. 3.Had and still have no idea, but it certainly wasnt any flying objects im used to seeing in the sky. 4. Made multiple formations, hovered and moved in any which direction, would go up to each other (6) so a comet like object zip by then disappear. 5.Our car light went had a power serge and we felt like an over whelming presence at one point. After we were just in complete awe, too surreal for words. 6. We got out of there, quickly."],"Date of the Event":"02/20/2013 09:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Triangle","Log Number":"US-02212013-0002","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Region":"Connecticut","Summary":"triangular formations, multiple formations, rocket that dissapered, bright reddish orange, ufo in the sea other would go to it when it flashed white","City":"Lordship","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.153889,+-73.111944(45813)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45813) map </A>","Longitude":"-73.111944","Date Submitted":"02/21/2013 01:12 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45813.html"],"Case Number":"45813","Sighting Duration":"01:30:17"}
