I had forgot my cell phone in the car. When I retrieved the phone a bright pulsating light caught my eye. The object was to the north and appeared to object heading north east. The object was moving erraticly and EXTREMELY SLOW! It would move up, down, left, and right in no particular pattern that i could tell and even pausing was times. I sat and watchd the object until the light from the sunrise and direction it was headed made it impossible to see with the naked eye. This was around 5:50. I had witnessed two identical object the night before around 3 a.m. The second object was near the same place this object was the following day. Both sightings made my hair stand on end, and gave me goosebumps."]}
