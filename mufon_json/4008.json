We were coming from Nevin Platt Middle School on Baseline Road east of Cherryvale Road, where we had just picked up Alexander. He got out of school at 15:30 and took a few minutes to get to the car, so I estimate the pictures were taken between 15:45 and 16:00. We were headed west on Baseline Road to go to Taco Bell at Baseline Road and Broadway for a snack. The low cloud formations over the Flatirons were creating some memorable images, so I stopped the car just west of the Foothills Parkway and got my Sony DSC-P41 camera out of the trunk to take some pictures. First we stopped in the parking lot of the St. Andrew Presbyterian Church at 37th Street and Baseline Road to get a clear view without the power lines going along Baseline Road. There was an open meadow toward the foothills there, so it was a good location. I took four shots. The first one was without zoom, the other three were zoomed to varying degrees. I estimate the time here as about three minutes total, arriving in the parking lot no sooner than 15:45. [The second shot, I just realized as I reviewed the pictures to write this report, had a UFO in it, too!!! There was a radiant diamond shape in front of the tree line on the far side of the meadow! We didn���t notice that last night! So I have included this image as well as the other along with this report, and have modifed the Short Description narrative of the report to include this. While taking all these pictures, I was oblivious to anything UFO related going on.] After shooting in the church parking lot, I proceeded west on Baseline Avenue and took two more shots; one without zoom just after leaving St. Andrews and another zoomed some while near Taco Bell. After we went through Taco Bell, I went south on Broadway to Ash Avenue, where I turned east and immediately turned north and came to a stop on the corner of Ashley Lane. I estimate arrival to this spot to be no earlier than 15:55. Here I had a great, unobstructed, close-up view of a stretch of the Flatirons and took a slightly zoomed shot to eliminate the foreground and capture a nice scene. A few seconds later, waiting for some traffic on Broadway to clear, I took a second shot of the same scene to make sure I had a good image. Then we went home, a few blocks away in the Martin Acres neighborhood. I wish to note that all images were taken from the driver���s seat of my 2003 Oldsmobile Alero, with the window fully down to get a good resolution. When we arrived home, we were talking about differing things and planning the evening activities, then I started looking at the images through the view screen on the camera. The first thing I noticed was an anomaly on an image Alexander had taken last Saturday morning as we passed through Castle Rock, CO on I-25 southbound going to a soccer game in Colorado Springs. [This image was on the same memory stick and I am submitting a second report to you regarding this other incident after I complete this one.] When I zoomed up on the glowing form above a hot air balloon he had captured, I got excited and I told Alexander he may have inadvertently photographed a UFO. Then I decided to download all the images on the computer and look more closely at Alexander���s shot on the computer screen. When I did, I decided to print it out, along two blow-ups of the anomaly. As I prepared to do this, I took a quick look at the last two images I had photographed of the Flatirons to see how they turned out. I was stunned to notice a glowing spot in the clouds on the second image. When I zoomed in on it, it appeared to be a pattern of four lights arranged in a circle or diamond pattern in the sky shining through the clouds. Then I went about printing an 8��� x 11 inch photo of this and the other image, and making two enlargements of both these anomalies. I made the enlargements with Corel Photo-Paint 8 and digitally saved them as separate images. This was all very exciting to me, as I have had many sightings in my 56 years of living, but never have had the blessing of capturing any of them with a camera. Victoria and I had attended the recent MUFON event in Denver. We were moved by the documentary we saw of compiled evidence from a Mexican journalist. Victoria then saw two UFO���s seemingly playing with one another in the sky off C-470 near Lone Tree, CO, the next morning as she went to work. After that, I had prayed for an opportunity to get a photograph or video, but had no idea I was photographing any of them yesterday. And to discover while preparing this report today that I serendipitously photographed two separate ones within 15 minutes was wild! And unbelievably, the encounter was not yet over. While I was immersed in the profundity of having finally captured a UFO on camera and the delight of my son preceding me with his picture from last weekend, Alexander noticed a red balloon we had placed behind the horn of a bison skull hanging on a wall of my living room last Friday evening was beginning to shrivel. He also noticed the seven others in the room I had brought home for him from a celebration at the Denver VA Medical Center I had attended last Thursday were just fine. So he pulled it down and examined it. After a few moments, Alexander told me there was a hand print somewhat smaller than his on the balloon. This was curious enough to get my attention, and we continued to examine it together. I have decided to detail this in another report to you immediately following this one. I was convinced that there was a strong possibility an alien entered my home Tuesday evening and handled this object, leaving some remarkable impressions which I have documented with my digital camera and a video. Indeed, at this point, I am ready to methodically document all my encounters with your organization and you will be hearing more from me. And I am reasonably certain I now possess an extremely valuable artifact providing evidence of an alien presence, so I hope to be in contact with one of your associated scientists in the near future for a scientific analysis of the balloon and the apparently heat or chemically-formed impressions on its surface where it was handled by some unknown life-form.
