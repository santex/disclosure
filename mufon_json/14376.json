{"divs":["sighting detailsat approximately 9:30pm last night 12\\11\\08, i was on my way home from class traveling on a lone country roadway; it was a clear, cold, and dark night with no haze or fog overhead. i have never seen a ufo before but do believe that they exist. what i saw can be described as a large, bright object that seemed at first like a meteor falling at a 110 degree angle, but without the trajectory trail as i have seen before in the past; the object seemed much larger that a meteor and much closer than something falling from space. i observed the object only for a few seconds as it descended below the horizon, probably around 3 or 4 seconds. as i got home and told my girlfriend about it, i recalled that when i saw the object i was driving right by the graveyard, and this made me wonder if this was in relation to a different kind of phenomena. whatever it was, i will probably wonder about it was for many years. it is time for our government to come clean."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"14376","Latitude":"29.680507","Date of the Event":"11/30/2002 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-12122008-0003","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Luling","There were no other sightings in Luling on or around November 30th 2002"],"Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","City":"Luling","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.680507,+-97.647498(14376)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14376) map </A>","Summary":"Bright falling object.","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"11/30/0002 09:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like, Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-97.647498","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14376.html"]}
