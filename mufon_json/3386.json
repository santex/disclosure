I think it was some time around 8:00 or 8:30 PM. It was night, I know. I saw some lights in the sky. There were two that were very white. They looked like stars, at first. But they moved in unison. There were to other that were multicolored. They may have actually been a series of multiple, smaller, different colored lights. I think it was just one large craft, because all the lights moved together. It wasn t moving to quickly at first, just drifting across the sky. At first I thought it was just a few planes that happened to be flying close to the ground. However, I realized there was no reason that two planes would flying so close, and traveling at the same velocity. After about five minutes the craft began to move faster into the distance. It continued to fly away, increasing speed and altitude as it went until I couldn t see it anymore. I discussed it with my family for a while, until we decided to report it to some organization and we found MUFON."],"City":"Crystal Lake"}
