When I navigated to street level, the images on photos attached were captured on the screen. It looks like something glowing punches through the sky and a glowing orb is in the right side near the street. You can see it if you zoom in on the picture It looks like it's traveling fast with a tail behind it. Here are the Google earth locations. 34 13' 10\" N 97 58' 47\" W. Altitude 8ft. 33 13' 10\" N 97 58' 47\" W. Altitude 8ft. I have other pictures I took from other angles if needed. Please let me know if there is an explanation that I'm unaware of. Or what your opinion is. I'm not technically savy at all (lol) but did my best to give you some information to work with. There does seem to be a lot of unexplained sightings in this remote area. Thanks so much for your help. It's much appreciated.
