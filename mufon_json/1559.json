This evening, 04 Mar 2002 at approx. 1925 hours EST, I was with my dog,outside of my home in the town of Kane, Pa. and I looked up to see an aircrafttraveling west to east. The aircraft had standard exterior lighting and itsounded like a jet. At that time I noticed the star like object crossing thepath of the aircraft (maintaining seperation).2. The aircraft continued out ofsight, south of me traveling west to east and the jet noise was gone with it. 3. The star looking object flew (at an aircraft like speed) southwest tonortheast with its path slightly east of my location until it was out of sightin the distant sky.4. Because it it looked star like and showed no wing tip oranticollision lights and made no sound that I could hear (unlike the manyaircraft that I see and hear daily), to me it was an unidentifiable object.5. Iremember seeing one like it traveling a similar flight path a few months ago,and though I wondered about it, I failed to note the time and date I made noreport. -- WJC"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Case Number":"1559"}
