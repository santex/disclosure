I did not see it the first time, but my parents and grandmother did. What they described to me was what I saw last night. First sighting was on July 5 around 10 PM. I was upstairs getting ready for bed when my Dad came and got me and told me to come outside and see it. We ran downstairs and out the back door onto the deck and observed the lights moving towards the west from the southwest. Appeared to have three lights in an obtuse triangular pattern. The light farthest to the rot from our vantage point seemed to disappear, leaving only the other two. They then continued to move towards the west. They eventually disappeared into the cloud cover. There was no sound at all from them. No flashing lights like on an aircraft. I was initially shocked, and kind of upset because I didn't believe my parents and grandmother 100% when they told me about the first sighting in July. I know it was not a conventional aircraft and was not flares."],"Summary":"Orangish-red lights over Dallas, Pa"}
