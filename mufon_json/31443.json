This light did not blink or flicker like a star and moved too slow to be a meteor or falling object from orbit. It continued on a steady flight path across our field of vision in the night sky and its path was actually crossed by an unmistakable commercial airliner which we used to judge objects size and speed with. The light appeared to be bigger than the plane and moving at a similar speed as the plane. Shortly after the plane crossed behind object, the light slowed to a halt and dimmed away as if it was on a dimmer switch"],"Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"35.390596","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.390596,+-97.720937(31443)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31443) map </A>","City":"Mustang","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"31443","Date Submitted":"09/02/2011 06:46 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31443.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31443.html"],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Mustang","There were no other sightings in Mustang on or around September 1st 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09022011-0044","Summary":"strange moving light in sky"}
