It was almost directly above me when I saw a white light suddenly appear in front of it. It accelerated with starting speed and missed the jet from above, slowing and halting in probably 1 second flat. It hovered as I sat bewildered. I wanted to get a size comparison of the light itself and the jet, but at the time the jet had moved on behind the roof of the car, so I had to crane my neck to see it. By the time I looked back to find the light, it had disappeared and I didn't see it again afterwards. From my memory, it was probably either the same size as the jet, or a little over half the size."],"City":"Columbia","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02292012-0020","Latitude":"38.960435","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36174.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36174.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Was watching a jet fly when suddenly, a white light appeared and charged the jet extremely fast.
