{"Latitude":"41.741472","Date Submitted":"02/29/1972 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["sighting details i want to start by saying the reason i am reporting this incident almost 35 years after the fact is my experience differs slightly from any report i have ever read about.i respect your quest for knowledge on this particular subject.i hope you can appreciate my tale.it does have the added advantage of being true. my\\our story,there were three friends with me,is different because before we saw the object we all shared a beep in our ears and i do mean in our ears,no apparent direction.a very generic sounding beep,not loud,soft,not horn like but like i don't know,like the beep your microwave makes when you press a button.when i heard the beep i stopped talking,as we were all having conversation.everybody else stopped talking also at the same time and after a long pause of nobody talking i asked did you guys hear that beep?everybody in unison said yes some loudly.you see it was weird.we didn't have a whole lot of stuff that beeped back in 1972,especially inside a 1961 oldsmobile!well thats the short of the long why this story is different,the inside the ear type beep. i was driving with my buddys just south of the missesinewa reservoir at night and yes in the country.we often went there around the reservoir to swim,hunt,and other things teenage boys do with girls,beer,etc. t. when they don't have there own place yet. we heard the beep!one of my buddies yells what the f**k is that?all in the car started yelling for me to pull over.i did.i looked and half a mile plus away from us hovering,soundless and motionless at above and below tree top level a huge glowing reddish orange,cigar shaped or disc shaped ufo!150 possibly 300 feet long.i hate to be vague on the shape but the object never moved and we were a long way away its possible that we were looking at a disc that was almost perfectly horozontal to the ground and at our eye level.the object was definately a glowing 3d thing not a light or a gas.the object had a row of lights on or very near the bottom of it.they very well have been windows with the inside light was shining out.the row of lights were white and not brighter than the reddish orange glow of the rest of the hovering object.there was a brighter light on one end of the row of lights that shone down a few times spot light like not a narrow beam.this light only this white light shone white on the trees and the ground.the overall reddish orange glow of the object was deep not as bright and illuminated only the surrounding trees not the ground.the row of lights flickered a few at a time and at the time it looked to me more like movement of something behind a window in a well lit room rather than a light flickering.we were far away but this thing was a big boy possibly with big windows.i stared at this hovering light show and bam i realised it was a classic 50's style ufo only difference was there wasn,t a dome on the top of it.we stood there in real shock and awe.one of my buddies yells lets get close.in my mind this is were my story may ring true to y'all.though curious this was all to real to me a profound moment in my life.it was scary.i wasn't going any closer to the ufo.john wayne would not have gone closer.so many accounts of ufo sightings has the witness trudging right off to get as close or even touch these objects.in other words the hero of their story.after what i experienced,i say yeah right.my buddy who said lets get close knew we weren't going to drive up on that object.he was playing macho man.it was too real.we watched the object never venturing more than a yard from the car.it.by the way the car showed no effect from the ufo.after 5 minutes the object simply dissapeared.we all saw the samething as well as heard the beep the only sound this ufo made.oh!i know that many feel there is a possible connection between ufo's and military nuke bases.grissom air force base is 15 miles due east of where we saw the object."],"Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc","City":"Michigan City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Michigan City","There were no other sightings in Michigan City on or around February 29th 1972"],"Summary":"WE four were driving along and all of us heard a beep in our ears! that made us look around for then origin of the beep.we then saw the object,hovering at and above tree level!","Log Number":"US-02242007-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6447.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6447.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/29/1972 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"6447","Longitude":"-86.859406","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.741472,+-86.859406(6447)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6447) map </A>","Region":"Indiana","Tags":"City"}
