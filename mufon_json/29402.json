{"Date of the Event":"06/04/2011 11:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Canada","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Piercing light hovers for 2 minutes then glides over my house and a second object appears where the original hovered before.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was checking my computer, and i noticed a piercing light hovering over some houses 200 feet away. I originally thought it was a plane of sorts, until i went outside and watched it for 2 - 2:30 minutes just hover. As i was watching it started to glide right above me and i could make out a boomerang shape and some smaller colorful lights pulsating and flashing. When it went out of sight i looked at the original spot I saw it hovering and noticed a second object doing the same thing as the first, just without a very bright light. It circled my house as if wanting my attention and then flew away. I know this couldn't of been a plane because of its extremely slow speeds when gliding over my house, and it was close enough to rule out it seeming to be slow. I tried to take a video with my blackberry but i couldn't figure out how to zoom so its a pretty useless video. Also, on the brighter side, Go Canucks Go!"],"Longitude":"-122.591449","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Maple Ridge","There were no other sightings in Maple Ridge on or around June 4th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"British Columbia","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/05/2011 03:03 UTC","Log Number":"CA-06052011-0004","City":"Maple Ridge","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"49.226","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29402.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29402.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.226,+-122.591449(29402)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29402) map </A>","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Case Number":"29402"}
