(which i have seen) it was not traveling that fast, it had no tail, and commets\\meteors do not shine a light on you. it disapered going north east into the sky. we are still in awe of what we saw. thank you for your time."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13673.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13673.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"11/01/2008 06:06 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Rialto","There were no other sightings in Rialto on or around November 1st 2008"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Rialto","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
