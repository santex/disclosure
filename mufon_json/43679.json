Airplanes don't have that many lights and they are not as bright as these were then it just disappeared... this was the first one. About a mile down the road we witnessed the same exact thing then the third one was the exact same shape size everything.....I believe in aliens so I know that what I saw was an alien spaceship... too close to mistake it for anything else. All three of them just disappeared. All of the sudden, they were gone. I know they're coming and they're coming soon. I thought it was awesome and amazing."],"Latitude":"41.618245","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
