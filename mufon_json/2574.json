The craft passed almost directly overhead and then made what I woulddescribe as an almost 90 degree turn to the North, and continued on until out ofsite.The estimated duration from when I first saw the light to when the craftdisappeared from view as it headed North was approximately 5-7 seconds.The craft appeared to be dark gray in color, and had what appeared to be asingle amber colored beacon light underneath. During the sighting there wasabsolutely no sound heard by me or the other two witnesses. I wasnt able todetermine the crafts shape until it passed almost directly overhead. As far assize comparison, The rough estimate of the craft as viewed from the ground couldbe compared to a quarter held at arms length against the night sky.My immediate impression regarding the craft was that it seemed to flyeffortlessly through the sky, like an arrow."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2574.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2574.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"Triangular shaped craft","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
