{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting out having a smoke and saw a circle I passed it off as a bird because their wings dont always show up at high altitudes but as soon as I thought that it disappeared like a whomp lol disintigrating. It was coming from the west and heading southwest but disappeared. I thought it was a light trick on a bird so I waited for a while and nothing showed back up. I was feeling wowed and noticed it wasn't like the usual ships I see around here. lol I am feeling tired and its an hour later. I didn't lost sight of the object it just disappeared. How do explain that? Cool stuff! XD I swear I didn't call those ships in! No communications with it either. This photo isn't it but its the closest picture that fits the description."],"Longitude":"-87.74228","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.725663,+-87.74228(48230)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48230) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48230.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48230.html"],"Summary":"Metallic sphere flying then disappears in midday!","City":"Oak Lawn","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/18/2013 03:52 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Case Number":"48230","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Latitude":"41.725663","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Oak Lawn","There were no other sightings in Oak Lawn on or around June 18th 2013"],"Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-06182013-0019","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/18/2013 07:50 UTC"}
