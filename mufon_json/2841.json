Date was January 31, 2004 at 1800 hours. Looked like an aircraft on long final but all traffic that night was right base and this light hovered for 25 minutes over the western part of Billings and then vanished after 25 minutes. Initially thought it may be an aircraft bucking a strong headwind but winds were calm. Object did move 5 degrees diagonaly to our right but then moved 5 degrees back to the left. Estimated altitude was 7000-8000 AGL at a distance of 9 miles. Size and shape was indeterminable but light was very bright such as a landing light and the light pulsed with a faint blue tint."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.783286,+-108.50069(2841)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2841) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-108.50069","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Billings","There were no other sightings in Billings on or around January 31st 2003"],"Date Submitted":"01/31/2003 08:00 UTC","Summary":"Bright pulsating light"}
