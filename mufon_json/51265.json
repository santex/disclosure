{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Dome, Appendage(s), Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI have a trail cam that takes pictures of any motion. When I checked my computer this picture was taken by the camera. The object appears to be hovering above the ground based on the shadow.The white block in the background sitting on a stump is a salt block for the deer to lick. I then went to the area of the picture and looked for evidence. I didn't see any markings or anything that would explain the object to be anything other than a UFO. I would appreciate some feedback and thoughts pertaining to this photograph."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/02/2013 02:01 UTC","Case Number":"51265","Country":"United States","Latitude":"43.326206","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Tags":"City","Summary":"Trail Cam took picture of bright blue object hovering above the ground.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Grant","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-85.98565","Object Shape":"Oval","Log Number":"US-10022013-0010","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/27/2013 02:04 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.326206,+-85.98565(51265)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51265) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51265.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51265.html"],"City":"Grant"}
