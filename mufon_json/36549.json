It literally, appeared from directly over the roof at which point I was able to see the craft very clearly and at a very low altitude. It was triangular in shape with rounded edges and a holographic pattern lined the bottom of the craft emitting the view of the Crystal clear night sky. I pointed for my girlfriend to follow it however, by the time she could look it was obstructed by trees. It's heading was from the Southeast moving rapidly, and without sound towards the north west. It had to have flown directly over highway 41. I'm reporting this instantly, as Im utterly shocked at the magnitude and speed of this object. When i first noticed the object I thought it was a satellite until I realized how low the object actually was. My girlfriend did not see this in time, but my reaction was awe and excitement."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03182012-0002","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.445125,+-88.0987(36549)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36549) map </A>","Region":"Wisconsin","Case Number":"36549","Longitude":"-88.0987","Summary":"No joking, i actually saw a large ufo in De Pere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36549.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36549.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/18/2012 03:01 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"De Pere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"44.445125","Date of the Event":"03/18/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Unknown","Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
