Though they might have been street lights but as I got closer I saw they were moving, but very slowly. I get even closer and they look like thy will be going directly over my car. As I pass underneath I look up and see that there are 2 sets of groups of lights. 3 bright white lights with 2 blue light offsetting the white ones. They made no sound. No blinking lights. I've never seen any light formations like this and move so slowly.
