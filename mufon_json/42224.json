They each seemed to pulsate an orange-yellow light. There was no noise. They seemed to be a few miles away at about 45 degrees from the horizon. Over a period of approx 15 minutes they silently moved across the sky, eventually disappearing into the clouds in the SW. They moved in a straight line. Initially thought was a hot air balloon, but discarded idea because they were silent and moved in straight path in almost total darkness."],"Tags":"City"}
