SMITHFIELD AVE. NEAR MINERAL SPRING AVE. STEPPED OUTSIDE FOR A SMOKE , I WAS PEERING INTO THE NIGHT SKY AS I HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF DOING LATELY SINCE I HAVE SEEN A FEW ODDITIES OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND HAVE REPORTED ALL BUT ONE SO FAR, WHEN I NOTICED A WHITE STAR LIKE OBJECT SAILING ACROSS THE SKY AT A MODERATE PACE FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST. THE OBJECT WAS WHITE AND ABOUT 3 TIMES BRIGHTER THAN A STAR IN THE BIGGER DIPPER { AS AN EXAMPLE }. THERE WAS NO SOUND, NO TRAIL, NO FLASHING. IT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE IN THE OUTER ATMOSPHERE. THE DURATION OF THIS SIGHTING WAS ONLY ABOUT 15 SECONDS AT 8:10 PM. I KEPT MY EYE ON IT UNTIL IT SAILED OUT OF SIGHT."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-71.405995","Date of the Event":"09/16/2012 08:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42616.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42616.html"],"Region":"Rhode Island","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"Pawtucket"}
