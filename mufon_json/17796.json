I have seen this UFO before. It was not trying to conceal itself very well do to the fact IT WAS BRIGHT ORANGE and flickering! It was traveling WEST towards Kokomo High. It was slowing down stopping frequently and speeding up. I would have to say the slowest it was going at one point was 20MPH about 1000FT. If anyone else saw this please contact me @ 271-1833."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in Kokomo","There was one other sighting in Kokomo on or around July 4th 2009"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Kokomo","Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"40.494527","Region":"Indiana","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.494527,+-86.123883(17796)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17796) map </A>","Longitude":"-86.123883","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17796.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17796.html"],"Case Number":"17796","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
