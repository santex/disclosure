It was a clear sky during the sighting. I have a canon z900 camcorder and often i film the moon in night vision, with the camera on a tri-pod. That evening i set up my camera and zoomed in, to my suprise there was what seemed to be a verry black dot on the far right bottom of the moon. The object seemed to pass the bottom of the moon and i could no longer see it anymore. When i downloaded to my computer, i got a better look at it and found that it was a stationary object in front of the moon, what seems to be a translucent triangle with large black spots on each point of the triangle as well as a thin black line conecting the dots. The moon passed the object, and i could no longer see it, but to me the object was stationary. camera was on 40 zoom and night vision, lense was clean, nothing in the path of my field of view for obstruction. i am at a loss for an explination."],"Case Number":"18669","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-113.414578","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"08/09/2009 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Beaumont","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
