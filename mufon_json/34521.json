I had gone outside to view the night sky prior to leaving for a New Year's Eve Celebration. After viewing the first one, I asked my friends to come out and see the others. They were moving from the North to the Southeast. They appeared to move at the speed and altitude of a small private plane. However, they were not the right color to be either landing lights or red and green navigation lights. The entire object appeared to be illuminated. They traveled at the same speed and in the same direction approximately 30 seconds apart. They made no sound as they traversed the sky. As a point of reference, commercial airliners were also visible, traveling much higher, displaying conventional lights and making normal jet sounds. Several minutes after the first four passed across the sky and traveled out of sight, a fifth, single one also appeared following the same path."],"Latitude":"36.434593","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.434593,+-77.911932(34521)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34521) map </A>","Longitude":"-77.911932","Log Number":"US-01022012-0007","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
