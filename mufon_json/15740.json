I know the government claims it has put all of the F117's out of commission as of summer last year, but I was clearly buzzed at about 300-400 ft above ground by an F117 heading North as well along the 395 HWY just after leaving Lancaster. It was less than half a mile away from the vehicle and both my nephew and I saw a clear side profile and top down view as it banked on a turn. Clearly the signature triangular cockpit with swept wings and the two tail rudders in a V-shape. I know this has been the source of many UFO sightings and it's worth the knowledge that this jet is back in commission for sure. Unfortunately I wasn't able to photograph it because I was driving and my nephew doesn't know how to use my manual SLR."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.696555,+-118.144513(15740)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15740) map </A>","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Lancaster","There were no other sightings in Lancaster on or around February 19th 2009"],"Latitude":"34.696555","Date Submitted":"02/19/2009 10:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"F117 back in commission and testing."}
