I was star gazing when I noticed a light that would resemble any other satellite movement. It appeared bluish-white, tiny star like sized, moving at a slow rate. It was definitely well up in the atmosphere, or perhaps stratosphere. I watched the light move in a north-easterly direction, then about 20 seconds of watching this light, it started turning orange-white... It then flared for about 2 seconds before it vanished. There were no clouds, and the moon was not present. Very clear view. There were other very obvious airplanes in their normal traffic patterns."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Jacksonville Beach","There were no other sightings in Jacksonville Beach on or around November 21st 2008"],"City":"Jacksonville Beach","Case Number":"13909","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-81.396134"}
