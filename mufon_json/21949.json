{"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","divs":["Sighting DetailsHi Last night at 1.20am friday the 19 of February 2010 I was out side looking over Donegal bay when i saw what looked like a plane or something with lights on it hovering high in the sky. Then it just dropped from high in the horizon to just above the mountains. (At insane speed, not possible!) I first thought it was a star or a satelite but then the movement made me think other wise! It then hovered and moved right to left and diagonally and in every direction. Now i'm no expert but it was moving at a speed and in a way that defied physics !!! I've never seen anything like this before, i called my 62 yr old dad to come out to see it and we watched it for about 5 mins, he was shocked as well !! I just felt a bit stumped because i knew what ever it was it defied logic ! The object stayed for about 5 mins and then just flew away from me until i couldn't see it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21949.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21949.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"21949","Date Submitted":"02/20/2010 01:41 UTC","Summary":"Flying object over Donegal Bay, Ireland, Europe","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Sligo","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Country":"Ireland","Latitude":"54.270601","Log Number":"IE-02202010-0005","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sligo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=54.270601,+-8.471644(21949)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21949) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/19/2010 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-8.471644","Region":"County Sligo","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Diamond","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
