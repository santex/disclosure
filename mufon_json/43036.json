Could it be the island Ischia ??? It was similar to the Phoenix Lights with no flashing however the lights were constant and wavering a bit and in a row. We didn't take a photo. We weren't alarmed or dismayed at the time. However it did seem strange. The following morning and subsequent days we observe that part of the sea and in no way could it have been the lights of another town. However if it was an object it was massive hovering over the sea in complete silence and obscurity.. Regards"],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
