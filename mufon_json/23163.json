After running back up to the roof it was gone (or so i thought). i walked back downstairs to the other witnesses. They were still looking up and said it moved very fast gong east and suddenly stopped again. They pointed it out to me again and i spotted it farther east but it wasn't moving. had the vallets keep an eye out on it but it was gone after talking to them. i have always been a skeptic but i cant figure out what the hell that was. felt a need to document it and found this site. good luck."],"Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around May 4th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"05/06/2010 04:50 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-118.375886","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"round white almost shiny","Log Number":"US-05062010-0009","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/04/2010 03:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23163.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23163.html"],"Case Number":"23163"}
