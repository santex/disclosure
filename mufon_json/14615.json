{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving toward Concord, NH on I-93 South. At about 7:25pm I looked up in the sky and saw 3 lights that looked to be in a triangular pattern. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and passed directly over my truck. It would have to be about 1500 - 3000 feet elevation. It was black triangle. It stood out because it was below the clouds and I could see the outline pretty good because of the contrast between the lighter clouds and darker traingular object. The lights were white and circular with one at each corner of the triangle. I saw it for about 15-20 seconds. There was also a plane of some sort following what looked to be around the same altitude. It was traveling considerably slower than the first craft. There was also no blinking lights that I coud see on the black triangle. I attached a drawing. It was quickly down but it looked pretty much like that. It looked to be a equilateral triangle."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"New Hampshire","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Latitude":"43.213497","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/29/2008 07:25 UTC","City":"Concord","Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/29/2008 07:25 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.213497,+-71.531302(14615)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14615) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Concord","There were no other sightings in Concord on or around December 29th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Black triangular ship with a light at the 3 corners.","Longitude":"-71.531302","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14615","Log Number":"US-12302008-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14615.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14615.html"]}
