I was only about eight years old. I dont remember the exact date. I know it would have had to been before 78 because I moved from Lansdale to Harleysville Pa. Anyhow, this is what happened. I was with some friends hanging out at the Oak Park school in Lansdale Pa. I grew up on Pine street which intersects the school property. I was on the school Property with some friends on what I believe was later in the day. It was summer and it was one of those days where you could see a large full moon. The moon was lined up towards my house on Pine street so we were looking towards my house from the school. We saw a very large object orbit the moon starting from the top and working its way to the bottom. As it got to the backside it disapered. I could have not been the only one on this day to see this. I think that the object was too big to be man made. It looked like a meteor but I dont think the moon has much gravity to make a big object orbit. Any ideas? Please drop me an email."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.247885,+-75.281616(26211)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26211) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Lansdale","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/29/2010 11:06 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"something orbiting the moon","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26211.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26211.html"],"Log Number":"US-10292010-0031"}
