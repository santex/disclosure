We were coming toward the intersection of Highway 30 and 10th street when I noticed a light on the other side of the valley, toward the east, on the opposite side of I84. I pointed it out to my wife, and she thought it was strange too. When then noticed two other lights climbing after it. They were amber in color, and we ruled them out as planes because they were ascending at a 90 degree angle, and none of the lights were flashing. We parked our car on the side of Hughes lane to observe the lights some more. The lights then formed what appeared to be an equilateral triangle, They then one by one slowly dimmed in succession until they were no longer visible. We were both puzzled by this. We could tell that the lights were not satellites because when we first noticed them, they were against a hill. They later climbed above the horizon. This is the second sighting in the Baker Valley this week."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"44.777485","Case Number":"30088","Longitude":"-117.833275","Date Submitted":"07/10/2011 02:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30088.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30088.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle"}
