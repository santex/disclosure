Laying back I saw a satellite moving along a S-N trajectory at approximately 70 degrees above the east horizon. I watched it until the satellite was out of view. After another few minutes(7:50PM) I caught something out of the corner of my eye. Looking up, I first thought that it was one of the military fighters that fly over our house occasionally. The manner of flight seemed too slow (floating? effortless?). Even though the hot tub was running I did not hear any sound from the object. I then wondered if it were a bird, perhaps an owl. I then fully recognized the shape as an equilateral triangle with very faint amber colored lights on each of the corners. The corners looked rounded. It seemed as if it were shrouded in a haze or mist. It traveled in a SSW-NNE trajectory at between 80-85 degrees overhead between 300-500 feet elevation. As I watched the object faded and disappeared. The incident lasted around 5 seconds."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Henderson","There were no other sightings in Henderson on or around October 18th 2011"],"Latitude":"36.068195","Longitude":"-115.027516","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32708.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32708.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"32708","Date of the Event":"10/18/2011 07:50 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-10192011-0001","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Equilateral triangle with amber corner lights in Henderson, NV."}
