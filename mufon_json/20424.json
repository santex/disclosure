The first one came on, stayed in position a few seconds, then moved to the left in a straight line amd went out. Almost as soon as it did, a second did the same thing. After the 2nd light went out, two more appeared at once, motionless. Then they, too, moved at the same time to the left in a straight line and went out. I turned just in time to see the last light before it went out. We continued on to the next town 10 miles away and were there only 20 minutes or so and headed back. A few minutes after we got on the highway, she saw the same thing happen, not far from the area of the first sighting."],"Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dublin","There were no other sightings in Dublin on or around November 9th 2009"],"City":"Dublin","Summary":"Red lights appear stationary, move laterally then blink out","Log Number":"US-11092009-0032","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"11/09/2009 11:44 UTC","Case Number":"20424","Longitude":"-98.332358"}
