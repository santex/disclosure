Something told me to look out the window of my deck door which I had open. Just as I did, I saw a bright green light fly over my apartment building. It was a round shape and the color of it was the same as a green light on a traffic light. It made no sound but was flying very,very fast! It also seemed to be descending. I have never seen anything like it bjpefore, and after it passed I just laid there for awhile not knowing what to think. I forgot to mention that I lost sight of it when it flew over another apartment building across the street."],"Longitude":"-88.783318","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06302013-0011","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"43.79344","Date Submitted":"06/30/2013 08:23 UTC","trends":[]}
