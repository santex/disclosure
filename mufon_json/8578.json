I went into the house for some water and then went back to the tent. I looked to the north and saw what was a battle going on. I knew I was not dreaming because I just came from the house. It looked like there were many objects exploding and shooting at each other. I watched this for about 15 minutes in awe, as I could not believe what I was seeing. Better them than us, I remember thinking. Back to sleep. Again I say, \"If I can remember this for 30 years, it happened.\""],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Kentucky"}
