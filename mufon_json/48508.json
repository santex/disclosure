I watched it for approximately 15 or 20 seconds until the tree's in my yard obscured my vision. Then I ran to the back of my house and waited for it to come out from the cover of the trees, but it never came out and I didn't see it again. I can't say for sure that it was anything extraordinary, but it was something I have never seen in the sky before."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Observed redish orange craft moving across the sky moving northwesterly","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/29/2013 10:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/29/2013 11:04 UTC"}
