This is the 2nd report I am filing with you. Me and my neighbors friend were sitting on our porch talking about the events of the evening. I looked up and to my left and seen what looked like something coming towards us from the east, moving slowly with a brownish reddish glow. No noise. Silent..I pulled her into the yard and said look, do you see that, tell me if you do or not. She said, What the heck is that? By that time is was directly to our left some and it was low enough that we could see it was a triangle and had a brownish reddish tint to it as if illuminated for night. It was the type of illumination at night when a tent has a night light on it it and your are outside looking at it. Very soft lighting. I sent her inside to get my son and his friend. By the time they came out to look at this one, it was further to the west but he also seen it but not as close as we did..Very beautiful indeed..Just like it was floating past us just cruising on a Saturday night.."]}
