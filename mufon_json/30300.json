{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsSo I was on my way home from work, around midnight (the bewitching hour) when I saw a bright flash above my car probably going the speed of light. I've seen these flashes before, as they are quite common in my general neighborhood. I've notice flashes like this, but not quite large, my entire existence. So I get out of my car and notice the door is unlocked, which is very peculiar because I always lock my door to prevent the neighbors kids from getting in an getting on my computer. I see a dim light permiating from the living room and I go in there and find something I've never seen before!! It's some sort of crude being, obviously not from this galaxy, but having smooth skin all over and an elongated head, neck, and tail-like appendage. The form disappeared suddenly as soon as I took the picture, which was very strange because I thought they normally like their picture being taken? Oh well. If you have seen this being before or it has entered your house and not harmed, only frightened you, please do not contact me."],"trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Columbia","There was one other sighting in Columbia on or around July 22nd 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-81.025724","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"South Carolina","Date Submitted":"07/22/2011 06:55 UTC","Disposition":"Hoax","Case Number":"30300","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.00278,+-81.025724(30300)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30300) map </A>","Country":"United States","Summary":"Sudden encounter when I turned around","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07222011-0011","Latitude":"34.00278","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30300.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30300_submitter_file1__alien_in_living_room.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30300_submitter_file1__alien_in_living_room.jpg.1","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30300.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Columbia","Date of the Event":"07/22/2011 06:10 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Tags":"City"}
