Last night was the most insane experience of my life, massive amounts of UFO activity. It went on for 2 hours (10pm-12am) or so, at times there was one hovering directly over my house. Whatever this was knew i was there, and knew I was watching it. At one point I got a clear look at the craft, looked to be cigar shaped silver craft. At one point it just got closer and closer and I was even startled by how close it got and how well I could make it out. There appeared to be something around it that I can only compare to a humming birds wings These things mimic air planes, and stars to avoid detection. As I said I have seen these objects for four nights in a row, so I made it a point to go outside with my camera at half time of the NBA finals game."],"Region":"Michigan","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Lansing","There was one other sighting in Lansing on or around June 12th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
