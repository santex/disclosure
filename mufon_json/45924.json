I quickly had my friends look up and 3 other people seen the object move in the sky so I know I wasn't crazy. ,The lights were I say to be 10 times bigger then the airplane lights that were up in the sky that night. This also only moved 1 way really fast and then dissapeared over Wilmington CA after going through a cloud almost invisible looking. It could of been 1 object with 3 lights or 3 objects moving together in a traingle form. We kept looking up all night to see if maybe it was a big party light they use sometimes but this was over a area that would never have a light in the sky. We only seen it one time so im sure it wasn't party light. Also it went through the only Cloud that was at the time above us. Maybe to hide itself."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"02/23/2013 11:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45924.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45924.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Carson","There were no other sightings in Carson on or around February 23rd 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.832996","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-118.273116","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/26/2013 04:11 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.832996,+-118.273116(45924)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45924) map </A>","Summary":"seen 3 lights in a triangle form move through a cloud and dissapear","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Other","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
