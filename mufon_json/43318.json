We reside in Daly City, CA. My son informed me that about 1950hr. on 10-16-2012, he had heard a loud rumbling noise that drew his attention to look out his window. When he looked up, he had seen a blueish white light streaking above residential homes on clear night skies as the rumbling noise increased. He couldn't make out the shape of the object but thought it looked a flat object. After it passed over a few dozen homes, it made an abrupt vertical L shape turn straight up into the clear night skies and disappeared in about 2 secs. at very high speeds and high elevations. Wonder if anyone has seen this and reported this?"],"Region":"California","Date Submitted":"10/17/2012 04:13 UTC","Log Number":"US-10172012-0004"}
