I keep a video recorder in my car all the time and took a video of the object while driving. I was in shock when I looked at the video the other day. As I continued to shoot at the object 3 to 4 more appear in the frame but I never saw them while shooting the video because they were over the roof of my truck. So when I looked at the footage I couldn't believe what I saw. The first object would kind of blip out and then show up again all the while the other 4 stayed in frame and noticeable. Then the one at the bottom of the triangle does the same thing. I have a dark gray plastic dashboard so I have ruled out a reflection."],"Longitude":"-89.392128","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.642885","Region":"Illinois","Date Submitted":"10/25/2010 09:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26111.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26111.html"]}
