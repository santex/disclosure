I thought It was a satellite because it was moving like one in a straight line (east). Then as soon as I noticed it wasn't a star, it got a little brighter and then it slowly started to disappear. I saw it very dim for a few seconds then I couldn't see it anymore..After it was gone I was disappointing cause it left. Could that be a a Phenomenon of a satellite? I looked to see if there was any satellites over California at this time and the direction it was going but didn't find anything"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.038636","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/10/2009 10:20 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"08/10/2009 10:20 UTC"}
