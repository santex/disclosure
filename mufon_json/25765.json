I looked through binoculars and saw a bunch of different color flashing lights but it was very far away. I did not think nothing of it until I noticed that within 20mins it has changed position in the sky radically 3 times by using a tree for refrence. It looks very strange and is just hovering there. I am surprised no planes have flew towards it. I have tried taking pictures however it is too far away."],"Log Number":"US-10092010-0014"}
