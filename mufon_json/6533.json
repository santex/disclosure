Craft came from east northeast moving west southwest toward Wichita. Craft was a ball of creamy yellow light fifteen feet in diameter two thousand feet in altitude. No sound. Slow movement with pauses in speed yet kept moving steadily with slight side movements. Odd: a fixed-wing plane coming from the southeast intersected its flight path. One quarter mile before they met, the light on the craft dimmed slowly. The craft then flew steadily under the airplane as it disappeared into the night sky."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.019212,+-98.475546(6533)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6533) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/01/2007 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.019212"}
