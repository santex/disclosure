It was very bright like airplane landing lights. This location is approx. 10 miles east from Tinker AFB. I noticed it was odd because the light was so bright. As I got closer I saw that it was two lights and did not appear to be moving but I thought that it was likely a plane or helicopter that was just appearing to move slowly. As I got even closer, I saw that there was a third light and a red flashing light in the middle of a black triangle. The lights illuminated the bottom side of the triangle which looked smooth. The object was very stationary and hovering with no sound. It would have been easy to hear if there was a jet or prop engine or a helicopter because I was simply too close. I got a bad feeling and did not stop."],"trends":["There have been 78 other sightings in Oklahoma City","There were no other sightings in Oklahoma City on or around April 18th 2012"]}
