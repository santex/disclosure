{"divs":["Sighting Details In Huntington WV, I went outside with my son at 11 pm to get my cell phone from my car when we noticed a small orange light moving without sound from left to right (North to Northeast) in the sky. A second orange light appeared approximately one minute afterwards. The objects seemed to disappear after we lost sight of them due to tree cover. The sky was cloudless and we had an excellent view of the event."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52004.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52004.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-11032013-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/02/2013 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Two orange dots moving slowly, without sound, left to right.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"52004","Region":"West Virginia","Date Submitted":"11/03/2013 11:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","City":"Huntington","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Huntington","There were no other sightings in Huntington on or around November 2nd 2013"],"Latitude":"38.42322","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.42322,+-82.435654(52004)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52004) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-82.435654"}
