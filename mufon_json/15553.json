{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watching the Super Bowl Pre Game Show on NBC and ther was an interview of Faith Hill and shortly after that there was a shot of the American flag from below and right in the center of the screen there was a opening in the clouds . Well an object came into view at the top of the opening in the clouds right below the flag and it traveled from top to the bottom of the screen at a very high rate of speed. I was recording it and have the recording still and have watched it a few time and I cannot make it out the shape. I know that there was a now fly zone over the stadium at this time so there should not have been any plane traffic in this area. It may have been a plane but it left no con trail which almost all aircraft do leave at the altitude that this craft was traveling. I cannot give you a copy of the recording as it is on my cable box DVR and also there are some copy right issues here that deal with the NFL."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15553.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15553.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.506594","Summary":"During the Super Bowl pre-game show an object shot across the screen at very high speed.","Latitude":"27.670877","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Case Number":"15553","Date Submitted":"02/01/2009 01:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.670877,+-81.506594(15553)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15553) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/01/2009 01:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02172009-0015","Source":"MUFON"}
