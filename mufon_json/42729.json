What made us notice the lights was the fact that I often watch the sky at night when I'm not driving and they just stood out because it was the brightest thing in the sky. They made no noise and didn't seem to be bothered by the cars on the road, though I'm unsure of their exact altitude. We drove under the lights and we lost sight of them being as they didn't seem to move at all. We talked about them for a little bit both agreeing that it was weird, later at home I developed a pretty bad headache, the worst one in a few months that didn't seemed to be eased by medication. Upon talking to my mother today (3 days later) she appeared to have had a fairly bad headache that presisted up until this morning. She described hers as dull and throbby, mine was more of a sharp and stabbing one but it later turned to dull and throbbing. Medication did not help either of us. Frankly I'm still a bit freaked out, but this is the first sighting that I've experienced that has left me with a lasting uncomfortable feeling. My mother and I are no strangers to odd lights in the sky, she has seen a few of them prior to my birth and some after I was born. I've seen them on and off through the years since I was 8 years old. But this is the first sighting that has left me with a headache and a lasting uncomfortable feeling and talking about it also makes me feel very uncomfortable."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.024764,+-80.169268(42729)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42729) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.169268","Case Number":"42729","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42729.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42729.html"],"Latitude":"33.024764","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Summerville","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Odd orange lights over Highway 17A"}
