I thought the object was a Cessna when I first saw it, but I would have heard it at that altitude and it was glowing green, unlike a normal aircraft. The object appeared in a flash of green then moved from 39 degrees above the horizon to about 25 degrees when it disappeared. It had a stripe of green light on it that disappeared and reappeared, so I could tell it was spinning at about 2 rps. I thought it was very strange when I saw it, but pushed it off somewhat because I thought it might have been a n experimental place. I lost sight of the object when it was 25 degrees over the horizon because it disappeared into thin air."]}
