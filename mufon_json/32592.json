There was a larger group of lights followed by a smaller group. They were in a random group not in a pattern. It looked like they were moving moderately across the sky. When we turned a corner and looked up again, they were gone. They were yellow, white round lights. Could they have some kind of weather balloons? We both thought there were too many to be planes."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/14/2011 11:19 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.949929,+-95.22344(32592)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32592) map </A>","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Lawrence","There were no other sightings in Lawrence on or around October 14th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"38.949929","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/14/2011 08:00 UTC","Summary":"About a dozen lights in clusters traveling from north to south in the eastern sky at about 2 o'clock in the sky. when we Saw for about 2 minutes then turned corner, looked, then they were all gone."}
