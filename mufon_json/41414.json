There are two thing I remember vividly about this sighting. This thing moved FAST and it was LOUD. It was so fast I didn't even hear it until it was over my head. It came at me from behind and I saw it just as I looked up to see where this amazingly loud roar came from. It all happened in an instant. It seemed to be only a couple hundred feet in the air. In an instant this thing was a little black slit on the horizon."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.364804","Date Submitted":"08/04/2012 07:10 UTC","City":"Greenville","Latitude":"35.618871","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/15/1989 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-08042012-0015","Case Number":"41414","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Greenville","There were no other sightings in Greenville on or around August 15th 1989"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
