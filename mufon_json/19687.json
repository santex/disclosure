We were both about 12 years old. He noticed a glowing object floating in our neigbors yard. It was about midnite. It moved slowly across the yard at about 5 feet off the ground. He was frightened as hell. I immediately got up and walked towards it. He told me to stay away from it but I was compelled to see it. The light came from behind the neighbors house and floated over the yard and it lit up the side of the house as well as the ground below it. I came with in 30 feet of it. The light was quite brilliant, not a beam like a flashlite. It was shaped like a geodesic dome and looked like highly polished chrome or some type of polished glass or gem. It floated in a straight path and didnt move up or down. As I approached it made a slight pop sound like a bubble popped and disappeared. Ironically we where just a feet from the spot where I saw the blue phosflourescent light in the sky a few years earlier."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.194658,+-84.109975(19687)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19687) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/30/1966 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-84.109975","Summary":"moving glowing light","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19687.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19687.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Chesaning","There were no other sightings in Chesaning on or around June 30th 1966"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"19687","Disposition":"Unknown"}
