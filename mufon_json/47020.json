Both objects stopped dead in its tracks. Hovered for a couple seconds, decended, then rapidly ascended, moved on a straight path to the North. The objects hovered and split into what I counted was 4 smaller objects. The two main objects were stationary while the other 4 were moving with rapid omni-directional patterns. The 4 smaller object reconverged with the 2 objects and the 2 objects merged into one and turned into a bluish-white colored object. The shape of the object was more of an oblong shape but not a complete sphere. The object then rapidly ascended out of view."],"Date Submitted":"04/27/2013 08:30 UTC","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47020.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47020.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-121.77537","Date of the Event":"04/22/2013 02:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Klamath Falls","There were no other sightings in Klamath Falls on or around April 22nd 2013"],"Region":"Oregon","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"47020","Summary":"Early morning observation","Source":"MUFON","City":"Klamath Falls"}
