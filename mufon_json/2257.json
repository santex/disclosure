I noticed these objects by the blinking white lights and red light on back of objects. the front of these objects are completely black. Two were flying east. The first passed over me and continued east, before I saw the second flying east not in the same flight line. The third black triangle I saw flying north by northeast. I saw this third black triangle in the western sky, not far from the object that I described in the previous report. Although I did not see the front, as they have the same speed, size, same back end with the same lights, flying at the same speed as the black triangles that I reported last summer, I insist that these recent sightings are also black triangles."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2257.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2257.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/27/2003 10:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Hoax"}
