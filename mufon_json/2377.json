It was silver in color and hadround marking on it. Then I noticed about 10 or so round black balls trailingthe object. They seemed to be trying to catch up with the object. When theycaught up with the triangle, they made a round circle around the triangle.Thetriangle and the black balls circleing it continued to fly to the north untilthey faded away into the horizon.I was intrested in the black balls as I hadseen just one black ball a couple of years before, which was much closer andlarger and besides changing directions it also hovered, then went straight uptill it was just a pin point then faded away.it was quite a emotional experienceand almost religious feeling."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Fargo","There were no other sightings in Fargo on or around July 4th 2000"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.885406,+-96.788703(2377)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2377) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/04/2000 07:15 UTC","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","Latitude":"46.885406","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-96.788703","Date of the Event":"07/04/2000 07:15 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2377.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2377.html"],"Summary":"Saw Triangle with black balls behind it","Country":"United States","Case Number":"2377","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"North Dakota"}
