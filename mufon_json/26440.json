Possibly square or triangle shaped. I have been traveling down back roads here in southern NJ for several years on the weekends and have never seen as much activity as in the past couple of months let alone this very evening. Tonight was slightly unnerving as they were the lowest flying I've ever seen. I was frustrated to not be able to see them as clearly as I was driving and didnt have to courage to pull over for what would have been my first real close up view. I hope there is an opportunity here. Belguim quality. The area was a drive from Marlton NJ down to Cumberland county most activity tonight was seen along Malaga Rd. Lately this area seems to be a hot spot.I hope that someone from your group thats local takes the time to ride out a couple of nights to see whats really going on out there."],"Date Submitted":"11/08/2010 03:54 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
