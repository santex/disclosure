Seconds later three more followed in triangle formation. Could have been a Helicopters but I haven't seen something like that move in the sky. No noise but we were about a mile away. Could be a million explanations but never seen anything like it. Though I will say I've seen a LOT of military craft in the sky the. Last few days so my guess they were some kind of military craft like helicopters. Though I was drawn to how interesting it is a lot of the moments are very similar to mine the last few days with the orange lights moing in a traight line."],"Log Number":"US-08192012-0002","Date of the Event":"08/19/2012 12:00 UTC"}
