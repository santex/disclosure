I notice because im always looking at that direction at night, im always looking at Jupiter or the moon with my telescope, and i knew those lights or stars weren't suppose to be there. The lights were just flying really slow towards the East, then they started to get dimer i guess they were already to far from our view and just left the scene like a plane leaves and gets smaller when its really far. We were all excited we couldnt take our eyes of them, we all got a gut feeling and knew they weren't from this world, we knew they were something else!"],"Case Number":"45088","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-01082013-0001","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"California","Object Features":"None"}
