{"Case Number":"51678","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","divs":["Sighting Detailswent out to check the mail, saw a star like object just before moonrise. Went back after dusk to dark with bino's. Object flashed, changed colors, changed shapes, and got brighter then dimmer, then brighter and was moving slowly toward the west. Upon binoc's siting, object had a electrical storm, very changing light patterns and lightning. It had it's own flying dark rocks, and changed from a circle to a large flat glowing bar. At times it looked like a fingerprint. Some objects appeared to be entering and exiting or flying around it. A large wedge shaped dark place was flying near, under then past then back by it. I could not see the dark plane in the binoc's. There was a large orange planet following it underneath very slowly. I felt exilerated and amazed at it. It was very cold and I had to go inside"],"Latitude":"39.555701","Log Number":"US-10202013-0016","Summary":"looked like a star at first, gave off quite a light show, and changed shapes, and colors","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cigar, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like, Other","City":"Fearnowville","Date of the Event":"10/17/2013 07:18 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-105.776077","Region":"Colorado","Date Submitted":"10/20/2013 05:47 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.555701,+-105.776077(51678)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51678) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Fearnowville","There was one other sighting in Fearnowville on or around October 17th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51678.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51678.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
