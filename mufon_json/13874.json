Same lights as noted by prev report from Abilene and Eastland (report 13842). The orange lights will appear for a second, then disappear. Saw two sets of two, lined up horizontally, although slightly separated in height. I imagine these lights are probably orange due to atmospheric effects, i.e., dust, smog, between me and them, so they might actually be a white color the closer you are. Somebody PLEASE get a good video camera on a tripod using a night shot and get these things on video. This is crazy - the first time I ever witnessed what I KNEW to be something weird was just last month and now I've seen them two nights in a row? SOMETHING'S HAPPENING people. Saw no obvious military aircraft but did see regular traffic out of DFW heading west."],"Latitude":"32.939252","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/21/2008 06:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Graford","There was one other sighting in Graford on or around November 21st 2008"],"Log Number":"US-11212008-0013","Case Number":"13874","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13874.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13874.html"]}
