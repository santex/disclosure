The area is near (down town Houston) My family and friends gathered together for my sons 10th birthday every one had left except one of my friends and his wife and children. Four of us were outside having a conversation when all of a sudden in the sky three of us saw an enormous and extremely bright light or object appear in the sky out of no where. By the time I told my friend to turn around the object was shooting off very quickly out of sight. I have never personally seen anything like this. This object made no noise and when it shot off it was extremely fast like no plane that I���ve seen . My wife tried to say it was a shooting star but this object was moving upward from my point of reference. My wife is more the skeptical of what she saw and tries to explain it away but my friends wife and I saw it very well, and could not dismiss it as being a shooting star."],"Summary":"Extremely bright light soars by in the near north side Houston sky","Longitude":"-95.3651","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/30/0002 01:30 UTC","Latitude":"29.764963","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12029.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12029.html"],"City":"Houston"}
