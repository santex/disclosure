At first I thought the military was doing an exercise in the evening, but there were no flashing lights like airplanes usually have, and they weren't moving as fast as the military planes do. They were flying in one straight line. I was excited since I never heard of an UFO sightings here on Guam. I lost sight because I had to focus on driving. When I looked up, three had disappeared, and when I got off the car after parking, the last one disappeared."],"Summary":"There were four orange orb like objects flying in one line.
