Hudson Lake, Oklahoma, 3:10 AM. I am an Aircraft Mechanic for a major Airline since 1988. I know what a conventional aircraft looks like. I turned off my alarm and sat up on the edge of the bed, I get up every night, 5 days a week at this hour to go to work. As I looked out the bedroom window I saw a light emerge into view from the right. It was moving from south to north at a very slow speed. If it had been a Cessna 152 aircraft it would have fallen into the lake. It was moving that slow. I then realized I was not looking at an aircraft that I had not seen before. I happened to have a pair of binoculars in the bottom drawer on my night stand. I got them and ran over to the window. There was a half moon that night and no clouds. The craft was about 1000 ft in altitude and about 300 yards from shore of Lake Hudson. When I looked at it through the binoculars it was definitely round and had lights all around the edge of it on the bottom about a foot from the edge. They were all red except at the back where there was one white light. All the red lights would blink off then back on in counter clockwise sequence around the craft. They were spaced about two feet apart. It was definitely a metallic surface because the town lights of Salina Oklahoma were reflecting off the bottom of it. I could not see the top because I was under it. The craft was about 40 feet in diameter. I followed it with the binoculars till it went out of sight behind some trees. I quickly got dressed and ran outside to follow it some more but it had already gone. I watched it for about 3 to 4 minutes."],"Log Number":"US-02202010-0002","City":"Salina","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Salina","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.292869,+-95.153297(21946)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21946) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21946.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21946.html"],"Case Number":"21946","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-95.153297","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
