{"Case Number":"23253","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my lunch break lying down on my back on warm place on the wall near the building where I work. I was actually trying to get some sleep but it wasn't happening. I was wide awake and staring up at the sky. This wall is on the northeast side of a pair of buildings in downtown LA. It moved quite smoothly and quietly above the building. It was a round object that was dark grey almost black. It looked like a loose balllon but it was moving forward like a plane. It actually looked like a bowling ball. At one point the side of the object appeared to depress or indent like there was pressure being put on it. As it passed by a smaill light appeared on the tail which got brighter as it passed. When this light was the most bright the object disappeared extremely rapidly. It was just gone. I still don't believe it but I'm sure I saw what I saw."],"Summary":"Short passby moving n-s that moved without any noise.","Longitude":"-118.236285","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"04/29/2010 11:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-05132010-0001","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around April 29th 2010"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"34.057554","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/13/2010 12:32 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Los Angeles","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23253.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23253.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.057554,+-118.236285(23253)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23253) map </A>"}
