As I approached the turn in the highway, I noticed a plane flying from east to west, perpendicular to the highway, and the valley. I thought, how strange for a plane to be flying that direction. I was a helicopter pilot in the Army, and a very sane, conservative, normal guy. I was teaching school and coaching at the time of this event, so there was nothing unusual about my life at the time. The next thing I noticed was that this plane was flying too low, very low by aviation standards, and I thought why is the plane flying so low? Next, I noticed that the plane was large, not just a small private plane. I pulled over, off the side of the road, just around the curve in the highway, and got out of my pickup. I stood by my pickup and gawked at this plane, which was still to the east of me, but was now getting near. I was amazed that other cars passing by apparently did not see what I was seeing, and that they didn���t stop. As I watched this plane approach, I now realized that not only was it very large, but it also made no sound, and was flying too slow to stay up. I���m a pilot and I know the air speed necessary to keep a plane in the air and have a feel for when a plane is at or near the ���stall��� speed. This plane was flying too slow. In addition, this plane was kind of transparent, and it had lights on it. I could see no people, but this plane flew at probably no more than 500 feet above the ground, at a speed too slow to sustain flight, made no sound, and flew on directly west until it was out of sight. I stood in awe of what I had just witnessed. What was that? Why was it flying here? Why so low? Why did I see it? What in the world was it?"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Moapa Valley","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Wings","Region":"Nevada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15667.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15667.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown"}
