again i was 'in limbo' concerning what i'd just seen. some minutes later, and a third one 'materialized' just above me, like the other two, travelling at the same speed (tremendous), altitude and trajectory. before it disappeared from sight, i thought 'why don't you make a turn, so i'll know you're not a satelite?' and at that very moment, it made a turn (to the west)!!! then it was out of sight. then a cessna plane or something of that kind came flying low over me, followed by a fourth ufo, same as the ones before. but before this one vanished over the horizon, a passenger airplane came along. their trajectories crossed, and now it was plain to see that the ufo was flying much higher, and much much faster than the passenger airplane. btw, the ufos were white dots, very small, yet very visible, but only for those looking intently up at the sky at the very place where they were flying. i would say they were circular, but that's hard to tell at such distance. they were, or seemed at any rate, very solid, white things, with no discernible shape. again, the ufo disappeared, and again the doubt came sneeking up on me. and then came another, and then another, until the doubt seemed more like vanity than anything scientifically substantial. all in all, i saw ten such ufos in the span of half an hour. i never saw two at the same time, but at one time a new one appeared immediately after the last one disappeared over the horizon, so i guess it must have been at least two, but probably ten, unless the same ufo flew over me until out of sight, and then teleported back to just above me, doing this ten times. one of the ufos had more of a west\\east trajectory, the others more or less in a straight north\\south trajectory. after the ufos had passed, i noticed a small cloud, of the cummulus kind, with lots of creases and shapes, the type of cloud you see faces and stuff in, moving towards me from the south-east towards north-west. i was baffled by the speed at which it 'unfolded'; in a minute or two it had tripled or quadrupled it's size. it looked, visually that is, far more astonishing than the ufos. as it had dramatically increased it's size, it turned into a uniform foggy patch in a matter of seconds. it went from being your average type of cartoon-cummulus to an elongated circular patch of uniform 'fog' in probably no more than two minutes, expanding it's area by probably 600-1000% in that time span. the transformation happened just above me, where i'd seen the ufos 'materialize' earlier, but at much lower altitude, maybe a fifth of the altitude of the ufos, although that is only a guesstimation. i believe i've answered point 1-3 above. 4: white dots, most probably circular. moved in straight trajectories from north to south at very high speeds, took maybe 10 seconds to cross the sky. one ufo made a turn towards the west, one ufo had a west-east trajectory. uniform speed, many times greater than an average passenger airplane. 5: calm, observing and accepting during observation, followed by disbelief, this was repeated ten times until it was no longer followed by disbelief. it seemed ordinary in a strange way. 6: i loosed sight of the objects as they moved closer to the horizon, where they disappeared in the more white light towards the horizon. i would say they disappeared from sight due to the angle through the atmosphere i was seeing them; as they got closer to the horizon they were obscured by the increasing amount of air\\humidity\\pollution through which i saw them. i did not have a camera with me, and i would have needed some really expensive gear for the pictures to have been interesting at any rate, due to the speed and altitude at which they were flying."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/20/2011 07:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Rioja","Longitude":"-2.449995","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Spain","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Logroño","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"30295","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30295.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30295.html"]}
