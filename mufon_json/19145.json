I happened to look up and see two lights moving across the sky. At first I thought two satellites were moving across the night sky. But for starters, they were too low to be satellites. The lights were bright, while the front light was a little dimmer then the second. They moved in a straight line, at the same speed across the sky. They did not blink or twinkle or make any noise of any kind. They moved relatively slowly across the viewable night sky. The total view time was around 4-5 minutes. My little sister ran outside with her camera and tried to record the event after my buddy's cell phone failed to pick up the lights on camera. You can barely see the lights and its hard to tell what they are so i doubt it can be used as proof. Eventually they lights moved behind the trees and disappeared."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.94913","Latitude":"37.840346","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Kentucky","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09082009-0018","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Radcliff","There were no other sightings in Radcliff on or around September 8th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON"}
