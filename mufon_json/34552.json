In one of that pics, taken to my father, with my cell phone, when I saw it in my laptop screen, saw a black point in the left up side of the pic, above a mount called Tetacahui. I made a zoom to this point and it's strange, because has not a form I could recognize. In the right side of the pic, besides another mount, there's a bird and it's a clear form, but that point looks like a black point even when it apperas to be closer than the birf. I'm sendin the pic for your analysis. I don't believe in UFO's, but I don't know what that point is. Hope you have an answer to it.
