There were always 3 to 5 of them and it went on for 6 months. One night we decided to try and follow them, we drove about 30 to 40 miles south and suddenly there was a Hugh flash from the sky and seemed to of landed beside our car, of course we hauled assed and did not stick around to find out what it was. The light still appeared a few nights a week and we still sat on the porch watching them but we never chased them again. So maybe it has always been a sign of the times, of the world ending as we know it or maybe they have just always been over Hico, Stephenville, Fairy, Dublin. Hamilton ect. Sit and watch one night and see if they are still there!!!
