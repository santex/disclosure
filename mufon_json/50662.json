At that time i didn���t noticed the UFO hovering around the halo. You can actually see another one at the start in the top corner. 3 years later i found this out when bored and was watching my videos, i watched it like 10 times and found even more movements, it was crazy. I took 1 video and 3 images just because of the cloudy halo. I was amazed when i found this out. It was hovering around, up and down, diagonal, side to side. Sadly, when i was filming this i didn���t noticed it so the video only lasts 31 seconds."],"Date of the Event":"11/03/2010 04:28 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.514947,+-117.038247(50662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50662) map </A>","Case Number":"50662","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
