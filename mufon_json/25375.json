{"Longitude":"-112.002279","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy children and I were watching the meteor shower between 8 and 9 pm MST, then noticed a very distant object that looked like a distant star, it was moving at a steady pace. We watched it for about 10 minutes moving across the sky on a slightly curved path, seemed like a very long distance. Before we couldn't see it anymore it seemed to be dimming a little, like it was getting further away. Then my son said it had a gold or amber glow around it for a second, that's when we saw it shoot off into the distance and couldn't see it anymore. It was so far away there was no way I could have video taped it (not that I even thought about until after), the sky was clear and filled with stars, it seemed to just blend in, except it was moving. There really isn't much more I can say about it, other than I am happy it kept it's distance."],"Region":"Arizona","Date Submitted":"09/11/2010 07:32 UTC","Latitude":"34.746218","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Cottonwood","There were no other sightings in Cottonwood on or around September 10th 2010"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09112010-0004","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.746218,+-112.002279(25375)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25375) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25375.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25375.html"],"Summary":"Distant star-like moving across western sky during Perseid Meteor Shower","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","City":"Cottonwood","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"09/10/2010 08:45 UTC","Case Number":"25375"}
