Over the Blue Mountains (mountains themselves obstructed by neighboring houses (I live I a mobile home park), I seen the object flying horizontal to the ground from my right to left at about 20 degrees up. At first I thought it might have been a white bird (such as a seagull) but when it moved into the clouds (from the clouds, I realizing afterwards), I knew that birds do not fly that high. It was about the size of a grain of white rice held at arms distance. I was certain that is was not an airplane, balloon, bird, etc. It did not make any sound. I documented (to myself) ���activity��� in the same region of the sky before on 1-22-11 but is was more like a stationary ���tear drop��� that suddenly appeared and vanished as quickly (about 8-seconds visible) but, perhaps, I should file that as a separate report. I believe that ���something��� is ���going on��� in that particular area of the sky. This is my second UFO sighting (the other being the 1-22-11 sighting) and the first time I have reported such a sighting to any organization."],"Log Number":"US-03052011-0015","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","City":"Walla Walla","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.072581,+-118.340771(28111)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28111) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
