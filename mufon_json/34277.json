I witnessed a bright red round object in the sky at about 7:45PM Eastern Time. The object was moving pretty slowly - even stopping at times - and then faded away. There were no strobe lights that are normally associated with aircrafts. It looked like it was a planet or a star at first; I realized it wasn't when I saw it moving. Did anyone else see something similar?"],"Summary":"Star/planet-like object seen in the nigh sky.
