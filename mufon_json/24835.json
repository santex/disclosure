I was stopping along the way to take pictures of the scenery. I noticed what I thought was a spot on a picture of the mountain after enlarging it back home in California. I zoomed in on it and decided to share it. I also sent in two pictures previously of images from near Skykomish. To get three pictures in two weeks in the same general area?...I decided to check all the pictures closely. These three were of interest. I had no intention of photographing UFO's. I was only there to photograph scenery. At the time I took these pictures I noticed and heard nothing out of the ordinary. The camera used was a Canon PowerShot A560 with 7.1 Mega Pixels."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Noticed image on picture from Mount Rainier on Road to Sunrise Lodge.","Date Submitted":"07/29/2010 03:05 UTC","Region":"Washington","City":"Packwood","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Packwood","There were no other sightings in Packwood on or around July 15th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24835.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24835_submitter_file1__IMG_1135.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24835.html"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/15/2010 11:53 UTC","Log Number":"US-07292010-0017","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.606501,+-121.670644(24835)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24835) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
