The total alotment of time that elapased between the time offirst sight and the time that the object shot into the sky was about 5 minutes.At the first sight the boys thougt it was a helacopter,however only secondslater realised it was something quite differrent since it was fairly lowflying,made absolutly no noise or sound what so ever and gave off the brightlight.
