{"Region":"Texas","divs":["Sighting DetailsWent to bed around 1030 P.M. and I couldnt go to sleep so I stayed up watching The Simpsons and all the sudden I heard some Huming sound from outside in my front yard, so I looked out my window and saw this Disk shaped object just hovering across the street then hover near my house. All the sudden my T.V. started acting weird and my phone and I-Pod shut off. Couldnt get them back on until the next morning. I did get a drawing of it though, as I went outside in my back yard, I saw the object just hovering over my house, red lights circling around the craft, and about twenty windows. Watched it for about twenty minutes and it just hovered off like it took Hyperspace."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40798.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40798.html"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"07/13/2012 11:25 UTC","Sighting Duration":"11:25:10","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"{flg} UFO Hovered over my hourse at around midnight for about 20 minutes then pass.","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"Cedar Park","Case Number":"40798","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.524767,+-97.820782(40798)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40798) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/14/2012 07:09 UTC","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Cedar Park","There was one other sighting in Cedar Park on or around July 13th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07142012-0020","Latitude":"30.524767","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-97.820782"}
