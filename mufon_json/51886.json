{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were out in garden smoking a cig, when i noticed a bright object coming from NW, it was gliding like the speed of an airliner had small sideways motions L-R yet keeping path. There were no sound, no blinking light as an airliner, but extreme bright at least twice or more than Jupiter. I ran to get my Camcorder but i could not pick it up on cam, but i could see street lamp with it. seemed to as if the light were of other frequency that Cam could not pick up. in steady speed it vanished in the direction SE. Time of observation 7.55EST 20mi west of Indianapolis. My first thought were it was plane, but it became very clear it was not, there were 2 airliners in flight both headed NE, one very high the other fairly low, those wing blinkers were so clear but none on this one. altitude approx 1000feet, no sound at all just gliding over Sky. NE to SE."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"51886","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.451422","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.630214,+-86.451422(51886)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51886) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Appeared as very big bright Star 2x Jupiter","Log Number":"US-10272013-0019","Latitude":"39.630214","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/27/2013 07:55 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/27/2013 08:18 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Diamond, Saturn-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Clayton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51886.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51886.html"],"City":"Clayton","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
