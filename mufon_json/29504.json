{"Region":"Michigan","divs":["sighting detailsfor the last three nights in a row i have seen multiple slow moving objects. 3-4 red lights in triangle type shape but would rotate and sometimes another bright orange or blue light would be visible for a second. i saw it twice in may (around may 21st) and again the last three night....last nights sighting was more clear and longer then the previous couple sightings, the thing moved very slowly across the sky then would do some super fast sprial moves, lights would kinda flash and it would hover, and disappear at times. i chased it from the backyard to the front yard last night around 10\\11pm and after a minute lost it in the trees as it was heading east.... the first time i thought i had to be something else, as i had never seen anything like it before, completely silent, at first just looks like a star moving slowly across the sky, then you assume its an airplane but when the altitude does not change and it starts to do corkscrews that theory is out the window...."],"trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Lansing","There was one other sighting in Lansing on or around June 11th 2011"],"City":"Lansing","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"3rd Night in a row red lights slow moving silent","Date of the Event":"06/11/2011 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/12/2011 10:28 UTC","Latitude":"42.733845","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29504.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29504.html"],"Case Number":"29504","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-84.547315","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.733845,+-84.547315(29504)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29504) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06122011-0006"}
