{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Connecticut","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving southbound on the Wilbur Cross Parkway near Orange, CT and observed a stationary object high in the sky that appeared to be metallic and reflecting light. It was over the treeline of the northbound lane and I lost sight of it for about 30 seconds but witnessed it again where the treeline was shorter. I was about 3 to 4 miles from the Sikorsky bridge so I figured when I arrived there I could view it better however it was no longer in the sky. There were a few cirrus clouds and it was near sunset but there were some behind the object My first impression was that it was a star but then when I caught other glimpses and it appeared to be reflecting light rather than creating it. The altitude of the object appeared to be 15-20,000 feet and it seemed to be over the Stratford side of the Wepawaug River opposite Sikorsky. I could not take a picture because I was driving."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Orange","There were no other sightings in Orange on or around August 19th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-73.026528","Latitude":"41.278637","Summary":"Hovering metallic craft reflected sunlight","City":"Orange","Log Number":"US-08192012-0023","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/19/2012 10:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.278637,+-73.026528(41876)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41876) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"41876","Date of the Event":"08/19/2012 07:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41876.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41876.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere"}
