I stopped in the nearby park to have a smoke before bed, gathering my thoughts. I walked my bike across the street to my apartment building and saw two of my neighbors coming home when I realized they were staring in the sky. I saw multiple searchlights circulating from the ground up towards a red glowing aircraft. It was stationary for about thirty seconds, glowing to a brighter red orange color. I stood peacefully and content, then I decided to make random waving and winking gestures to which a flash returned my way from the craft. It slowly hovered laterally towards the south until it diminished into the clouds. I went into my building to the roof to see if I could spot it again. I only saw the searchlights from the ground in different places, circulating. After that, I went to bed happy, excited, and looking forward to my next experience."],"Summary":"Saw a glowing red, hovering aircraft over San Francisco.
