{"divs":["sighting detailsme and a friend of mine were sitting in the hot tub and i just so happened to look up in the northwest direction and noticed a bright white light moving slowly overhead. it was moving from northwest to southeast and there was no sound. i immediately joked to my friend and said \"look at that ufo.\" my friend said no it was just an airplane. but as it moved closer overhead we noticed that there were no red or green blinking lights like normal aircraft have. as it flew further away from us it started to fade away (first the white light went out and you could see a small dim red light which did not blink) and finally it vanished. we knew then that it couldn���t be any one of our aircrafts or anything that we could explain. later we saw two aircraft with red and green blinking lights and my friend explained that this unidentified light did not have these then it had to be something other than any type of aircraft that we know about. we also thought it might be the international space station but it seemed to be moving to slow. plus after it passed over us, the light just vanished. it was about the size of 1\\4 of your thumb nail with your arm held out straight."],"City":"Fort Worth","Log Number":"US-06092008-0008","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were 2 other sightings in Fort Worth on or around June 8th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"06/08/2008 10:10 UTC","Longitude":"-97.3158","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"11106","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.733009,+-97.3158(11106)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11106) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11106.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11106.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/08/2008 10:10 UTC","Summary":"Bright white light moving from northwest to southeast over wise county","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"32.733009"}
