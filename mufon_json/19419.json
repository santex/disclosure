{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were having dinner at Norwalk Yacht Club in Norwalk CT. A bright light in the sky caught my attention and I looked out from under the umbrella thinking that it was the moon. There was a very bright light with a large oval area of light around us. Almost as though someone were shining a bright flood light on us from up in the sky. There was no noise of a plane, helicopter or anything else. After about 20 seconds to one minute the bright center light disapeared and there was just the oval light. 30 seconds later that disapeared too and the sky was left to its crystal clear, stary night. About 10 people saw this, and all were amazed. I would love to know what I saw."],"Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"It looked like a very bright flood light shining down on us from far away. Bright light at center with bulb lighting around it. Quickly fading.","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Norwalk","There were no other sightings in Norwalk on or around September 19th 2009"],"City":"Norwalk","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 09:16 UTC","Case Number":"19419","Object Features":"Dome","Region":"Connecticut","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19419.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19419.html"],"Longitude":"-73.405497","Log Number":"US-09192009-0036","Latitude":"41.119277","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.119277,+-73.405497(19419)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19419) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 08:05 UTC"}
