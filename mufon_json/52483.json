The dog started whimpering and wanted to come back in the house. So I sat with him on the porch and waited for him to calm down. He was looking into the sky. It was then I noticed 6 lights flying across the sky. They were a yellowish orange color. They moved fast and were silent. They moved in a straight line going east. They were far apart from each other and traveled at the same ratecof speed. I stared at the first one til it wad out of sight. I ran in the housecto get my boyfriend. He came out only to see the last 3 travel off into the distance. He couldnt explain it either. We both agreed those could not have been planes. They just seemed to move too fast and they were dead quiet."],"Summary":"6 yellow orange lights in a row moving fast across the sky. no sound.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Beecher","Longitude":"-87.652847"}
