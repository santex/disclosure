We usually stargaze a bit and talk, specifically looking for UFOs and other anomalies in the sky. As I was just about to turn in for the night, before walking through the door to go inside, I notice a strange orange, non-blinking light and call my brother out. We follow it for 10 minutes. It was traveling a constant speed. At one moment (which would be what made it an awesome sighting for me), it passes over the moon at which point my brother and I could see its silhouette! It looked like an elongated pod with 3 thrusters at the bottom. Shortly after it passes over the moon, the light goes dim and it just disappears."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","City":"Huntington Beach"}
