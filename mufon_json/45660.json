But, as if flew over it just seemed more like a high altitude rocket. We could see flames shooting out the back of it. The object and the flames were both orange and bright. And, it moved in a straight path from north to south. It seemed pretty high in the sky, but much slower than meteors I've seen. We are both just trying to see how many people saw it. And, we'd love to know what it was."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.79708","Longitude":"-78.776677","Tags":"City","Region":"North Carolina","Date Submitted":"02/10/2013 11:22 UTC","City":"Cary","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/09/2013 08:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45660.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45660.html"],"Summary":"Orange teardrop shaped object with flames seen moving slowly over night sky","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.79708,+-78.776677(45660)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45660) map </A>","Case Number":"45660"}
