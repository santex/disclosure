First saw them as I came onto the highway from HWY 26 on the west side of 41. I saw these lights before, and from the overpass they were very visible. I thought it was the B-17 from the EAA grounds the first time I saw the lights. Now I think they are flares, but acnnot explain why I could not hear the jets. First I saw one single orange light, it faded out after about 2 seconds and a srting of 3 came on, followed by another string of 3, then they went out one at a time in reverse order as they came on. After stopping, I saw several more single and double lights over the lake Butte Des Morts are and south or west of Oshkosh. I stopped across the bridge at the 76 exit truck stop. I had my HD camera but I could not get naything to show up despite how bright they were."]}
