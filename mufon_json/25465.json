I noticed the object while taking out the garbage,it was just s-se of me traveling in the same direction.O'hare is east of my location.I lost sight of the object as it cleared the roof of my house."],"Longitude":"-87.978956","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/13/2010 07:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25465.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25465.html"],"Summary":"Light moving nw-se.","Log Number":"US-09162010-0013","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.963362","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wood Dale","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"25465"}
