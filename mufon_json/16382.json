However, this was not to be. On Saturday (March 28, 2009) at 1:30 PM while sitting in the parking lot of the Old Navy Store near the intersection of LA Hwy 14 and I-210 in Lake Charles, Louisiana; I observed what first appeared to be a small white aircraft approximately 3,000-4,000 high about a mile to the North traveling West. The small white craft traveled at a speed comparable to a prop plane and did not seem that unusual as it could pass as a normal airplane flying in the distance (although the craft appeared somewhat flat). The craft also did not seem out of place as the old Chennault Air Base was located a couple of miles to the East (the direction that the craft came from). However, being UFO sensitized (or paranoid) I continued to observe the flight of the craft for several minutes. As the craft continued it���s Westward movement, it must have banked somewhat as it soon gave the profile of a perfect white letter ���V��� in the totally clear blue sky. This started getting my attention, but still I assumed that perhaps I was watching a aircraft such as a white Lear Jet with swept back wings. I also assumed that perhaps I could not see the fuselage of the craft due to the distance of the craft or the angle of it���s flight, although I could not understand why not. After watching the flying white ���V��� fly West about one minute, I observed the craft go point up and fly almost straight up vertical about another 1,000 feet. At this point, I was fairly convinced that the slow moving aircraft had to be a jet to make this maneuver, even though it���s speed matched the speed of a prop plane. At this point I started digging in the center console of my pickup trying to locate my digital camera while keeping both eyes on the craft just in case this thing did anything else unusual or came close enough for a picture. The point of the flying white ���V ��� never did turn in my direction, but appeared to be pointed North after it made it���s climb. The next thing I notice is the ���V��� flying backwards toward the South (with the point of the ���V��� pointed North). This really got my attention as the craft flew about half a mile West of me headed South at approximately 5,000 feet. At this point, the backward flying white ���V��� appeared to have one leg of the ���V��� approximately four times as wide as the other leg. (However, this may have only appeared so due to the angle of the craft in the sky). Fanatically trying to rip my camera bag open without success, I finally looked down to find the zipper on the camera bag and removed the camera. When I looked back up, I could no longer see the backward flying white ���V���."],"Case Number":"16382","Date of the Event":"03/28/2009 01:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Lake Charles","Longitude":"-93.210296","Log Number":"US-04022009-0015","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.229855,+-93.210296(16382)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16382) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"White backward flying \"V\" shaped craft.","Date Submitted":"03/28/2009 01:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Louisiana","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
