{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was bringing my grandmother to work around 5:50AM in the morning like i do every day,but this day was special, while i was driving i noticed a very bright light in the sky, bouncing and moving back and forth, i knew this was not a helicoptor, or plane. After dropping my GM off, i drove quickly back to the site to see if it was still there and it was, so i parked my car for about 5 min watching and waiting. i turned my lights off cause at the time i figured they could see me watching. I watched it bounce all the way down the street and the it came back,shortly after a real plain came passing by, very smooth and slow,wings, and windows very visible to me, the ufo was about 50 feet above the plain, i dont know how they did not see this event, after the plain passed it the bounced in the air, down the street and back , after realizing what i seen i quickly went home and told my parents"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.844167,+-72.741389(14524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14524) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"I watch a very bright light hover in the air, moving up & down, left & right, shortly after I seen a real plane, and it went by very visibly.","City":"Bloomfield","Latitude":"41.844167","Date Submitted":"08/26/2008 06:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-12252008-0003","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bloomfield","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Connecticut","Case Number":"14524","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14524.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/26/2008 06:00 UTC","Object Features":"Dome","Longitude":"-72.741389"}
