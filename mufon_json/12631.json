{"Region":"California","Latitude":"34.10244","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","City":"Upland","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Summary":"Star-like lights associated with a lenticular or cigar shaped object in night sky over Los Angeles","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were driving west on Interstate 210 in Upland, CA coming up to Mountain Avenue to return to our motel room. She was on the passenger side and happened to glance upward through the side window and said ���What���s that in the sky?��� I immediately looked through the front windshield and noticed what she was referring to. Whatever it was, it was quite strange and did not fit the description of an airliner, helicopter, blimp or stationary light in the sky. This sighting was very brief and did not afford us much opportunity to check it out carefully, but seemed strange enough to report as a UFO, since I could not ascertain the object to be anything I had ever seen before. This object was moving very slowly in our direction at about a 20 degree angle from directly overhead. Since I was driving on the interstate I could not take much time in analyzing what it was, but I managed three quick glances as we approached a turn at the exist to Mountain Avenue. Mount Baldy was off to the right of us in the distance, and this object was between the mountain and the interstate. We both agreed that the object had 4 star-like white lights and one red light out front. When she said that the object had stopped moving, I immediately ruled out an airliner. I happened to focus on the object more clearly as I came to a stop at the exit to Mountain Avenue I noticed the object (or objects) included a lenticular or cigar shaped gray area in the middle of the light configuration seemingly disassociated from it above and below the fuselage area. A strange structuring of detail on the apparent surface included many dark spots against a gray background that formed the lenticular cigar shape of the craft ��� very strange. My wife said later that it seemed to be a kind of mystical arrangement at the time of the sighting. We talked about our sighting many times since last Saturday, but were not able to conclude it was anything we had ever seen before. We saw a helicopter moving south of the sighting, and clearly could tell the difference between a normal helicopter and what we saw in the sky. Conclusion: A true unknown object (UFO), since we could not identify it to be any known object. Speculation: A possible sighting of an advanced government project from Area 51 in Nevada (using anti-gravity technology) or an extraterrestrial craft visiting the Los Angeles area. If anyone else has seen this object or something similar, please report it and especially do so if this sighting can be ruled out of being a secret government project or an extraterrestrial craft.
