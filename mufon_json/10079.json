At approximately 10:20PM ET I was walking my dog when I looked out to the eastern sky. I noticed an aircraft heading southwest at an extreme height when I observed four unusual looking craft coming east flying low without any noise. The craft had at least 1 red light on the top in addition to flashing and static lights were not following any of the normal flight patterns. As they came east the then swerved north and started to fly away. I immediately returned to my house, 8 feet, and went up stairs to mention the sightinhg to my wife. I then looked out of the bathroom window andd called my wife to come to the window as the craft had circled around and were flying some what in a circle. Again there was no noise. I then called to my son who also came to the window and thought that they appeared unusual. They gave the appearance of flying like helicopters with their quick movements but without the noise. We thought that they might have been searching for somthing but they didn't use any searchlights. After about 15 minutes they then flew off in a northwest direction. Several minutes after they flew away we observed and heard several aircraft fly north usung the usual flight patterns."],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Triangle","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10079.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10079.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10079.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around March 28th 2008"],"City":"Philadelphia","Log Number":"US-03282008-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.959795,+-75.156589(10079)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10079) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
