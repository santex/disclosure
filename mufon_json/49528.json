{"Region":"England","Latitude":"52.928639","divs":["Sighting Detailswalking the dog at dusk, noticed in the sky directly in front of me a very bright object. The stars were not yet visible as the night sky was still dusky, not pitch black. There were no flashing lights of a plane, but there was a plane in the sky in the northern area. What alerted me was how bright the light was, it was larger than a star but not as large as the sun. It moved very fast and erratically up and down and backwards and forwards in a pattern I have never seen a plane or helicopter do. I immediately thought what is this? I grabbed my phone to video it but it dissapeared without a trace. I spoke to someone else the next day to tell them of this and they too saw this light, but in a different location perhaps more northerly. They described exactly the same manoueveres."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"08/06/2013 07:12 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"very bright light, during dusk, no stars out yet, no flashing but erratic movement","City":"Stapleford","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49528.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49528.html"],"Case Number":"49528","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/05/2013 09:05 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United Kingdom","Log Number":"GB-08062013-0011","Longitude":"-1.272719","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Stapleford","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.928639,+-1.272719(49528)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49528) map </A>"}
