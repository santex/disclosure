{"City":"Marfa","divs":["Sighting DetailsBoth my wife and I saw the ufo as we were driving to see my wife's family in Chihuahua, Mexico. As we approached Marfa, we saw it hovering for over 15 minutes in broad daylight. We stopped in Marfa and took 2 pics. In one you can see the ufo (once you zoom in) the other you can't tell anything. Once in Marfa we turned toward Presidio and we couldn't see it anymore because it was now behind us."],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.316038,+-104.009182(28484)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28484) map </A>","Summary":"Cigar-shape ufo in Marfa, TX","Date Submitted":"03/31/2011 09:02 UTC","Latitude":"30.316038","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-03312011-0006","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar","Date of the Event":"03/12/2011 07:35 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Marfa","There were no other sightings in Marfa on or around March 12th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28484.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28484.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-104.009182","Case Number":"28484"}
