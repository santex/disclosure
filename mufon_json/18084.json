At about 10:35 I looked up straight to the north. I then seen 2 lights and about 3 seconds later a third appeared. At first I thought the lights were three helicopters or a very low airplane but they made no noise and seemed to be close enough where I should have heard them. I looked closer and the lights were actually 3 groups of 2 lights in each group. They were very close to each other and were an equal distance apart. The light on the far left then disappeared and then reappeared on the far right of the other two. This same pattern repeated two times and lasted a period of about 45 seconds. The light on the left then disappeared, and then the next one, and then the last one disappeared and they did not reappear again. There was no noise at all and the lights only moved a very short distance to the west. I was in disbelief of what I had seen."],"Log Number":"US-07142009-0018","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-82.817433","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Peck","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.258636,+-82.817433(18084)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18084) map </A>","Summary":"Saw 3 lights equal distance apart that disapeared and reapeared on the oposite side of the other 2","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Case Number":"18084","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/08/2009 10:35 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/08/2009 10:35 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
