We were enjoying the nice weather and looking up at the stars. If you look at the first picture, imagine the three of us facing away from the house & looking toward the field. As we had our heads tilted slightly toward the sky to stargaze a bizarre object came into view from behind. Naturally, we tilted our heads back further & further to get a better view of what was above us. A smooth, silver, disc-shaped object that was approximately 4 times the size of my grandparents house was slowly moving over our heads. It was only about 20 feet above the house (which is 2-story) and made absolutely no sound at all. The three of us were in complete awe of this magnificent sight. The craft was so smooth that it appeared to be made of an almost fluid-like metal. Completely lining the edge all the way around the disc were the most beautiful white lights. It was a shade of white that I have never seen in my entire life, and to this day I still can not explain the incredible luminescence of the lights. As bright as the lights were, one would expect to be temporarily blinded, but we didn���t need to shield our eyes at all. The craft hovered silently over us and slowly made it���s way across the street. Once it reached the field that you see in the second picture it stopped completely and just sat for a moment. All of a sudden the large ship shot straight into the air with lightning speed and separated into three pieces going in three different directions. For nearly 15 years after that (until my next and subsequent encounters) I had never experienced anything in my life that allowed me to feel so at peace... so complete... so safe... so loved. There wasn���t a single part of me that was scared that night, as many people imagine they would be in a situation like that. I suppose it���s just something that nobody could ever truly fathom unless they experience for themself."],"Log Number":"US-03042009-0014","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Stafford","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"07/17/1992 09:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"Silver, disc-shaped UFO with lights all around edge.","Latitude":"29.616067","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15839.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15839_submitter_file1__GrandmasHouse.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15839_submitter_file2__FieldacrossfromGrandmasHouse.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15839.html"],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Stafford","There were no other sightings in Stafford on or around July 17th 1992","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
