At first i believed them to be helicopters, but a helicopter could not replicate the rapid changes in direction these objects made. I kept my eyes on them, and they were swooping around each other, almost like a dance, getting close then moving back out, always smoothly but rapidly. We turned off of Marine Drive continuing to our destination and I lost sight of the objects."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"45.58961","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-122.592121","Summary":"3 spheres swooping around each other over Portland International Airport","Region":"Oregon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37133.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37133.html"],"City":"Portland","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.58961,+-122.592121(37133)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37133) map </A>","Case Number":"37133","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"03/01/2012 07:00 UTC","Tags":"City"}
