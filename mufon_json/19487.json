The bright object appeared to be round but when seen through the binoculars looked triangular. It was 20 times larger than any star or planet we have ever seen in the sky. We could not determine the distance but seemed very far away. It seemed to be stationery. After a couple of minutes, from our vantage point, a smaller light separated downward from the larger object with a trail of light visible between the two objects for a brief time. During the separation, both objects seemed brighter. After the light diminished between the two objects, they both disappeared toward the northeast."],"Latitude":"35.087641","trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were 3 other sightings in Albuquerque on or around September 20th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"09/20/2009 01:08 UTC","Log Number":"US-09202009-0027","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.087641,+-106.647677(19487)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19487) map </A>","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
