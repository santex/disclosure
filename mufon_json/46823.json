I like to watch stars at night from time to time and I happened to notice the one zip upward and to the right. I was at home with my bf. 2. I noticed it was the only starlike object flickering brightly than the rest. 3. I thought the object was a star or aircraft. 4. It made fluent zips and dashes with purpose to the left and right then would hover for a few seconds then go in circular motions clockwise and counter clockwise. 5. I was creeped out at first I have never seen anything make such movements before then the more I watched I became more intrigued and couldn't take my eyes off it. 6. I never lost sight it's still hovering as I write this."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/17/2013 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-04172013-0013","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Star-like","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Madbury","There were no other sightings in Madbury on or around April 17th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.16917","Longitude":"-70.92444","City":"Madbury","Date Submitted":"04/17/2013 10:28 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46823.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46823.html"],"Summary":"Small starlike hovering light with rapid circular motions sometimes zipping left to right or clockwise/counterclockwise","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.16917,+-70.92444(46823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46823) map </A>"}
