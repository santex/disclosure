I looked up and seen 1 object that looked like a shinny ball. I told was about to tell my kids to look up at what i though might be a satellite. Just as I was about to say that I noticed 2 more just behind it and then I noticed the sun reflecting off of crescent shaped wings on them. I told the kids to look at them. Then one of the 2 trailing objects made a sharp left and went around the other trailing object to its right rear area. They continued south then accelerated at different speeds and faded behind some clouds to the south."]}
