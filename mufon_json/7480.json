{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend Derek and I were driving out in the country because we were bored. Willie was in the back seat but he tells us he could not see anything. We had been driving for about an hour and were talking to each other. The streak appeared shortly after we had turned around to head back. It came from behind the car and moved very quickly. We were going about 60. It was pretty high up and far away I think. It was green. It disappeared after about two seconds. I couldn't make out the shape but I could tell it was moving pretty fast. When I saw it my mouth hung open and I was kinda in awe. I felt like the moment had slowed down a bit. There was a silence between me and Derek for a few seconds. After that it was all we could talk about till we got home. Willie didn't see anything he says."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07202007-0004","Object Shape":"Flash","Longitude":"-93.734189","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in St Bonifacius","There were no other sightings in St Bonifacius on or around July 19th 2007"],"Case Number":"7480","Latitude":"44.906194","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Green streak that came from behind our car and disappeared overhead.","Region":"Minnesota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7480.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7480.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/19/2007 03:27 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/19/2007 03:27 UTC","City":"St Bonifacius","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.906194,+-93.734189(7480)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7480) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02"}
