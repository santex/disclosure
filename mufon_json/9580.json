There two bright, bright white lights about the size of a street light if you were a block away from one, slowly discending from the sky. They were coming from the south heading north. One was slower than the other. One eventually blinked out to where we couldn't see it any more. The other continued to discend then leveled out and continued making a turn then straight again. We watched it for about 5-10 minutes when the light blinked very dull then it went behind a cloud. My mother called for me to bring the binoculars to her house. Three of them were watching it too. Approximately 8:45 pm Down at the lake a large glow. moving fast from west to east if I have my directions right. It was a bit smaller or further away than the earlier ones but was bright white as well. My youngest son saw one around the same time at a different location heading north-west."],"Region":"British Columbia","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Date Submitted":"02/10/2008 06:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Granisle","There were no other sightings in Granisle on or around February 10th 2008"],"Case Number":"9580"}
