{"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Trumbull","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Connecticut","Latitude":"41.249654","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile waiting for the a red light to change, I observed a commercial plane flying in my direction. Suddenly there was also another object above it. The object above was shaped as triangle and had three light on each end. My estimate is that the triangular object was about a mile or more above the plane since I could clearly observe each one. The object must have been large since it appeared bigger than the plane. It had solid light and no beacons on it. The plane as well as the object appeared to be traveling at the same speed. When the light changed to green, I accelerated and pulled into a nearby gas station. At that time I lost track of the plane and objects due to the trees around the gas station."],"Log Number":"US-08082009-0014","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18544","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18544.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18544.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.249654,+-73.194289(18544)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18544) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Triangular shaped object flying above commercial plane","Longitude":"-73.194289","Date of the Event":"08/08/2009 09:05 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/08/2009 09:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Trumbull","There were no other sightings in Trumbull on or around August 8th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
