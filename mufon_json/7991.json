{"Date of the Event":"09/23/2007 10:20 UTC","Longitude":"-81.6075","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at home on my balcony with my buddy Glenn. I just happened to look up and notice some strange moving lights just above the tree tops at some distance away. At first we thought it was a helicopter because they fly alot on our base. The object remained far away for a few minutes just kind of moving up and down. Then it flew closer and we could see lights that appeared to revolve or shift around the object. that's when we noticed it wasn't a helicopter. My initial reaction was sheer terror. We ran downstairs and I grabbed my phone and ran back outside with Glenn behind me. By then the object was very close. It was sort of hovering over the house across the street. Once we made it to the driveway it seemed to dissapear."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09242007-0008","Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"Hoax","Case Number":"7991","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7991.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7991_submitter_file1__413541688_5e6c20e75d_o.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7991.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Georgia","Summary":"one light on each corner flashing intermittently.","Date Submitted":"09/23/2007 10:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.88,+-81.6075(7991)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7991) map </A>","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Fort Stewart","There were no other sightings in Fort Stewart on or around September 23rd 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Fort Stewart","Latitude":"31.88"}
