I noticed the object immediately. It was larger than an aircraftwould have been and was just floating in the sky. It was cylinder shaped withlights that appeared to be whirring around it. The lights were white with someblue and pink in them. I considered I was possibly seeing an airplane at somestrange angle, but observed several aircraft flying over Denver at the time andthis was very different. The lights were more luminous larger and brighter thanother aircraft I observed. The object was silent, and started to move in onedirection only, and that was straight down. When I first saw it, it was about40 degrees above eye level, then it floated straight down like it was going toland. I lost sight of it behind some trees and couldnt see if it landed ornot. The sighting lasted 1-2 min. I was trying so hard to observe it, I didnttry to get another witness. I lost sight of it too fast and there was no time."],"Longitude":"-104.968056","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.544444,+-104.968056(1652)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1652) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Saw lighted object drop straight down from the sky","Date Submitted":"04/16/2002 09:45 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/16/2002 09:45 UTC","City":"Highlands Ranch","Region":"Colorado","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Highlands Ranch","There were no other sightings in Highlands Ranch on or around April 16th 2002"]}
