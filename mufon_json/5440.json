I had no special reason to be looking up except that I often just look at that time of night to see when stars begin to appear. The object was semi-oval in shape, lighted neon greenish-blue and slightly flat looking across the rear of it. It moved extremely fast with no sound going overhead from west to east. I did not know what the object could be and only thought of it as something strange and unidentifiable. It went in a straight line and was much faster than a plane. It winked out in a part of the sky that did not have clouds in it that it could have been obscured by and although I kept watching for a couple of minutes, it did not reappear and I did not see anything else or hear anything at all in the area."],"trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Sparks","There were no other sightings in Sparks on or around September 21st 2006"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Lighted object silently flew across sky","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5440.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5440.html"],"Region":"Nevada","Latitude":"39.534911","Longitude":"-119.752689","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
