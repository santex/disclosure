As I watched them the \"lead\" object stopped and the other 2 continued their path. As they passed the stationary object they appeared to be flying at an extremely fast rate of speed. The stationary object remained in place until I looked away, when I looked back up I couldn't see it anymore. They were very hard to see to begin with due to their altitude. There was no noise, no contrail, no lights. As I stood there and observed them they seemed to resemble balloons."]}
