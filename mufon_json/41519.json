{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy dad and I was relaxing after a long day of fin on the sun. We are on vacation Maui. We were at the baconey of our hot room when we notice 3 bright red orange lights. At first we assumed they were airplanes but they were close together and on in straight line. Then we thought maybe they were paper lantern but the lights were solid and never blink if it was a lantern. The 3 objects got bigger and clearer. I ran to get my phone and started to record. I realized that I didn't hit record. So I pressed it. By then the lights where not as clear and the phone couldnt zoom in. They all disappeared at some exact spot."],"Region":"Hawaii","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41519.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41519.html"],"Case Number":"41519","Latitude":"19.901536","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.901536,+-155.575812(41519)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41519) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/05/2012 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/07/2012 02:03 UTC","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Longitude":"-155.575812","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-08072012-0021","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"3 Bright light lantern","Object Features":"Unknown"}
