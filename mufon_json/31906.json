HE SAID THAT THE ORBS WOULD MOVE IN A FAST PACE TO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. HE STATES THAT THE ORBS WOULD DESCENT INTO THE CLOUDS, AND WOULD ASCENT BACK DOWN. I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM FREAKED OUT SO BAD, WHEN HE CAME HOME HE WOKE ME UP AND WAS VERY STARTLED, BUT WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED. SO WE WENT OUTSIDE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY ACTIVITY GOING ON, AND THAT'S WHEN I WITNESSED A RUMBLING, ALMOST THUNDER LIKE SOUND. IT WAS STRANGE IT SOUNDED AS IF THERE WAS A HUGE SPACESHIP RIGHT ON TOP OF US, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THE HUMAN EYE COULD SEE. THERE WAS A RECENT SIGHTING A MONTH AGO, I GUESS WERE NOT ALONE! OH, AND HE STATES THAT SOME OF THE ORBS HAD A WING LIKE FEATURE TO THEM...COULD THEY BE ANGELS? WELL TO MY OPINION, AT THAT HOUR I WOULD THINK THAT THE ANGELS ARE FIGHTING THE DEMONS...OH WELL?
