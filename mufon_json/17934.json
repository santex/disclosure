This was low enough i just happened to see this looking through the windshield. When i first glanced, I thought it was a plane, but I know better, I worked at an airport years ago, I've never seen an orange, golden yellow, glowing airplane, sitting in the sky. This was not very high in the air, it was not low, but too low to be an aircraft. It did not move, it just emitted a very bright glow. It was just bright and big. I was just stunned and thought it was strange. I also questioned is it a tower? All of the towers in our area blink red. This was much bigger than a tower light and it just glowed. When I looked up again it was gone. I only looked away for maybe one or two seconds. This was a solid glowing ball. That was last night. My husband, who gets off work at 10:00p called me on his way home tonight and told me he saw a big orangish yellow ball in the sky. He was driving south coming home and saw this thing. When he got home we drove all around town looking up to see if we could see this again, but we didn't. I have no idea what this was, and neither does he , but I think it is strange that we both saw this. I would like to know if anybody else saw this too. We live in a small town so maybe i'll find out."],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.21062,+-91.827563(17934)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17934) map </A>","Summary":"large fireball/globe","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"17934","Longitude":"-91.827563","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/06/2009 03:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17934.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17934.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States"}
