They were moving in patterns around eachother sort of like when you are mixing cups around on the table with a ball onder one of them.. Kind of a figure eight pattern with three orbs. They would also move and then stop and hover for a while in other patterns. This lasted for only a few minutes and then they faded away. They did not fly off... they just dimmed out and were gone. I had a couple people with me when I saw this, but at this time none of us had a camera."],"Date of the Event":"09/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/17/2012 02:19 UTC"}
