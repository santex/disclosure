(it was kind of like the \"trail\" a sparkler leaves when quickly run across your field of vision, but thin, like a laser is thin.) i also would mention, that during the 2-3 minutes of this observation, there were aircraft approaching the nearby portland international airport and in holding patters with external lights and landing lights on. this object was clearly not an approaching nor a landing aircraft. and, i have also watched head-on-approaching, landing approach, landing-lights-on, aircraft, many times, and this object was not one of those. and, also during the time this object was visible, there was an intercontinental jet at cruise altitude directly above us, and this object was certainly not one of those either. there were no visible lights (or anything similar to aircraft lights) on this aircraft. in addition to me, my friend saw the object in the sky (i summoned him from inside the restaurant), however, he did not see the actual \"disappearance\" occur, but did confirm he didn't see it after i watched it \"blink out\". i swear this report is accurate and true."],"Latitude":"45.644918","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05232009-0004","Region":"Washington","City":"Vancouver","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00"}
