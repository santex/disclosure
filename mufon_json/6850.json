I went out to my back garden and looked up and saw something that I can only describe as a UFO. It was quite high up, not moving, but it glowed a blueish tint every few seconds. I went back inside to get some binoculars and I could see that the object was a disc, and it was spinning as well. It still didnt move and as I watched it, it moved slowly from right to left, glowing slighly brighter as it went. No noise came from the object, and the sky was clear enough for me to watch it as it went all the over the trees behind my house. It stopped, glowed bright white, and then it was just gone. It vanished. Has anyone else seen these discs? I was shocked to see it, and I didn't really realize wot it was until it was gone. The whole thing lasted about 10minutes."]}
