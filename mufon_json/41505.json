I looked outside and saw a blinking orb in the sky. I stared at it thinking it was a plane or something. I stared at it for 10 minutes but it wasn't going anywhere. It would move a little bit, but never went out of sight. It shot out a bright light from it and I knew it wasn't normal. It then started disappear and reappear in a different spot. I was really scared because I kept seeing things outside my window. It effected my sleeping from fear. Please have somebody come out to Stockbridge, MA and investigate the sky at night. I saw it today and again 2 days ago. I did not get to video tape it due to it being very dark and the quality of my camera isn't very good."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.320386","Date Submitted":"08/07/2012 02:02 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Stockbridge","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
