I saw a pulsating light to the n.e. moving so slow that it took atleast half hour to travel a distance that a helicopter could have done in under a minute. After I initially seen the object I took my dogs in Android got my wife. At this time I retrieved my telescope. I set it up and proceeded to watch the object. When looking through the telescope I could see what appeared to be a circular object with red, green, blue and yellow lights pulsating and changing colors in no particular pattern that I could tell. After 30 minutes or so it slowly left my view in a westward direction. Once this happend I preceeded inside, when I turned around and seen another identical object to the n.e. I also watched this object for about half Android hour. It was headed east but had a slight angle heading upward as it moved. Watched this object until trees blocked my view."],"Date Submitted":"06/30/2011 04:07 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oklahoma","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Tulsa","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.991405","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06302011-0014","Summary":"Circular craft of unknown size, pulsating red, green, blue, & yellow, slowly moved across sky.","Latitude":"36.161982","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.161982,+-95.991405(29805)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29805) map </A>","Case Number":"29805","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29805.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29805.html"]}
