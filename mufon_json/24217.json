While I was looking I noticed Two Orange star-like objects just over the horizon toward the North west. The objects seem to twinkle like a star, but more intense. The objects seem to fly about the speed of a plane, but there were no like beacons. My first thought was that they were rockets.... As the objects moved across the sky, they split and one seemed to go straight up and slowly faded away, the other continued on its course across the sky. The hole thing lasted less than a couple of minutes. They were definatly not fireworks. They were high in the sky and flew at about the speed of a plane."],"Log Number":"US-07052010-0067","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.620081,+-116.205786(24217)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24217) map </A>","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-116.205786","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 04:27 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.620081","Region":"Idaho","trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There were 2 other sightings in Boise on or around July 4th 2010"]}
