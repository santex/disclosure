I am moving horizontally with cold air moving by me fast. Then I spiral upward. I am in a very bright room. I see a group of grey creatures with small bodies from the neck down. They have big eyes and big heads with a small chin. Then I float like I am walking on air to the operating table. Two of them are on the right.side and one on the left. There is also one in the backround. They have tiny implements and they stare at me. After that, all I can remember is going downward in a spiral, then horizontally with cool air passing me. During the incident I felt as though I was light and airy and compelled to let things flow. The beings did not turn their heads. When they turned, they would move their torso and head in one motion. I thought I was in a foreign place. I was scared on the operating table. After the incident I felt physically numb and emotionally cold."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.744455,+-74.052435(51728)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51728) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10222013-0003","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Dome","Latitude":"40.744455","Region":"New Jersey","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-74.052435","Date of the Event":"12/11/1966 02:09 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/22/2013 12:48 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval, Saturn-like","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Jersey City","There were no other sightings in Jersey City on or around December 11th 1966"],"City":"Jersey City"}
