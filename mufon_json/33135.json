I was driving down 61st street in Tulsa between Sheridan and Yale. I looked up and was amazed to see a rainbow cloud that was glowing and beautiful. It was not a rainbow just part of the cloud. I told my son to look up and he saw it also. We were both looking at the cloud and saw a silver illuminated sphere floating upwards beside the cloud! The sphere was lit up then continued to get dull grey then just simply vanished and the rainbow light vanished also! This lasted for a couple of minutes. Right after the object disappeared a jet flew by. We saw something really special, my heart is racing and I feel so excited. I was driving so there was no time to snap a picture it all happened so fast."],"Latitude":"36.155042","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.155042,+-95.991175(33135)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33135) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/04/2011 05:51 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33135.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33135.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/04/2011 04:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 59 other sightings in Tulsa","There were no other sightings in Tulsa on or around November 4th 2011"],"Summary":"Experience was amazing!
