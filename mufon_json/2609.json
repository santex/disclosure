My daughter is an astronomy buff so she waswatching the sky. She said look at the strange plane. I looked and a light inthe sky was traveling VERY fast from the north. it was soon joined by two otherlights. one from the SW and one from the NE as they flew over our area theyjoined together into one object and flew out towards the atlantic. Normally iwould not have thought about writing but they moved so fast. they cleared ourview from north to SE in just about 6 or 7 seconds and then when they lookedlike they became one object my daughter insisted i tell someone."],"Log Number":"","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Summary":"Three Glowing Lights Form into One Big Light","Case Number":"2609","Date Submitted":"10/15/2003 10:50 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.817496","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/15/2003 10:50 UTC","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in North Myrtle Beach","There were no other sightings in North Myrtle Beach on or around October 15th 2003"],"Longitude":"-78.674206","Region":"South Carolina","City":"North Myrtle Beach","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Windy","Object Shape":"Oval","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.817496,+-78.674206(2609)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2609) map </A>"}
