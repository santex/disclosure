They were closer together than the stars inOrions sword and about as bright, but a little larger. The fuzziness could havebeen due to the somewhat humid conditions. Although moving east3E west at a very high speed and, what appeared to be a very high altitude, theywere criss-crossing each other in a figure 8 fashion. They moved from directlyoverhead to about 70 degrees above the horizon in about 3-4 seconds. At thatpoint, they disappeared behind a hazy cloud. My wife, always skeptical aboutUFOs is not so skeptical any more I am a computer professional in a local schooldistrict and Rob is a history teacher in a middle school. My wife was employedas a teachertechnician in an elementary Media Center at the time."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Unknown","Log Number":""}
