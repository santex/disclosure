Nobody was there because it was at night, but there was a lot of moonlight and I could see plenty well enough to skate. I took my boots off and put on my new skates. After skating around for a few minutes, I noticed a light in the sky that didn't quite fit in with the rest of the lights in the sky. I stopped skating and looked directly at it, trying do get an ID. It was stationary at first and then it appeared to come directly towards me for about a half a second. Then it stopped and hoovered. I could not figure out what it might be. Then it started it's manovers. It would excellerate half way across the sky, then stop abrubtly. Then it seemed to drop down and swoop up like a bird landing on a branch. Then it would streek acros the sky and change directions without loosing it's incredible speed. After about 30 seconds of this, I got very scared and ran home. In fact, I was so scared I forgot to take my new skates off and grab my boots. I ran a block on concrete sidewalks and damaged my skate blades. My mom was ferious about the skates and did not believe I got scared of a light. I did not bring up the subject again. I was a student of avaiation and I knew it was not a helecopter, blimp, ballon, satellite, rocket, missle, aircraft, fireworks or anything I could dream up."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.714184,+-98.003889(31814)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31814) map </A>","Longitude":"-98.003889","Tags":"City"}
