I was playing around with my digital camera and took a picture of the moon. At the time I did not notice anything in the sky. Just the other day I was looking over my pictures to see which ones I should delete to make room on my hard drive. I came to this picture, I zoomed in and noticed the objects in the air. I'm not sure what it is, but I thought I would send it to your office. You have more experience with these types of things. I will send the original picture I took."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Hungary","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/23/2005 10:59 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Orfű","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.13829,+18.15574(4393)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4393) map </A>","Longitude":"18.15574","Region":"Baranya","Case Number":"4393","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","City":"OrfÃÂ±","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"46.13829","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"HU-02072006-0002","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Saturn-like"}
