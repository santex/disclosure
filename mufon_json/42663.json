Last night, right before I went to bed at 4:50am. (I know, I stayed up really late.) I saw a freaking UFO!!! I always believed in Aliens and such but one always has that slight doubt in the back of there head because you your self have yet to see anything solid. But there it was!!!! First I thought it was just a star. (I leave my windows open so the breeze comes in. Plus I like looking at the stars as I lie in bed.) But then it caught my eye. It started to move...then it got closer and I could make out strobing multicolored lights then the shape. Then it stopped moving but the lights where always strobing across it. Then it started to move in a really strange pattern. Some times really slow...then impossibly fast! At first I thought it might be a trick of the eye or something but then it went behind a palm tree then came back out. So then I had a point of reference to the thing. I started to feel a little scared because it was something so strange and my mind kept trying to explain to me what I was seeing...but ya...it was a UFO!!!!!! It stayed around for a good few hours tell I just was to tired to keep watching and accidentally fell asleep while watching it. Here I drew what it looked like and the shape of it's very strange flight pattern."],"Longitude":"-117.347004","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Log Number":"US-09192012-0013","Case Number":"42663"}
