Ever since then I been trying to make sense of what I witnesed, and I have all kinds of questions but no one to ask. I,m not saying that this was a UFO, because there's no way to confirm that, the object was too far away and too quick, to make a positive ID. My question is: is it possible to see a meteor during the day and should it be silver, could of been a satellite, or even space junk? Please reply to my e-mail address, maybe I could get an answer to this.
