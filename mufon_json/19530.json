The color was orange and flared in intensity, and the shape was that of ball, except when the colors flashed (or varied in intensity), where in the shape expanded, but still remained ball shaped. We were sitting at a house on Chicago Street in Elgin, IL at dusk smoking cigarettes and cigars chatting about our day when I expressed that I was unable to identify the object and indicated to the other people where I was looking. Nothing specifically caused me to look for the object, but as a person who regularly watches planes overhead, I often find myself looking up. Rowan was the first to come off the porch and immediately expressed to Lily to retrieve his camera, next off the porch was Bethany and our other friend. They stepped down off the porch to see what I was looking at and we all expressed that none of us could identify the light as any kind of aircraft that we recognized. We continued to watch the object as it moved in both lateral and vertical movements that were not indicative of aircraft or hot air balloons. The sky was light enough to see well, but the light of the object did not allow us to see any structure. The sun was below the horizon on the far side of the object from us and there was no light source that would have cause reflection against an object in the sky. There was no sound. Distance was hard to identify, but the object likely moved towards us and then receded as the size changed from smaller, to larger and then smaller again as it appeared to move away. Speed also was not able to be estimated as the object was only visible for about 2 and a half minutes before it was gone from view. However comparing it to standard known aircraft it took about half the time a normal aircraft does to recede from view. There were no other aircraft visible at the time of this sighting. Lily returned with the camera, and Rowan attempted to photograph the object. With his 12 mega-pixel camera two shots recorded the image, one showed a ball approximately 10 pixels across, the other which was shot with at a slowed down speed, showed some shaking and ghosting from the shooter, but also showed a distinct light trail. After the object was no longer visible we talked about it and the fact that it qualified as a real UFO as non of us were able to identify it. We were all glad that there were multiple people there to witness it."],"Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Orange ball of light with intensity variations","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Elgin","There were no other sightings in Elgin on or around September 19th 2009"],"Latitude":"42.041849","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Case Number":"19530","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Elgin","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.041849,+-88.27273(19530)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19530) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 07:52 UTC"}
