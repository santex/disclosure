I thought he was just being stupid and joking until I came outside and saw them myself, except there were only 2. They just kind of hovered in the sky and made a little triangular motions; moving left to right then upwards every now and then. They were there for maybe 5 minutes or a little less. And then each of them took off towards East and West directions. They were too fast to be any kind of human aircraft we know of. My brother-in-law lives about 2 miles down the road and my husband was talking to him while they were still there and he said that they were moving towards his direction, and saw them when they left. He said they might've been military aircraft, but there was NO noise to them at all. That's what we all couldn't understand. And with the fact that they were so fast made us question whether or not they were UFOs."],"Weather Factors":"Windy, Does Not Apply","Latitude":"41.366994","Longitude":"-85.058858","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Indiana","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"28608","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like, Unknown","Log Number":"US-04102011-0007","Date Submitted":"04/10/2011 08:53 UTC","City":"Auburn","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.366994,+-85.058858(28608)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28608) map </A>"}
