One of the adults said look. When I looked up I observed a brightly glowing yellow orange oblong object moving extremely fast across the horizon with absolutely no associated noise. We all agreed that nothing we knew of could fly that fast. No flashing lights were observed as you would expect with an airplane. When it was past our vision on the deck we all raced to the other side of the house and observed it make a sweeping turn and then it was out of our vision blocked by homes and trees and the horizon. The object moved from the north west to the east before making the sweeping turn to the south east. The only unusual thing that happened around this time was a forest fire had started the day before in the area and when we first saw the object it was coming from the direction of the fire. I thought it moved like satellite's I have seen before, but this was much closer and it was early dusk much to light to see a satellite."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.872079,+-120.157578(48796)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48796) map </A>","Longitude":"-120.157578","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Glowingbrightly yellow orange, oblong, silent very fast changed course","Date of the Event":"07/05/2013 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
