It was after 11 pm but before midnight. I looked up to see what I thought was a very large beautiful full moon in the west. I made a mental note that I should go outside on my upstairs deck later before I went to bed to enjoy its beauty again. When I glanced back up a few seconds later, it had totally disappeared! I was astonished, but figured at the time the clouds must have moved in very quickly. When I came inside, the image of what I had seen (still assuming it was the full moon) was so vivid that I wrote in my almanac that the July 15 full moon was perfectly centered in my viewing field in the west that evening. The next night, I noticed that not only was the \"real\" moon not completely full but it was still in the south in the sky that time of night! I am somewhat troubled in retrospect...also interesting is the fact that I had felt I needed to make note of it."],"Log Number":"US-07212013-0027","Summary":"looked like the full moon","Longitude":"-94.67609","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.739193,+-94.67609(49107)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49107) map </A>","Case Number":"49107","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49107.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49107.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere"}
