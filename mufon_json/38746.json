There were 5 lights to begin with, then a bunch of lights (as many as 15) all at one time started to appear. I ran inside and got my camera and snapped a few shots. One photo we can count about 12 lights. I ran upstairs and got the video camera and by the time I got to the upstairs deck they started \"burning out\" or fading away. They were in the Southwest sky traveling East and upwards. This is the usual direction for planes on approach to Las Vegas from LA or Burbank. These were not planes because we've never seen that many and we can track the planes across the sky. These lights were going at an angle to the south or upwards. There were also way too many for airlines to be that close together. It made for a interesting night."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"several lights (15) or more traveling from SW nnn","Case Number":"38746","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"06/01/2012 10:45 UTC","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.80852,+-116.416919(38746)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38746) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Nevada","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"06/02/2012 04:39 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06022012-0013","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
