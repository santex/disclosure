The skies were clear and we walked together and talked until we arrived to the gym's door area. As I was going to say good bye before my work out I looked up in the sky. I saw immediately many lights at least 5 or 6 moving fast and chasing each other. They were not flying in a straight line and they were not airplanes. I pointed them to my fiance who happens to be an airline pilot and he also saw them. He said, \"they must be satellites\". I said they can't be satellites, there are too many and they are moving in irregular patterns. After no more than 15 seconds all of the lights vanished. I looked and try to spot them elsewehere in the sky but I didn't see anything else like it. We did see seconds later 2 planes flying from different directions and altitudes but definitely not related nor similar to the lights we saw previously."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Aventura","There were no other sightings in Aventura on or around March 5th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/05/2012 11:20 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/05/2012 08:15 UTC","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"36274","Summary":"Strange moving lights in the sky of Miami","Log Number":"US-03052012-0020","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36274.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36274.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.919929,+-80.154837(36274)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36274) map </A>","Latitude":"25.919929","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","City":"Aventura"}
