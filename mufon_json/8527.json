'jesus christ did you see that?' suddenly the tape i had put in began playing. and we decided to go home. i have since served almost 5 years in a career that deals with aircraft of all kinds. i've seen them all at night, during the day, during twilight hours. most of the time i see them from afar approaching the runway. i have never seen anything like what i saw that night. the experience is something that i have been able to remember in great detail just because it was so awesome."],"Country":"United States"}
