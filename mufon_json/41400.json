{"Summary":"I saw a bright orange ball of light going from north to south during the fireworks dispaly. It went out of site and circled around using the same path. It was quiet and slow.","City":"Monroe Charter Township","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watching a fireworks display at my mom and dads house when I glanced over and saw a glowing orange orb flickering and flashing in a very perculuar way. It passed in front of us going from the north to the south. It flew out of site through the trees and back around again on the same path going slowly and emitting no noise. We noticed that our neighbors were pointing and talking about it too. We noticed it among the fire works because of its slow movement. My family and I were amazed, my father was on an aircraft carrier for several years and he has knowledge of US aircraft and even he could not place it. Then we tried to be quiet to hear it but there was no sound. The fireworks were not continual so there were moments of silence during this time. The neighborhood we were in is on Lake Erie. The orb seemed to come from the lake area. Quite frankly I was a little frightened. I am not a believer of UFO's but there is simply no explanation for what we saw and didn't hear."],"Date Submitted":"08/04/2012 12:03 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.328487","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Monroe Charter Township","There were no other sightings in Monroe Charter Township on or around July 3rd 2012"],"Latitude":"41.9322","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08042012-0001","Date of the Event":"07/03/2012 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.9322,+-83.328487(41400)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41400) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"41400","Country":"United States","Region":"Michigan","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41400.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41400.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41400.html"]}
