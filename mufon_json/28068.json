Driving around the back of the store to go through the \"drive thru\". Looked up and saw object to the east moving north to South at a decent clip. Being in the car and the angle we could not get a picture with our cell phones. We kept looking for evidence that it was a plane and that with the angle of the sun the wings and tail fins were not eveident. As it passed we realised there were not any wings or tail finsand that it was longer than a plane. It was close enough to see it decently. It moved on to the south. Not a usual flight pattern but not unheard of for planes. But as we looked it did not have wings or tail fins.Currently i do not wish to be contacted by third parties, but couls change this status if need be. There was no sound, we had the windows of the car open."],"City":"Louisville","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Cigar","Tags":"City"}
