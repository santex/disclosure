It was very clearly seen. When we first saw it, we knew it was a UFO. It quickly moved, all of a sudden, in the speed of a blinking eye. We were all scared, and I have seen a UFO when I was a child. It suddenly vanished with no trail or trace of where it went. Later on, about 10 minutes afterward, a friend, who lives 5 miles northwest of us, told us that he saw it over his house."]}
