to their condo in florida with sisters for a vacation between beginning and mid february 1988 , i flew down from paris where i was studying to look after their nice villa as many burglaries were taking place at that time in the region. the house is a 3000 sq ft villa with five bedrooms and bathrooms , nestled hillside on some rolling hills with a great view on the med from a distance.closest neighbours are about 150 meters away on either side as primarily these part of the city consists of large estates.one private road brings to our house (this is some years back , 21 years ago).with a huge sheperd dog that would bark at any noise we were well aware of any person walking in the vicinity on the steet some fifity meters lower. a friend came over i hadn t seeen for a while as had moved up to paris for studies six months before.it was about 6 pm on february 15 or 16 th 1988.we chat a while , had a few sodas and finally started cooking a meal which we ate , went to the local video store to view some movies that night.i recall those films being comedies as we liked to have a good laugh. the house was a one story villa built hillside so living quraters were on first floor , except for an independent efficiency room and bathroom on bottom level.rest of ground level is a three car garage and storage place with an communicating little storage room with the boiler and heating system in there (house had a fuel central heating system).garden was a steep hill with many olive trees and umbrella pine trees very common on the med coast of france.house was surrounded by terrasses , a walkway around the back of the house and a swimming pool at te opposite end. after we view the films , we decide to go to bed , my room was next to the friends room.our dog was outside as usual.this was about midnight. i fall asleep and am waken up by bonnie , the pyrenean sheperd just howling and barking as never before.a big dog of about 100 pounds very gentle but known not to mess around with from strangers. as i wake up going to the window to see what was going on , as i open the steel shutters , i hear my friend yell and scream with terror.he was woken himself by the barking and as he opened his eyes , saw two red eyes glowing in the dark from outside.the shutters were closed , however even made of steel they had regular local style shapes with spaces between them like a french window , and one of them was broken at a height of approximaely two meters. the dog stops howling and makes actually no more noise.growls evey now and then.from the garage downstairs we both hear a door banging as if someone had been opening it with force then just slamming it a few times in a row. i take a 22 lr handy in this case of spooky happenings , thinking a burglar team is on the loose around the house and targeting my parents villa , open the bullet proof door (5mm steel covered it entirely and frame was reinforced and built in within the wall with huge steel rods every foot), a very secure home.i just got afraid for bonnie thinking these guys could have hurt her , so we decide to go outside , then all lights on (possible from inside at the entry with switches for all the exterior lights). feeling secure with the weapon , we don t find any trace of anything and even less the dog.she must have run away.but that dog could defeat some very large dogs and had seen it in the past so we wondered what kind of thing could scare the dog.after verifying nothing was around the house on a check tour , we decide to go and see what was causing such tremendous noise in the locked basement\\garage. the door to the boiler room was definitely closed.nothing to be seen. we go back upu , tuen every light on in the house , and come to speak of the recent events.the corsican buddy was a tall six foot two courageous person , and i was all muscle and six feet , both of us practised karate at a higher level , and though hate to admit it , we had been in a couple of bar fights as young men full of testosterone do when they are teenagers.this corsican guy was strong and never backed away on those occasion. here , he seemed terrified as what he d seen was absolutely beyond his comprehension.two red glowing eyes at two meters high and he stated he d recall this thing seemed to see him in the totally dark room and see \"through him\" as in inside his mind. the dog finally comes back.two hours had passed it was about 2 or 2:30 am in the night.we thought of calling the police but they d certainly just do the same we did and make a statement and file it as usual with no real efficiency against the robbers that had ben storming the city for a few weeks. as we are talking , we hear like a converstaion between two invisible people in the living room we were in , but as if through a closed door , noise seemed attenuated. soon after the door started banging again in the garage and as we went down , nothing , plainly nothing , door is shut , not a noise , noone to be seen.the dog did growl in the garage as we went down there again. she had her tail between her legs since her return from wherever she had been hiding. three last events happened that night: 1 door banged again every now and then with an impression of the entire villa shaking or vibrating to a point i thought there was an earhquake. i verified the following morning and nothing of the sort took place around the french rivierathat night . 2 before going back to bed i was in the bathroom and had a sip of water before going to sleep (if i could !!!) and had a clear vision of my step dad and sisiter at the airport in paris, some kind of clairvoyance .the following morning they called around 10 am to let me know they had both decided to come home earlier than planned for whatever reason and without letting me know or calling me from florida to let me know so could pic them up.this came as a surpsride and has never happened again. 3 as i lay in bed , i feel like someone blowing on my face which scared the hell out of me.i idn t sleep at all if i remember correctly.moreover the corsican buddy had felt the same blow on his face before going to sleep. he never came back to sleep at that place ever again.and i did pick sister and step dad up at airport the following afternoon but never had an explanation on any kind on what this strange night was about or what could have caused it. i do recall another detail is that electrical power did blow and had to go to entry of property to reset the central electrical switch where electricity of france , the supplier had by law installed their disrupters."],"Log Number":"FR-01162009-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/15/1988 01:00
