At first thought it wasplanks flying plane but the object had no marker light just bright white and no sound. It immediately changed direction and speed and headed up and out of the atmosphere becoming smaller and glowing like a satellite until it disappeared within my view straight up out of the atmosphere. I immediately knew it performed impossible maneuvers and speeds for anything man made. Was also witnessed by a friend standing right next to me, neither one of us knew we were both looking at it in the moment. The object went from very close to out of the atmosphere and to far away to see within seconds."],"Longitude":"-90.378452","Case Number":"42778","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Missouri","Date of the Event":"09/23/2012 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Imperial","There were no other sightings in Imperial on or around September 23rd 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Imperial","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.369776","Log Number":"US-09242012-0003","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42778.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42778.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.369776,+-90.378452(42778)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42778) map </A>"}
