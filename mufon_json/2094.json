I had a camcorderwith me and I was watching it go through these changes and it was repeatingitself after a couple of seconds as if by rythum, I zoomed in as best I couldwithout distorting the object and I kept it as still as possible. I got somegreat footage. I dont know what this is, it might be something simple orsomething extrordinary. We were all calm when I first saw this and mentioned itto everybody, but I was the only one with a camcorder. It just hovered there inone spot didnt make any sounds but as far as judging distance it was more than amile away, I cant be exactly sure. we watched for about ten minutes then we hadto leave and that was the last I saw of it. Id like for someone if yourinterested to check this out and let me know what this thing was."],"Longitude":"-114.89901","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2094.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2094.html"]}
