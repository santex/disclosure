What caught my eye was three things- first it was larger by about 10 % of a plane and two- no landing lights and three it was moving slightly slower than a plane. I followed it moving from right to left for about ten seconds when I defintely noticed a shrinkage in size to half its size but not a dimming of its brightness and then it started fading to a dull star and then disappeared. The moon was to my direct right during the sighting and on the same longitude as the object. I can only guess that perhaps the light of the moon may have hit a satellite for a few seconds and that is what i observed.There was no cloud cover for the object to go behind unless it was high altitude. I was facing east south east if i had to guess and only looked at phone watch after a minute."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Longitude":"-73.683758","Latitude":"41.414547","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
