While I was walking him out to his truck at around 10:30 p.m., a faint light moving across the sky caught my eye. I pointed at it so that he could also see. We both observed as it moved silently in a straight path in a southwest direction. It appeared to be a triangle shape with very faint light orbs omitting from three points. We lost sight of it as it disappeared over the house. My father is a retired Navy navigator and pilot of his own single engine airplane. He and I both reported immediatly to the others inside the house. This was the first unidentified object sighting for both of us. Being natural skeptics, this has each of us wondering and confused about the event we witnessed."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.557014,+-117.205223(32862)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32862) map </A>","Summary":"Faint lights in a triangle shape moving across the sky caught my eye.
