I had thought is was some firework being shot off from that area although I hadn't seen any other fireworks during the fireworks display. That's most likely the reason it caught my attention in the first place. It seemed to be descending, then it seemed to move parallel to the deck (ground). It appeared to come out from nowhere and it disappeared into thin air, like it did when it appeared. I didn't say anything about it at the time, but upon reviewing the video clips of the fireworks I was surprise to have actually captured it for a brief moment when it disappeared."],"Log Number":"US-07092013-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48827.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48827.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/09/2013 08:07 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Unknown Object During Fireworks 2013","City":"Jasonville","Region":"Indiana"}
