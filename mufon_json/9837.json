(the attached photo was taken of the illustration todd drew, after bob reported to him that he'd seen an \"alien\" in late january.) slamming on his brakes, bob was stunned as a thin, gaunt, hairless, long arm, long legged creature, suddenly was caught in the high beams of his headlights. less than 20 feet away, this weird, 5 foot tall, slumped forward, long fingered entity darted smoothly across the road, alarmingly in 2 seconds flat! however, the real shocker came when it stopped under the yellow light of a streetlamp looming overhead, then turned, glancing in his direction! like the eyes of a cat, yellow light reflected back at bob as he tried fighting off the fear of the unknown. a riot of conflicting emotions and questions flooded over him. what the hell was it? what was it going to do? even as all this began welling up, he stared wide-eyed and shaken, as the unexplained nocturnal visitor silently turned and resumed fast, gracefully sliding strides, thankfully away to his right. bob's mind whirled as he watched it quickly squeeze through the partially open gate of a driveway. within moments, while bob's lungs finally filled with short, agitated breaths, the thing vanished into a line of woods on the far side of a field to the se. it was so difficult for bob to come to terms, let alone grasp, what to do after seeing something so profoundly peculiar, at such point blank range. in an absolute state of shock, the rest of his drive home was a blur. closing and locking the door firmly behind him, the true nature of reality wrestled with everything he had personally ever known. therefore, it was only natural that he refrained from openly sharing what had happened, fearful people would think him crazy. eventually though, he told his friend, todd, days later. being something of a hand as a graphic artist, todd worked extensively with bob to successfully reproduce the detailed illustration of the being i've termed, the creature of copper canyon. if all this wasn't already amazing enough, earlier that very evening, around the stroke of midnight, my wife, mary, and i witnessed a glowing, amber colored, chevron shaped object zooming through the sky. the ufo appeared to only be about 1000 feet up, and moved like a stone skipping across the surface of the water. looking up through our car's wind shield, we watched the flying object travel se down mckinney rd, for the approximate 2 seconds it was visible. (the ufo picture was taken by charles miller, in north carolina, in 2007; found posted on http:\\\\www.ufo-reports.com. i felt compelled to include it due to the astonishing similarity between it and the one my wife and i briefly saw on january 20th, 2008. remarkably, tuesday, february 26th, bob phoned, saying he had found the ticket stub, i'd asked him to look for, from the movie he had seen the night of his incident. our mutual exclamations of surprise must have reverberated for miles, as nagging suspicion became instant realization. the ufo we had seen took place only a few hours before bob's sighting of the creature of copper canyon! through getting the image and story out into the arena of public opinion, which has begun by appearing on www.coasttocoastam.com, we're hopeful that our observations and ongoing research into this bizarre chain of events, may engender others to come forward and share what they know. below is a link to a forum thread i made to discuss the creature of copper canyon and ufo sightings in denton, texas area ��� http:\\\\ufocasebook.conforums.com\\index.cgi?board=worldwide&action=display&num=1204321417 thank you, lance oliver, founder denton area paranormal society http:\\\\www.dapsghost.com"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.219131,+-97.130568(9837)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9837) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.219131","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Denton","Case Number":"9837","Summary":"Humanoid - Creature of Copper Canyon","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Denton","There was one other sighting in Denton on or around January 21st 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/21/2008 02:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
