First one shows nothing, then object appears in second shot, and then moves slightly lower in third. Didn't see anything until I looked at the shots right after, because of distance I didn't see anything until looking at the pictures. After tried to see if I could recreate shot, but no luck. We both thought that the object was solid, and not a flare, and the fact that it appeared in the 10 seconds I took the shots from one pic to the next is something we cant explain. No vapor trail or anything...it just appeared. I have never experienced anything like this...hopefully someone can tell me what this is."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33430.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33430_submitter_file1__040.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33430_submitter_file2__041.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33430_submitter_file3__042.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33430.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Log Number":"US-11172011-0040","Latitude":"47.311833","City":"Auburn"}
