This time only one was traveling, very fast. As a matter of fact faster than we have ever experience since we first saw them a week ago. I went to get my digital video camera to record it. By the time I got back it had disappeared. My wife says it took off quick and traveled to the same section of the sky as the other ones have done."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.600028","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/24/2009 08:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Oregon City","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light"}
