There were what appeared to be 3-5 at first. I tried to get a better view and when I caught the lights again there were 3 and then down to one. I watched the one move around as what seemed to be a couple others pulsating or flashing like. The one eventually just disappeared as it was moving in a cloudless sky. I lost sight due to them disappearing. My feelings are excitement..pure utter excitement.
