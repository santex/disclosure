We were all outside laying back in the grass watching the sky and talking about different things. All of a sudden we seen a something streak across the sky at a fast rate of speed and just disappear. I said it was maybe a satellite. Within 10 minutes here comes the HELLO signal. Not a plane nor anything in my 57 years I have felt like I have seen and I have seen a UFO when I was 8 years old. This didn't look like anything that was on a course as it moved like jumping around. Does a satellite give you a BRIGHT FLASH of light right over your head then move on. I believe whatever it was knew we were giving it all our attention and rather enjoyed us. It seemed to say Hello by the making the flash at us directly over our head. I would say it was few miles up but seemed to know what was directly underneath it, like US.....We lost sight of it because it left our eye range. We all felt it was acknowledging us below and it seemed to know we were all excited and talking about it...Interesting to say the least..."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Seemed to say hello to us with a big pulse of light.","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.141058","Date of the Event":"06/13/2009 11:32 UTC","City":"Sheridan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.141058,+-86.219289(17473)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17473) map </A>"}
