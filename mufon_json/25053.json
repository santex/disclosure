I took pictures of the object. The next night, I took a video of the object and then noticed that in the sky it looked like it stood in one place but when I looked into the camera lense, the object began bouncing around like a ping pong ball. I managed to capture pictures and videos of it. I remember feeling very curious to know what that orb was and to this day as I still see it every night. I never lost sight of it yet, it is still here."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Winnipeg","There was one other sighting in Winnipeg on or around August 9th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Diamond, Oval, Star-like","Log Number":"CA-08102010-0006","Latitude":"49.868509"}
