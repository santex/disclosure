Multiple objects, most star or sphere-like, moving in different directions, different speeds, but seem to concentrate near sun. Heard an IU astronomy professor has explained these objects as \"comet debris\" from comet McNaught . . . I'm a MUFON FI, STAR Team member, and amateur astronomer, but have never encountered \"comet debris\" A) in daytime; B) that stops, hovers, and changes course; and C) that sometimes flys in formation! These objects are high enough that witnesses in other midwestern states should be able to see them if they have clear sky. A large high pressure system is over us today, so am hoping this report will prompt folks to head outside and look (but not directly at sun!)"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24068.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24068.html"],"Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Peru","There were no other sightings in Peru on or around July 1st 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24068","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Latitude":"40.756363","Date of the Event":"07/01/2010 10:40 UTC"}
