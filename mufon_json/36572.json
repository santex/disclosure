He mentioned that he thought it might be a kite, but as we moved closer i noticed that it was also rotating. It was rotating very slowly and hovering directly in front of a building (Baker Tilly on the corner of Lahser and 696) almost at the top. At this point, my boyfriend had nearly avoided an accident i almost caused just trying to get a good look. And the best way i can describe it is, as two mechanical leaves swirled around eachother with the pointed tips facing down. I am currently working on an illustration since i was unable to get a photograph."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.484515,+-83.262929(36572)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36572) map </A>","Latitude":"42.484515","City":"Southfield","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03192012-0003","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36572.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36572.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other, Unknown"}
