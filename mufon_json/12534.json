When I turned to return to the house I saw a UFO hovering about 50 feet over the house. It was very close. It appeared to be black and triangular in shape with lights along the sides. It made no sound whatsoever and did't move at all. We lived near Barksdale AFB so I went in to phone the base to see if anyone else had reported this. No one had and the base said they didn't have any aircraft in the area. I returned to the yard and it was still there. The wife and I watched it for about 30 minutes until it slowly moved westward until it was out of sight. It was much too close to be mistaken for anything else. The strange thing was that there was not a sound or a breeze or a movement at all."],"City":"Bossier City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09172008-0029","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-93.724923","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.519855,+-93.724923(12534)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12534) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/15/1987 08:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12534.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12534.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/15/1987 08:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
