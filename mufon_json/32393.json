I was awoke by something unknown and went to the bedroom window and saw a disc shaped object on the back lawn. Object was approx 6 - 10 feet in dia and had lights and a dome, a classic saucer shape in fact. I stood and watched it for some time and returned to bed as I thought I was dreaming. It was only in the morning when I went outside that I realised it was not a dream as there on the ground was a perfect circle of discoloured grass. My Father also witnessed the evidence in the morning."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Log Number":"GB-10062011-0008","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Longitude":"-0.988148","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.462839,+-0.988148(32393)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32393) map </A>"}
