The light was white and occasionaly redish orange. It was at a further distance and traveling north and when I asked my wife to see it, I lost sight of it and it was directly above us. When I finally caught sight of it, my wife looked away and it vanished before my eyes. I didn't know what it was and I felt as if it was under intelligent control."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Silverdale","There was one other sighting in Silverdale on or around July 27th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Other","Date of the Event":"07/27/2013 10:33 UTC"}
