{"divs":["sighting detailsi was driving to work this morning heading south on i-75, when i looked out the window and noticed a very bright, white light moving slowly in the sky. for perspective, i was looking diagonally in line with the home depot you can see off i-75 near the tylersville rd. exit. i waited for the it to start blinking like airplane lights do, but it never did. the light source definitely was emanating from the object and not the ground. i watched it for about 20 seconds, then briefly turned my attention to the traffic, when i looked for it again it was gone. i scanned the sky saw a speck of it miles away now on the other side of the highway. then gone. reading earlier reports on the mufon site, this was identical to a report from last night, 9\\10\\09 with the photos."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19253.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19253.html"],"Latitude":"39.349562","Log Number":"US-09112009-0019","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash","Summary":"Bright, white light hovering in West Chester, OH.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"West Chester","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/11/2009 10:25 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/11/2009 07:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.349562,+-84.401758(19253)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19253) map </A>","Region":"Ohio","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-84.401758","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in West Chester","There were no other sightings in West Chester on or around September 11th 2009"],"Case Number":"19253"}
