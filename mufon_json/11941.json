Object darted back and forth, but did not leavethe general area.","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-08052008-0013","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"None","divs":["sighting detailsi was out last night (saturday night\\sunday morning) with my scope checking out jupiter, neptune and uranus. i was going back and forth from inside my house to where i had my scope set up. around 00:30, i walked out side and noticed a rather bright object in the western sky. it immediately caught my eye because it had a very strong \"twinkling\" effect. i watched it for a few seconds and i thought it darted around. i continued watching and noticed that it seemed to zig-zag back and forth and make other sudden movements. the more i looked at it, it looked like it was flashing red, green and white light. i woke my wife up to get her to look at it and she also could tell that it was darting around and flashing. i got my digital camera (i don't have a camcorder) and tried to shoot a video of the object, however it did not show up at all on the screen (i later looked at the video and the object can be seen, but not at a very good resooution and also i was not holding the camera stready enough). i assume that the avg. magnitude of the object was around -0.5. the object did not move more than about 1 degree in any direction as it darted around and stayed in the same spot in the sky for at least 45 minutes. mars and saturn and venus had already set for the night, so it could not have been them and jupiter was still hours from setting and well away from the object. i finally put my telescope on the object with a large eyepiece and got the object into view. the flashes of light were more pronounced through the scope and definately much brighter as i could see the red, green and white lights flickering (almost as if the object was spinning). i spend a lot of time looking through my scope and this is the first time i have ever seen something like this. any explanation will be appreciated. i did not experience any unusual feelings before during or after seeing the object other than expected excitement. i thought the object was an airplane until i noticed it darting around. i lost sight of the object when i went to bed about an hour later. it was still visible at the time."],"City":"Bellville","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"29.950225","Case Number":"11941","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.950225,+-96.257186(11941)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11941) map </A>","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bellville","There were no other sightings in Bellville on or around August 3rd 2008"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/03/2008 01:00 UTC","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11941.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11941.html"],"Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
