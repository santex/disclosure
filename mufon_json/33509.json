(note: sweeping as in data sweeps, which means that they picked up all frequencies and communications; which government officials have admitted to doing. also; potentially taking video or audio surveillance for unknown purposes) i look forward to any info i can get related to this event. thank you."],"Date Submitted":"11/20/2011 10:16 UTC","Longitude":"-84.962233","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33509.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33509.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.772382","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/20/2011 07:52 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Dalton","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.772382,+-84.962233(33509)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33509) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
