The aircraft emitting the contrail was almost to the western horizon by the time I noticed the contrail almost overhead. I only saw a glint of the aircraft in the very bright sunlight,(my angle of view was almost directly into the sun). It appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed. It travelled in a straight line from the southeastern horizon to the western horizon. I heard no sound at the time of the sighting, nor after. This could be consistant with other reports of top-secret experimental,(or operational?)military aircraft such as the \"Aurora\", or the \"X-33\".
