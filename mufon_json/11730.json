Therefore, I am submitting these events purely for the sake of your collection of data. I apologize for putting three stories into this one report, but I'd just rather do it that way. I hope it's OK. Experience 1 of 3 It was in 1967. I was 12 years old living on a farm in Kansas. I was on the second floor in my bed about midnight or after, not sure. I awoke to see flashing lights, like an ambulance, coming across the corn field hovering just above the corn. It came into the farm yard and hovered making all sorts of loud noises like sirens. A bright light lit up everywhere and that was the last I remembered till the next morning when I ask everyone at breakfast, ���What was that big light and all those sirens?��� Nobody new what I was talking about and it was accounted to a dream. Of course to me I felt I was not dreaming at all, however, it did stop after the bright light peaked. So I concluded maybe it was a dream, but really didn���t buy it. I let it go nonetheless. The interesting thing about this experience is what happened 25 years later. For some reason it started to bug me that I never resolved that experience I had at 12. I had insurance and wondered if I could get hypnotherapy to recall what really happened. To my surprised I was able to see a license hypno-therapist. It became legit because the therapist said it was most likely some trauma that caused the experience and I suppressed it to this particular memory. He put me under hypnosis and regressed me back to that night. I recalled the story as it unfolded while in my regressed state. The story was very similar to the memory I had except that I was able to see more of what happened in the farm yard. I was up out of bed and looking out the window. I saw two lights whirl around in a gyroscope fashion. They kept doubling until there was nothing but a ball of light and then the white out happened. When the session was over I ask the doctor what he thought about it. He said, ���I have no idea, perhaps a dream (?), but I don���t really no for sure.��� He did say there was no sign of trauma. One further note, after this session I found I had a very difficult time talking about it. I even wondered if the doctor, while having me under, put a notion in me to not talk about it. Because every time I tried, I���d wind up saying, ���forget it, I can���t talk about it.��� I would even get like a lump in my throat and words just wouldn���t come out. That was 14 years ago, it���s only been in the last 5 years or so I���ve been able to discuss it as before. Experience 2 In 1975 I was traveling with a friend in my car returning home from a day trip. We were just coming to the west end of our town. We both saw at the same time a green object with a sort of florescent light with a red light on the bottom. It zoomed across the sky going at least several thousand mile per hour. It went across the eastern sky, about the altitude of a jet, at about 45 degrees in about 2 seconds. It left a green florescent trail behind it that faded quickly but stretched pretty far. I stopped immediately in the middle of the highway (two lane road really, HWY 56 in Kansas). We got out and could see nothing. Both of saw and described the exact same thing. Experience 3 This was January 1, 1997. I was backpacking in the Mark Twain Forest of Missouri. It was about 11pm. I was sitting on a rock in the middle of a clearing watching the sky and saw 4 lights. If they had been motionless they would not have been detected because they looked exactly like just another group of stars. They formed a perfect box shape at first. They moved exactly together. Making squares, diagonals, all sorts of movements in all directions and most of the time staying in this box formation, but varying it a little. I watched this for about ten minutes, same thing over and over. They were very clearly there. Then all at once they stopped and about a half a second later, they broke formation and all spun out in weird spiraling ways in the opposite direction until they were gone out of sight which only took about another half a second."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.260017,+-96.819741(11730)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11730) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11730.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11730.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
