Thinking it might possibly be a blimp the overall aspect of which I was somehow misreading, I studied it hard until I could rule out, to my own satisfaction, any chance of it being a conventional craft. More than anything, it resembled a featureless aircraft carrier in the sky -- one with a superstructure and angularity that brought the word \"alien\" to mind, Moreover, it had a \"there -- not there\" quality I find difficult to describe. I asked my wife to verify my impression, but found her to be antagonistic about doing so -- as if inexplicably angry at the thing and the entire episode. Nevertheless -- she allowed that it was bizarre and inexplicable. Sometime after this, I emailed Bill Bean, a local UFO watcher and learned that he had witnessed it as well."]}
