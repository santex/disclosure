{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI am reporting this due to Gabe Spencers report. In 1984 I was living on the ranch we own in Mc Mullen county. I was outside on the deck of our home when I looked up and saw an orange orb. It was very large and self illuminating. It resembled the moon but smaller and closer. I froze. I did not feel any malintent from it. It remained stationary in the sky and made no sound. My parents were in the house and I wanted to let them know, but could not take my eyes off of it to go inside and tell them. I watched it for what seemed like and eternity, but appoximately 5 min and it just vanished. I have checked with MUFON over the years to see if anyone has reported something simular, but something told me to check in early August. After reading Mr. Spencers report I believe we saw the same thing, 25yrs apart. I have also found another report on MUFON that is simular. It is also around the same time as my sighting. MUFON may contact me, but I wish to remain anonymous."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/30/2009 12:41 UTC","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"20210","Country":"United States","City":"Tilden","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.463358,+-98.547458(20210)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20210) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/31/1984 08:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Tilden","There were no other sightings in Tilden on or around January 31st 1984"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-10302009-0008","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Orange moon-like orb","Longitude":"-98.547458","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20210.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20210.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Latitude":"28.463358"}
