I grab my camera and observed this orange, flickering object in the SW sky. I took a couple of photos of it for proof. It didn't do anything out of the realms of what we have as far as aircraft goes. I just want to know what my wife, daughter and I saw. When I first saw it I thought it looked like something on fire. It moved very slow and the orange color was very vivid but it would flicker . It's hard to say how far away it was. It made no sound at all. At about 3:00 am it disappeared into the sky to the northwest of my house. I thought it might be a hot air balloon but at 2:30 in the morning ? I called the Placerville airport and they have no report of anything in the area at that time. I'm scratching my head here. Please help."],"Latitude":"38.778934","City":"Placerville","Date Submitted":"04/25/2013 04:59 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/25/2013 02:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46985.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46985.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.778934,+-120.848161(46985)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46985) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Placerville","There were no other sightings in Placerville on or around April 25th 2013"],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04252013-0023"}
