I live in the mountains so I can see a lot of stars. I often see satillites so have trained my eyes to see them. I saw 2 objects (white) moving across the sky. These were further up than satillites and looked smaller. At first I was just watching one and then noticed another close behind it but higher in the sky. They looked about 20 to 50 feet apart looking up to the sky. I watched them till they went behind the trees. They were pretty hard to see as they were so tiny. Here's a map of how they looked in the sky. Sorry,no photos or video.
