On the way home we came to a stop sign at a high ridge. I looked to the right, thats when I seen it just over the trees line. I could not beleave it, but it was so big so clear. I ask my son do you see that. He said yes!!!! The craft was 1500ft away and only 50ft over the tree tops. The craft was a disk shape but on each end was like a ball. It had to 350 to 400 feet long. It was in the drection of my house and shops. I did not want to move as it was just hoovering over the trees. Under the craft the air looked like the air over a road on a hot summer day. After about 2 mins. I had to try to get closer. I turn right and speed after it. As I drove down the hill I lost sight it and when we got to where it was it was gone. I drove around and back to were we seen it but was just gone."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.250684","City":"Lexington","Region":"North Carolina","Tags":"City"}
