We said Yes. It was about a 30 minute drive East of Salt Lake and was in the Rocky Mountains. It was a beautiful summer night and since we were out of the City, we could see plenty of stars. The stranger lady told us to watch carefully and we did. As we watched, we realized there were many star looking objects that would suddenly jolt very quickly, instantly, across the sky. The strange thing was that they made sudden, instant turns of perhaps 90 degress more or less. At first I thought they were stars but their movement was way to strange for that to be. We watched for a couple of hours or less and left because it was getting late at night. I never saw the stranger lady again and often wondered why, how, when, and what she knew that I didn't."],"City":"Park City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"06/30/1979 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"4432","Latitude":"40.650202"}
