As we were headed toward the car we noticed a bunch of guys from surronding barracks were pointing toward the sky and talking excitedly. We stopped to see what they were looking at and saw a cylindrical object hovering right over our heads. I really don't know the exact size, but it looked large. It was right on top of us but it didn't make a sound. It slowly turned and headed toward the air field. Another thing that was strange, was you could hear all kinds of air craft at the field taking off. Usually you'ld hear a plane or two taking off, but this night it was constant engine sounds. We watched in awe for about 15 minutes then went to town."],"Summary":"Saw the same thing Doc saw on your email story from today!","Latitude":"36.663447","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Fort Campbell North","Longitude":"-87.47739","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.663447,+-87.47739(21057)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21057) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date of the Event":"09/10/1981 07:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12192009-0005","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply"}
