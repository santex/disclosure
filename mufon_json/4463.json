Looking up at a jet, trying to figure out its complexities a bright and shining star appeared next to it. The sky was a blue, pink, (30 prior to darkeness-sundown) The light had no flashing or indication of being a reflective light off a planet, comet, satalite, ect... It was clearly in our stratusphere, looked like a star, but wasnt, I looked all over the sky for something similure that I might write if off as, nothing out side of the blue of the sky was visible. I started hollering and shouting at my friend to notice it, and she had noticed it and we couldnt explain it. It was there for about 5 seconds, longer accourding to my friend who saw it appear briefly prior to its reappearing where I saw it. It disappeared, just ceased to exist after that 5 second period."],"Summary":"Sationary light appears next to jet for 5 seconds over Jackson Michigan.","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/20/2006 06:25 UTC","Latitude":"42.193371","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4463.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4463.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02202006-0007","City":"Summit","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Summit","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
