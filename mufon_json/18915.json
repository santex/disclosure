I was shooting a helicopter and caught something very odd in the middle photo. It is metallic looking on top shaded below and is moving very fast. I have no idea of what I caught. thought you might like to see the three photos and judge for yourselves if it is or is not. It is a puzzler for sure as the object had to be moving very Fast It was My Dad and myself and we where celebrating Fathers day with a fishing trip to a high country styream on the east end of Grand Mesa."],"Summary":"Object on photo that was not seen","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"18915","Log Number":"US-08272009-0008","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other"}
