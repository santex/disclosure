Thers a blinking object way way high up in the sky. I see no outline of this thing. Its just a light that blinks about every 15 seconds or so and it dosen't move. I watched this flash in the same part of the sky to the right of the moon here theres 2 pretty bright starts directly to the right of those stars this thing flashed for a good 30 minutes before it was gone. It was in the same exact part of the sky. I don't go out that often this time of night but i've managed to see this twice now in 2 weeks. NOT a satellite NOT a plane. Unless its the really really slow kind."],"City":"Abilene","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There was one other sighting in Abilene on or around October 30th 2010"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-99.731044","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26215.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26215.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"26215","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Blinking Star Like","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.454236,+-99.731044(26215)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26215) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/30/2010 03:42 UTC"}
