We watched it as it passed overhead and traveled to the North. It made no sound that we could hear. I watched it until I couldn't see it any longer. As it passed over, I noticed that it was below the few patchy clouds in the area. It was glowing orange and seemed to have some sort of pattern of lighter and darker areas on its surface. I could not make out a definite shape. We see lots of aircraft in this area, but this was not anything like what we might usually see. It had no wing lights, no flashing red lights, no head lights--just a pulsating orange glow."]}
