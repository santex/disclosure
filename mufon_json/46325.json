Noticed light in field moving toward the road I was driving on. The light appeared to be constant luminiscent. As it got closer I was able to tell it was hovering and appeared to be about the size of a refrigerator. I slowed my vehicle before coming to close to the object. My lights on the dash began to flicker along with lights of the vehicle. The object continued in a straight path across the road and into a wooded area. I lost track of the glowing object when it entered the wooded area. I called my parents very concerned about what I had just seen. I arrived home about 15 minutes later."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46325.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46325.html"],"Case Number":"46325","Object Features":"None"}
