I observed a twinkling low in the sky star like object in the Southwest skies of Oakland County. Too low to be a star so I went for the binoculars. Once focused, I was viewing an oval (ish) object hovering with blinking red, blue and magenta like colors. It also had a brighness in the middle. It seemed to change colors in repeating bursts. I went for the telescope in another room. By the time I get it positioned, the \"craft\" was gone. This was no fixed wing or rotor aircraft. Did anyone else see this?"],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Royal Oak","There were no other sightings in Royal Oak on or around April 6th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:30","Longitude":"-83.143248","Latitude":"42.4931","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Michigan","Log Number":"US-04082010-0016","Case Number":"22715","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Summary":"Oval, flashing-multi colored lights."}
