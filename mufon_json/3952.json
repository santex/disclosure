As I was driving (between mile markers 5 and 2), I noticed what looked like a \"new\" white radio tower light up ahead in the vicinity of two tower lights that are red in color, which I am accustomed to seeing. As I got closer, I realized the light, which actually discerned into three small lights in a tight triangular pattern, was not atop any kind of tower whatsoever and was in fact not moving at all, hovering instead. The triangular object was to my right as I traveled south, dark against the dusk sky. I simply continued driving, glancing up often as I drew nearer and ultimately passed the object on my right. After I realized it wasn't a tower light, my second thought was maybe a stealth bomber, since the shape would lend itself to that type object. I also know it wasn't Venus, which was in the western sky at sundown."],"Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Cincinnati","There were no other sightings in Cincinnati on or around October 4th 2005"],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.107218,+-84.50382(3952)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3952) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/04/2005 08:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Was driving south on Interstate 71 toward Cincinnati, saw light; later discern three lights in triangle pattern hovering near two radio/TV transmission towers.","Latitude":"39.107218","Log Number":"US-10042005-0006","Case Number":"3952","Date Submitted":"10/04/2005 08:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Longitude":"-84.50382","Region":"Ohio"}
