They were bright like fire balls and hovered in the sky. I began my video on my iphone but could only capture 3 of them, but there was 5 in the sky. As one disappeared, another one would rise from the tree tops. After a couple min of watching we decided to go in the direction that they were spotted. We lost site of them so we turned around, when we got back to his place we saw another one rise. if you notice on the 11 second video if you zoom in at the end, it seems there is more of a vehicle structure attached to the light. In total we saw approximately 8-9 orbs"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/15/2013 10:21 UTC","Region":"Ontario"}
