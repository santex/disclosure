Very quiet neighborhood on a hill. Listening to evening bird calls, very quiet. Object was luminous and orb shaped. Came over the house across the street (to the North)and passed overhead without a sound and continued towards the South. Straight trajectory, very slow moving, silent. I watched until it disappeared from my view behind another house. There were no wings, blades, or protuberances, and it did not change shape or color. It was not a lantern or a helicopter (in my opinion). Waited for another 20 minutes but it did not return."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Cambridge","Date of the Event":"04/01/2009 08:10 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/01/2009 08:10 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Spherical object, silent, passed directlly overhead at 500'.","Longitude":"-80.313188","Tags":"City","Case Number":"16422","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.367661,+-80.313188(16422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16422) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"Canada","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-04062009-0005","Region":"Ontario","Latitude":"43.367661","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16422.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16422.html"]}
