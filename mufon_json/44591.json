Tonight is a crystal clear night with no clouds. I noticed the 2 red glows appear from a building not far from my hotel. At first I thought it was a plane heading towards my hotel. It was 2 red glows with white circles around the glow. I ran inside the hotel from my balcony to get my phone and the 2 lights seem to be getting farther and farther away almost seeming to be heading towards space. I had never seen anything so amazing... I know it sounds stupid but I know what I saw. I lost sight when it seemed to be gone an out of sight (heading into space in seconds)"],"trends":["There have been 112 other sightings in Orlando","There were no other sightings in Orlando on or around December 16th 2012"]}
