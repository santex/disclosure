We didn't notice the object when we first took the pictures. The pictures uploaded are the original pictures that were taken from my girlfriends 8MP digital camera. I also took a picture with my camera phone. Both pictures were taken within 2 minutes of each other and the object is still in the same spot. The object isn't as clear on my camera phone but you can still faintly see it. I have also added a photo of the object zoomed in 200%. I am not saying that it IS an alien craft but it is pretty unusual. I have showed all of these pictures to some friends of mine who are familiar with different commercial and military aircraft and stated that it doesn't resemble anything that they are familiar with but it also isn't clear enough to make a actual conclusion of what it is. What do you think it could be?"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Atlantic City","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14229.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14229_submitter_file1__20081016_71.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14229_submitter_file2__ufozoom.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14229_submitter_file3__l_4c955101ac22d9856c0970169d44fc79.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14229.html"]}
