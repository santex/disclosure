{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 2:30PM, my brother and I were in our back yard when we saw the UFOs. He stopped and I asked why, he said \"Look! A UFO!\" I looked over the mountain line where he was pointing, and saw a black, egg-shaped figure. It was round on the bottom. It was like a side-ways oval. The figure was moving slowly, moving south-west to north east. It picked up speed as it went until it dissapeared. Then I saw a inverted pie plate traveling east, slowly. It then disapeared behind a tree where I couldn't see it."],"City":"Myersville","Date Submitted":"05/20/2007 02:30 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Myersville","There were no other sightings in Myersville on or around May 20th 2007"],"Date of the Event":"05/20/2007 02:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Square, Rectagular","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7049.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7049.html"],"Case Number":"7049","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05202007-0003","Summary":"2 UFOs, 1 moving slow, the other fast. moving back and forth.","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Maryland","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.514431,+-77.557677(7049)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7049) map </A>","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-77.557677","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.514431","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Dome"}
