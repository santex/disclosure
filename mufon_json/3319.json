could this be some kind of military craft? this does not fit the description of the usually stealthy quiet white saucers people report, and i know what transport helicopters look like. please please respond (rachellandry@cox.net) - what this thing might have been has been haunting me for years. thank you"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"3319","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Not Provided","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Woonsocket","Region":"Rhode Island","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3319.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3319.html"],"trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Woonsocket","There were no other sightings in Woonsocket on or around February 25th 2005"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/25/2005 05:48 UTC","Latitude":"42.002876","Date of the Event":"02/25/2005 05:48 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.002876,+-71.514784(3319)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3319) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":""}
