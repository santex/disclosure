I spent 10 years as a helicopter mechanic, the rest a fix wing mechanic. I've seen a lot of aircraft, and weird things in the sky, but nothing like this. I just walked off a plane I was working on and outta the corner of my eye something caught my attention . I looked up and saw a bright light like a landing light off of a plane, but the run way is to my left to right this light is at a 90 deg. to the run way. the light looks like its coming right at me. I realized there is no position lights, and no wing landing lights, and even tho its dark you should see the silhouette of a out line of a aircraft. with this light there wasn't nothing. Then the light retreated from me very fast to a pin point, the size as a star in the sky, then zipped to my right, and disappeared."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.525942,+-122.668287(30559)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30559) map </A>","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were no other sightings in Portland on or around July 31st 2011"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-122.668287","Latitude":"45.525942","Log Number":"US-08022011-0030","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"a bright light that moved away from be at a incredible rate. it faded to a pin pint like a star then shot at a 45 deg. to the right and was gone.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30559.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30559.html"]}
