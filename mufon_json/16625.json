(i expected the light to move to the left or right as it might if a plane was in trouble and looking for a place to land). but, the light just stayed in one spot. the light was about 1-1\\2 miles away and it was a big-big bright light shining and i was getting closer and closer. i came to a stop sign and the light was shining into a field on my left and was connected to a large triangular object. but, as i drove under this object, it made no noise. something told me to stop and scrutinize this thing but, something else told me to keep going and don't mess with it. i just kept going while looking at it through my truck mirrors and noticed bright flashes. i thought that it might be strobes or electrical flashes. as i continued to look through my mirrors, it just disappeared. i didn,t realize it at the time but, it had been hovering over power lines. my feelings as i passed under this thing were mixed. i wouldn,t call it fear but definately apprehension. i have heard many stories of things happening to others who got too close or too involved with these things; things like abductions, machinery shutting down. i kept looking through my rear view mirror to see if these lights (this thing) was behind me. i was getting ready to load my shotgun and use it (for whatever that was worth) if that thing followed me. if that thing had any devious intentions involving me, they would have to work for it."],"Date of the Event":"04/17/2009 05:25 UTC","Longitude":"-74.403091","Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"40.065974","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.065974,+-74.403091(16625)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16625) map </A>","trends":[],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16625.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16625.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"16625"}
