It just set there for over 20 min and then faded as it moved away toward fallbranch Tennessee from Jonesborough. It moved very slow no sound.I have recorded something similar during the day could be some kind of drone. I was able to take some video of it with a high resolution camera and save frames that I blew up in photo shop. I have listed both to see. It did have all of the dogs in the area barking for quite sometime. This is one of many sitings from my home that have been reported here. We are both amazed that we have seen so many things like this from our deck."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"bright red round orb"}
