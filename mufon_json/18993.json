{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out in rural area southwest of town at a private pond fishing. We were standing on the bank facing east. The pond is about an acre and is surrounded by woods. There is open area around the pond and where the woods stop is a large opening looking back towards town. My fishing partner noticed it first and brought it my attention. From my right (south) I saw a huge pair of metalic cylinders with a tube joining them together. It didn't make any noise and I couldn't see any wings.The shape was unlike anything I have ever seen flying through the sky. The speed was slow for size of it and it flew a straight line path. Appeared to slow down even more as it neared a US Army Military Arsenal close to town. Distance was approx. 2-3 miles, weather was partly cloudy & visibility was unlimited. We watched for nearly a minute and lost sight of it due to trees blocking view. Wish I had caught it video!!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18993.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18993.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-08312009-0022","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Arkansas","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/31/2009 10:43 UTC","Case Number":"18993","City":"Pine Bluff","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Pine Bluff","There were no other sightings in Pine Bluff on or around November 30th 2002"],"Object Shape":"Cylinder, Square, Rectagular","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.232281,+-91.994896(18993)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18993) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.232281","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-91.994896","Date of the Event":"11/30/2002 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Looked up to see a strange shaped object fly across sky"}
