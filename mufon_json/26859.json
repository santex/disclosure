It was glowing and then going completely dark. It moved up and down and sideways. I looked at it through my binoculars and saw that it changed shapes, appearing sparkly like diamonds with different colored lightning bolts running through it. At one point it looked like a plate on it's side when it was moving sideways. I have previously seen similar type objects in the same direction of the sky. It is always on clear, cold nights."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Dome","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Egg, Fireball, Oval","Summary":"An object in the northwest sky appeared brightly and then going dark and bright again.
