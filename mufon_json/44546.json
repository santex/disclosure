{"Summary":"light in sky, moves at seemingly impossible speed and then dissapears","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.615594","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsSaw a light in the sky while driving a tractor-trailer westbound on interstate 94 approximately at milemarker 22. It came from behind me, and flew to about 30 degrees above the horizon and dissapeared instantly. There were no clouds. The object did not have any navigation lights, landing lights, or strobe lights like a plane. I saw the object for less than a second, it moved at an incredible speed, far faster than anything I have ever seen. It appeared to be between 15,000 and 20,000 feet above the surface. It held its altitude and did not appear to be descending, may have been slightly ascending. Did not have a tail like a meteor, and I have never even seen a meteor go anywhere near that speed. There was heavy airline traffic into and out of Chicago and Gary airports, as would be expected for the area, no other traffic was seen on that flight path though."],"Case Number":"44546","Log Number":"US-12142012-0010","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"12/14/2012 05:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/14/2012 11:07 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Porter","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.0742","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44546.html"],"City":"Porter","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.615594,+-87.0742(44546)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44546) map </A>"}
