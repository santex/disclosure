We were on our way back from the lake. I saw a metal object that had a rather odd spherical shape, and I made a joke that it was a UFO. I looked it at and figured it had to be some kind of airplane, as it was shiny and silver, but the shape was too strange. It was moving in a line from the S to SW. It then stopped and hovered, then completely disappeared. The whole event did not last long. I lost sight of the object as it disappeared into air. I had immediately checked to find out if there were satellites in the area, there weren't. It was also still light outside. Unfortunately, my husband did not see the object."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Bauxite","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bauxite","There were no other sightings in Bauxite on or around August 15th 2013"],"Region":"Arkansas","Longitude":"-92.501092","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"49900","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.545868,+-92.501092(49900)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49900) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08162013-0015","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/15/2013 07:45 UTC"}
