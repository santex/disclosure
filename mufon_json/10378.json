(300s) after the jets left and it seemed as if there wasn't going to be any more obol tonight, i took my cameras and went home. once i arrived, i stood outside for a few minutes, camera in hand, watching. waiting for something i could feel in the air. at about 10:10 pm i finally gave up and came in. i got my jammies on and went into my office to work. at precisely 10:24 pm there was a tremendous explosion outside my window. the window shook, my chair shook, my monitor shook, and it sounded like something fell on my roof and then off. (i need to go outside and see if there is anything or anybody laying in my yard!) i thought i had seen a flash of light out the window in my office that faces southwest. it all happened so fast i can't remember if i saw the flash before or after the explosion. i jumped up and ran in to the bedroom and woke dave up screaming, \"something is wrong, something is wrong!\" i had the hair standing up all over my body. i still do! about 5 minutes later my son, casey, called me. he is at the cab company in town. he says, \"mom, are you guys okay?\" i said, \"yeah, why?\" and he proceeds to tell me that a plane has crashed close to our house! i jumped up and ran into the bedroom to tell dave and then i called glen back. i ran outside to see if i can smell anything or see anything. i can't do either. i do hear dogs howling and barking like mad again. so i go back inside and up to my office to flip on the tv because it's 11 pm now and the news is coming on. first off the bat is a breaking news: explosion in tipton county at the howard\\tipton county line! they had a caller from kokomo on the phone. she said that someone reported seeing 2 bright flashes of light and then the explosion happened. and the report said there was much debris strewn about the area. now they've come back on and said the faa in indianapolis reports no missing planes! i am here to tell you right now, that explosion has something to do with the military and that bright amber orange light i saw tonight. i saw the light! i saw the jets scramble and sweep the area after the light disappeared. i have a strong feeling those military jets and that bright light have something to do with this crash. i witnessed something tonight. i have been thinking about skywatching all day today. i knew i was going out tonight and i had a strong feeling i was going to see something but i didn't think it was gonna be like this! i tell you there were at least 10 military jets sweeping that area after the light appeared and they were flying without their wing lights on. something was up and i have no doubt this crash is related to what i saw"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"10378","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/16/2008 09:38 UTC","Longitude":"-86.125953"}
