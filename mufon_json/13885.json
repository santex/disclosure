the way this thing moved! the points of the triangle twisted and turned, flipped and flopped, left to right, and back and forth in every which direction, but never the same direction in a row; this movement wasn't fast, but was continuous. a stealth fighter i can only imagine would fly straight. while this object flew in one direction, its three points moved in many directions while the ufo seemed to slowly glide across the sky like it belonged there. to go back for a moment, when it became most obvious what this was; the center point of the triangle was pointing up towards the sky and the blue lit center was facing out, not so much straight down... seconds later its center point of the triangle was facing straight down, then another change and for a moment i didn���t notice a blue light, then the next move the center point was flying straight like a normal stealth fighter would, with the blue centered light facing down towards the ground. the ufo had three points with white lights, and what seemed to be a solid black metallic triangle shape, with an obvious blue lit center that was illuminating. i could see how others would drive on by, as my first thoughts was it can't be a ufo, even when it started becoming more convincing, i couldn't imagine it grabbing people's attention as everyone rushed around in the cold, music on in the car, kids or friends to be distracted by. it was so obvious that people wouldn't believe what they were seeing anyway. me on the other-hand, i was by myself, was in no rush, and had no distractions. while all this started to settle in as it almost seemed for a minute time stood still, it didn���t freeze long enough, as i realized it was moving away and that i had no proof of what i seen. i thought quickly of possible jumping out of my car and making a big seen to grab other drivers attention by pointing in the sky, but a safe instinct jumped in mind and i quickly pulled my car into the seven eleven parking lot on trenton rd and oxford valley rd in langhorne, pa; where i jumped out my car and finally took out my camera phone.... then i thought there is no point of trying to take a picture and miss the last seconds of this move off towards my left into the far horizon��� it was just too late; the only image i would have had would have been a distant blur of lights. i immediately called family members, and when i later arrived home still shocked of this night���s event as i still am now hours later, i began searching on the internet for bucks county ufo, to see if there were any other witnesses to what i saw. what i have found is that there has been much activity in my area over the last few months, it has even been broadcasting on the local news. all of this was kind of a relief as at least i know i am not the only one who witnesses something unusual. but the most important video is the following link http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=kfiqvrshpyk this video is supposedly from my area of bucks county, but wherever it is from, it is real! this is exactly what i seen tonight, except this video was said to have been captured on october 14th. tonight���s date is november 11th, and i swear on all i have to offer in life i never seen anything like this before, and knowing what i saw was a true ufo��� alien or not, it is something very odd and this video is it! is the government testing some new craft in this area? either way i sure am very interested in watching the skies all the time now. i do believe my view was better than this video and i saw it a little closer, but this video is real as i am a witness to this exact craft in clear sight. please also see this video from october 8th, just a few miles south of me in the city of philadelphia. it was in the middle of the day, but you can clearly see how there are three lights. what most people may think that they are separate objects, but seeing what i saw tonight and how this thing moves, these lights are one triangle object moving in many directions. http:\\\\abclocal.go.com\\wpvi\\feature?section=news\\bizzarre&id=6438673"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"39.959235"}
