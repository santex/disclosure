Its in the same area I captured Video of the last one. It���s a matter of time before I get a really good closeup shot of these craft. The next 2 pictures are from my Vacation to Maine while I was fishing at the Ft Williams Lighthouse cove. They were just random snapshots of the area as it was so beautiful this time of year. I was catching Striped bass and sea trout in the cove. There are other pictures but this is all I'll post from this adventure. More Pictures and possibly Video to follow. Thanks for looking JC"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Other, Unknown"}
