Anyway tonight was totally clear no clouds in the sky at all. She pointed out something in the sky which seemed unusually bright to be an airplane. It was an illuminating bright with no flashing beacons that typical aircraft would have. Since all aircraft have some sort of lights (beacons) or strobe lights flashing on them I was puzzled to not see any. it just seemed like it was a star but a very bright star. So we both observed this Very bright object moving from south, southwest to northeast in the sky and then all the sudden it got dimmer and just faded out completely. This seemed like it was similar to the Portage sighting reported earlier in the morning."],"Summary":"Bright star like object in the sky.","Case Number":"16328","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Michigan","Date Submitted":"03/31/2009 09:10 UTC","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Midland","There were no other sightings in Midland on or around March 31st 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
