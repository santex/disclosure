I started to watch it. At first I thought it was a reflection from the sun on to an airplane. Saw the side of the object, it was extremely shiny like a mirror, and was turning north. It proceeded north going slow at first then sped up. It was white at this time, and it had no wings, no tail of an airplane. It was a small craft. I live next to a military base and haven't seen this before. As it sped away, don't know if it disappeared or if it just went to fast to noticed."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.608885","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Oval","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50338.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50338.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/16/2013 12:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"white object in sky","Case Number":"50338","Log Number":"US-09012013-0014","Region":"Oklahoma","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.608885,+-98.474721(50338)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50338) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/01/2013 01:24 UTC","Longitude":"-98.474721"}
