It was some time during the summer at night. John had to go inside to go to bed to get up for work. I went to walk away when I was frozen in my tracks and looked up in the sky north of my nanny's house, there was a transparent cloud which glowed from the inside out with a cigar shaped UFO in it which just hovered, I felt as if the whole town stood still. I do not know how long this lasted but I know I was missing some time. I sent out a letter to my cousin yesterday to see if he saw it too. I was not afraid, I just went home, which was three houses north of my Nanny's house. Approximatly one year later there was an article with drawings of what I saw in the Naugatuck Daily News in Naugatuck Ct 06770 that a man there saw the same thing that I did."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Beacon Falls","There were no other sightings in Beacon Falls on or around July 1st 1975"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"I saw a cigar shaped UFO when I was 15 or 16","Region":"Connecticut","Log Number":"US-08262008-0012","City":"Beacon Falls","Disposition":"Hoax","Date Submitted":"07/01/1975 09:00 UTC"}
