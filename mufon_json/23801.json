(*name deleted) said it must be coming from a helicopter. i said no way and parked the car on the side of the road and rolled down the windows. look, hear there is no sound or vibration to the light. there is no visible craft. we watched it for a few minutes and then it vanished like turning off a light switch. later i heard and investigated a light that appeared frequently on a neighboring hill in brea. this phenomena was attributed to a religious experience and had many witnesses. there was a huge attempt to turn the area into a shrine to st. joseph!
