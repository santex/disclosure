On the way back to the store from the organics dumpster I was looking at the stars which I normaly do. Anyway,as I was looking up I saw two dull white lights side by side traveling a little faster than an aircraft. Thought it was an airplane at first but there was'nt any engine noise and I thought to myself that aircraft have colored lights.The two lights seemed to be fairly close together. Just as I hollered at my co-worker to look at the lights they separated from eachother at a 90 degree angle from their travel. They went quite a distance from eachother then just disapeared. They were'nt like any falling stars I have ever seen and were'nt as bright. My co-worker said it was a falling star or a satellite falling, even though he didnt see it. I've never seen falling stars travel side by side and seperate like these lights did."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Cortez","There were no other sightings in Cortez on or around March 15th 2010"],"City":"Cortez","Region":"Colorado","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23154.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23154.html"],"Latitude":"37.356333","Log Number":"US-05052010-0020","Summary":"2 dull white lights travel together then separate"}
