When initially sighted I observed the object for a few minutes and it appeared stationary. However after walking away only to return some minutes later and standing at the same exact spot I noticed that it had moved. Now the object had moved a littler further off from its orginal position. I also observed that when it brighten the ojbect appeared to turn into 2 orbs. Of course I am not convinced my eyes were playing tricks on me as this object was high in the sky. I can not explain what it is I saw but found it odd that a bright round object could sit in a stationary position in the sky."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.19448,+-75.443071(32549)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32549) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
