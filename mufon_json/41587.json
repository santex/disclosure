We think it's fun to be the first of us to spot a satellite, bat, owl, shooting star, etc. This night a bright object passed directly over us and the slight cloud cover and I got to be the first to spot it. I thought it was a shooting star, it was so bright. It was moving west to east. We're used to seeing satellites get brighter as they catch the sun and I quickly changed my opinion from shooting star to satellite because it was bright and moving slower than a shooting star. Pretty soon my wife asked \"Shouldn't that have dimmed by now?\" I had to agree with her. She stated she thought it was lower than a satellite and I agreed. I speculated that it might be the ISS, not knowing it's location. We watched as the object continued east until it went out of sight, approximately 5-6 minutes. It never lost it's brilliance. We lost it because it went beyond the horizon."],"Longitude":"-91.827693","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed"}
