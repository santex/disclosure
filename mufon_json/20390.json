I then noticed the white light moving in an intercept course with the lower plane. At first I thought that the object was a star before I realized it was moving. I thought it was strange that they looked to be so close, much less going to intersect. The plane was moving in a straight westernly direction and as the white light almost touched it, the white light seemed to accelerate and make a hook shaped maneuver away from the plane. The white light was still moving when I lost sight of the plane and white light as they were blocked from view by the building. I parked my car and got out, looking back in the direction that they were, but I could no longer see the plane or the white light."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.840579,+-75.150277(20390)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20390) map </A>","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Woodbury","There were no other sightings in Woodbury on or around November 5th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"11/08/2009 11:01 UTC","Case Number":"20390","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.840579","Region":"New Jersey","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States"}
