It was a very clear night. I allways watch the sky. I am very interested in UFO's. I saw 2 airplains with red, blue, and white flashing lights going by and as I was watching the planes I saw a small ball of light it moved across the sky faster than the airplanes were traveling, but not fast like a shooting star it was definatly no plane. It moved across the sky in a very steady path. I then noticed 3 more of the airplanes. It was allmost as if they were patrolling the ball of light not following it.The next evening my boyfriend and I wittnesed the same thing but the ball of light came from a different direction I had seen it fly by virticly this time it came over the house horazontaly.We watched it untill it was out of sight and once it was gone so were the airplanes.When we saw it my boyfriend said he was not sure what it was. I knew I was seeing something that was no plane,star, or sattelite. I am currious if you have had any other reports in my area?"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"08/23/2005 08:30 UTC","Latitude":"39.20144","Country":"United States"}
