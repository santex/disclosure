We both saw a bright red object come off the ground of a cornfield and shoot straight into the air and was out of sight in seconds. I asked my wife if she had seen it and she had. This was a pretty large field in the country and I haven't a clue as to what it could have been. I noticed the object which was to my right and ahead of my current location because it was so dark out and the red light was very noticable. My initial reaction was to ask my wife if she had seen the object. We talked about it for a little bit wondering what it was but didn't dwell on it since we had no answers."],"Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"28963","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/06/2011 12:00 UTC","Summary":"BRIGHT Red Light 8-10 Feet in Diamiter","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
