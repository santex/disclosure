I first observed the lights while sitting in my work truck around 2100 hrs, they were 800-1000 meters SE of my location at about 50-100 feet off the ground. I immediately got out to get a better view, the lights were only visible for approximately 5-10 seconds. Not enough time to take a cell phone video. They were organized in a horizontal line traveling slowly to the west. I am not sure if the lights were part of a larger object or separate from one another. They emitted a very bright orange light and faded in and out sequentially, the rear light would fade out and then reappear in front. Possibly indicating a rotating object? I can only speculate. If it was an aircraft it was moving to slow to achieve aerodynamic lift and I could not hear any noise. After the lights were gone I continued scanning the sky to see if they would reappear somewhere else. After a few minutes I spotted two orange lights hovering near a brightly lit drilling rig 5-10 miles to the west. These two moved independently of each other moving slowly in opposite directions. They were visible for about 15 seconds and were also somewhat dimmer. A few more minutes passed and I observed a single orange light hovering above the rig for around 10 seconds. Finally after 20 minutes of continued observation I saw a dim orange light at what seemed to be a far distance(20+miles)climbing in elevation of a few thousand feet at 20-30��� from my viewpoint before it faded out. The lights seemed to be followed by two aircraft but I can't be certain. The planes appeared to be on a SW intercept course with one at low elevation and the other high. There is an airforce base nearby and their course came from that direction. The planes made a about a 50 mile loop and returned in the direction they came. Not sure if their presence was related. I have seen similar lights before so I was sure that these were the same lights. I was pretty freaked out with the hair on my next standing up, it's not something I can explain. Could be natural, man made, or of a higher intelligence. A truck driver asked if I \"had seen any UFO's\" about an hour earlier. I wonder if he saw the same thing."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/15/2013 05:43 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Tilden","Longitude":"-98.543868","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Tilden","There were no other sightings in Tilden on or around February 13th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.462728,+-98.543868(45713)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45713) map </A>","Case Number":"45713","Latitude":"28.462728","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Log Number":"US-02152013-0007"}
