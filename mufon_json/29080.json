(note: i have seen plenty planes in my life to know, that the sudden change of direction for this craft wasn't typical of a jet liner) anyhow it headed my way and zoomed just about 1000ft just a few houses short of where i was and headed north\\west. i was able to video table a good 5 minutes of the sighting but i dont have a source at the moment to upload my video. i was using a cannon elura, which is a older model video camera."],"City":"Addison","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29080.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29080.html"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/13/2011 02:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.934816,+-87.984076(29080)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29080) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Addison","There were no other sightings in Addison on or around May 13th 2011"]}
