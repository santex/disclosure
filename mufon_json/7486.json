As most , if not all ,kids want the window seat .So, after a while, gazing out the window (a row or two behind the rt. wing) she says she see's a \" ?thing? \" moving around the wing of the plane! Thinking quik ,she reaches for her cell phone and records the object in motion with the plane ,keeping with the same speed as the plane(cruising with no effort) ,but moving left to right under the wing .At times slow ,then very rapid .She recorded 2 events within 2 minutes.Clearly on these videos an \"object\" can be seen moving under the wing as if it were ' examining or probing ' the \" primitive\" jet .(after witnessing this , i prayed for her &[passengers] safe return- u never know?)
