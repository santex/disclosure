I would not have thought much of it except that it was moving exceptionally fast. I took a quick photo of it then went back to taking pictures of the farm and other scenery as it continued in a straight line. I really thought nothing more of it at that point other than it was just a really fast jet. At the end of the day I downloaded all of the photos in a batch download and had forgotten about the photo of the jet. Just recently I was going through photos and purging them off of my hard drive. When I got to this photo, I decided to zoom in to see what type of jet was moving so fast. To my surprise, I did not see a jet but an outline of something that appears to be round in shape with a dome top and using some type of cloaking system. I personally think it is some type of military aircraft but wanted to forward it to you."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Windsor","There were no other sightings in Windsor on or around April 4th 2010"],"Case Number":"43479","Source":"MUFON"}
