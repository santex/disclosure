That was unusual to say the least. It was then reported on our local news that another sighting had occurred the night before in Stephenville which is west of my location. I live off Interstate 20 in Grand Prairie, Texas and Stephenville is located off the same interstate. It was reported by the news that the local Joint Reserve base was claiming they had F-16s out the evening before but I've never noticed this many contrails before. These contrails were not fresh as they were thick and fluffy not like the usual ones we see around here which are thinnish. The time we saw these would have been around 7am. They were all over the sky but several headed off in an easterly direction following the interstate. It could be related to the air force's claims of maneuvers but it was unusual enough to get our attention."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/24/2008 07:10 UTC","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.744277"}
