Brilliant star light the whole time. No FAA blue and red flashers. It looked like the helicopter was following because it tilted forward a bit to pick up some speed. Anybody east of Lilburn see a single star light object about that time?"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
