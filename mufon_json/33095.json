{"divs":["sighting detailsi live south of the golden gate bridge. about 11:45pm on 10\\02\\2011 i was looking out my window facing north to north-east at a planet(?) or star which was somewhat dim due to background light. i then saw an extremely bright white object 'falling' from the sky about the same size as the star from my vantage point. i say falling because it almost tumbled like a leaf in a semi-zigzag pattern. was extremely bright and moving very, very fast. this didn't look like a shooting star but i'm not ruling it out. could have been 'space junk' or something burning up from entering the atmosphere. seemed to be right over the gg bridge or near it over sf bay. was not an airplane. i see planes often over the bay and this object was not a plane. anyone else see that?"],"Log Number":"US-11032011-0005","Longitude":"-122.410796","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.7811,+-122.410796(33095)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33095) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/03/2011 03:21 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/02/2011 11:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Windy","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There were no other sightings in San Francisco on or around October 2nd 2011"],"Summary":"Unidentified Falling Object","City":"San Francisco","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"37.7811","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33095.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33095.html"],"Case Number":"33095"}
