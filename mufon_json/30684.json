AT THE TIME WE WERE MOVING FROM OAHAU TO THE BIG ISLAND FOR TRAINING (MILITARY) AND WAS GETTING READY TO BED DOWN. SOMEONE LOOKED UP IN THE SKY AND BROUGHT IT TO OUR ATTENTION. OUR THOUGHTS WERE IT WAS A UFO. WE HAD BEEN UP FOR ABOUT 24 HOURS WITH NO SLEEP AND WAS GETTING READY TO BED DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.
