They were glowing red a bit fuzzy around the edges and pulsating, in the center of each was a white light. Two of the objects disappeared, one kept flying north until it went higher and disappeared. I was looking for someone else near me, but no one was around and I did not have a camera. I noticed it because they were very distinct and I'd never seen anything like them before. I was a bit stunned and in disbelief, I could not readily explain what I had seen it was a very clear night. I've been thinking a lot about it, I wanted to report it, but didn't know who to report it to!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.540807,+-90.479322(37388)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37388) map </A>","City":"Fenton","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Fenton","There were no other sightings in Fenton on or around April 9th 2012"]}
