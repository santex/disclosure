We did not make much of it since we were close to Ramey AFB. This happened on two ocassions as I recall it. As the years passed by,I realized that we do not have that technology- I forgott to mention that this objects came out of the water at an incredible rate of speed after some 30 min. under water. This event was witnessed by 10 to 12 surfers that were there at 600. am. I remember telling my father, at that time he was a college professor and he advised me not to talk about it because it might be a secret weapon against the communists-Cubans! Now I am 54 yrs. old, and that was no military weapon! What it was, only God knows!"],"City":"Rincon","Date Submitted":"12/31/1970 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"9781","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.297029,+-81.22774(9781)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9781) map </A>","Log Number":"PR-02292008-0002","Country":"United States","Latitude":"32.297029","Object Shape":"Disc","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9781.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9781.html"]}
