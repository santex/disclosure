{"divs":["Sighting Detailswe live close to the Lake. I was sitting on my sofa and noticed out my front window a hovering object that continued to flash green and red lights. There were no planes out that I know that can sit idle for 10 minutes or longer and continue to stand still. The object was just above the tree tops over the Lake. It was dark out, pitch black, all I could see were the lights. I opened my door to listen for the sound of a plane or helicopoter, nothing. No sounds whatsoever. I watched for several minutes and the lights continued to pulsate with different patterns, one time it would flash green for several seconds then red, then the red would flash for 5 or 6 times and this went on for some time. I was going to call my son at college but I wasn't sure if he'd be awake and at the time, I just assumed it was a plane. A month or so later, I saw an article in the Plain Dealer and a man by the name of Nick Hill also saw the same thing and he videotaped it on the east side of Cleveland. l"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"13911","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11232008-0008","Date Submitted":"02/20/2007 10:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13911.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13911.html"],"Summary":"Green and red flashing, pulsating lights over the Lake.","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ohio","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Cleveland","There were no other sightings in Cleveland on or around February 20th 2007"],"Longitude":"-81.693709","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.500595,+-81.693709(13911)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13911) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/20/2007 10:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.500595","Tags":"City","City":"Cleveland"}
