It was a lot larger than the stars and did not appear to be outside our atmosphere but it did appear to be very high in the sky. From the time I noticed it till the time it disappeared about 20-25 sec. had passed. It never moved and no sound came from it. The light it emitted was basically a glow, not very bright but not very dim. It was there then it was gone. We were camping at what we called high camp which was half way up to Jicorita Peak in Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico. We had no idea what it was and so far has been a once in a lifetime experience."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Taos","There were no other sightings in Taos on or around June 1st 1994"],"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/01/1994 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.416638,+-105.566236(43133)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43133) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"43133","City":"Taos","Date Submitted":"10/10/2012 05:39 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43133.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43133.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-10102012-0010","Latitude":"36.416638","Summary":"We saw in the sky an orange stationary light 10x larger than/star for approximately 20sec. then it disappeared."}
