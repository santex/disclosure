{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI have had 2 very close encounters and 1 as well that I witnessed over my area where I live. I would report these but it's easier to explain. The first sighting occurred in August just before school started it was 11:11 at night and me and my 2 friends were sky watching on st.pete beach when we didnt c anything we started to look Down and our breaths were taken away as we saw this blue orb coming towards the beach and it stoped just above where the waves were breaking on the shoreline and as we looked underneath it we saw this small almost glass like child sized figure and it paced the beach for about 15 yards till one of us spoke to see if the others were seeing it and it froze where it was and looked at us and the hole time the orb was above it... But as we saw it turn towards our direction the orb strobes 3 times so bright that it was unbelievable and after the light it was just gone... And we were scared shitless, we sprinted all the way to my car and went straight home & I never remember running that fast in my entire life. Then the second sighting happened when it was me and my same friend from the 1st sighting (mike) he by the way is always there too. We this time were sky watching at Jungle Prada And we witnessed these massive orange orbs that came from no where and at first there were just 2 the A 3rd showed up in the blink of an eye. They hovers rotated and flew over the area we realized was the first place we saw the child figure and blue orb ( st. Pete beach). This all happened for ruffly 4 minutes till the orbs just dispersed. Then my next sighting occurred ���in Seminole and this is the one that terrifies me to the core of my being... Me mike and 2 of my other friends had just pulled up at a bridge near Osceola high school and we were waiting for another kid to show up. And once again right around 11 my friend mike and I noticed that every thing was earily quite and the street lights started to just turn on and off but we thought that was normal. But then they started going all spastic then they just stoped and right as mike looked down at his phone to say \"weird it's 11:11\" a very loud rustle and thump came from the waters edge and I locked eyes with a massive being that was 7 to 9 feet tall skinny, slender and it was dragging a massive bag. One that looked like u put a Christmas tree in but what terrified me were its pure white glowing Florescent eyes and then dipped under the bridge... Tears still come to my eyes when I talk about this and I'm absolutely serious that I had to draw it to just get it off my mind because it was just burned into me as an image"],"Case Number":"36915","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"03/27/2012 10:57 UTC","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in St Petersburg","There were no other sightings in St Petersburg on or around November 15th 2011"],"Longitude":"-82.63143","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.779326","Date of the Event":"11/15/2011 11:11 UTC","Summary":"Struck me with a sense of unknowing and fear","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.779326,+-82.63143(36915)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36915) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36915.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36915.html"],"Log Number":"US-03272012-0019","Region":"Florida","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"St Petersburg","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering"}
