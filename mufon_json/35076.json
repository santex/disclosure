{"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.285503","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at my storage unit and looked at the horizon for no reason when I noticed a blinking light. The light was different and it did not compare to anything I have seen at this location. I am very familiar with the air traffic at this location because I have been coming here for years and have seen all types of air traffic at all times of day and night in all types of weather. I sensed something about this light and decided to get my camera.It acted too different so I knew it was interesting. Shortly after seeing it,I use a Flip Digital camera and was not sure if it would even pick it up. I filmed it and I became more interested and decided to get my binoculars so as to see if this was something I could identify. I put my camera down and viewed it. When I finally found it in my viewfinder it rose at a somewhat 45 degree angle and either imitated a planes lights or placed itself behind a plane , it seemed to me it had done something deceptive. I watched what now looked like a standard flashing plane(jet)lighting pattern and it continued on a lateral course until I became bored and stopped watching."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.285503,+-72.518357(35076)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35076) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"35076","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Clinton","There were no other sightings in Clinton on or around October 8th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-72.518357","Region":"Connecticut","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"01/23/2012 05:21 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01232012-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35076.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35076_submitter_file1__pkorb166.png.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35076_submitter_file3__eforb24.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35076.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Fast blinking , many colors , odd movements - (dramatic) enlargements show amazing color","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/08/2011 07:41 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Clinton"}
