(I am very interested in astronomy.) A gold light went from east to west, faster than a high plane (like the usual planes that fly overhead) but it was definitely high altitude. It was a gold ball of light, no blinking. It went a long ways, much farther than a meteor would (which I've seen many of, as well as meteor showers) and it was much brighter than a meteor. It was a bright gold light as long as I saw it, and did not change shape. I tried to move to the north side of my house to keep it in view, but it either disappeared by the time I got there or was blocked by trees. The irony is I was just shooting videos on my HD camera and didn't have it in hand at the time. There was no cloud cover or possible reflection from lights in the town I'm in."],"Latitude":"40.606385","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sutton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18823.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18823.html"],"Region":"Nebraska","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.606385,+-97.859688(18823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18823) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"None, Unknown","City":"Sutton","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18823","Date of the Event":"08/22/2009 10:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None"}
