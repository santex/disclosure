We saw two shooting stars (5 minutes in between). A few minutes after the second shooting star, we saw a very fast, oval like, object that had an orange glow. We first noticed the object when we were looking at a blinking star to the North East. When we first noticed the object we thought it was commercial plane. We then realized that planes do not glow orange or move as fast as the object we saw. The object was moving in a straight path moving outward to sea. The object was also gaining elevation as it was moving forward. During the sighting of the object were we very confused and debating what it could be. The object then disappeared as if it was never there. After the sighting we were in shock and very excited about our experience."],"Object Shape":"Oval","Date of the Event":"08/24/2013 11:05 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/24/2013 11:47 UTC","Region":"Maine","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.526588,+-70.365327(50134)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50134) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"43.526588","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-70.365327","Object Features":"Dome","Log Number":"US-08242013-0031","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Very Fast, Oval like, Orange glow, Vanished"}
