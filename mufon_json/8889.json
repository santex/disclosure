No one sighted anything unusual during the daytrip to this island. However, upon receiving her pictures back from the developers, she noticed the strange object in the upper right portion of the picture. It appears to be symmetrical and disc-shaped. The photographer's immediate reaction was that it was a UFO. In fact, she was so concerned about the object that she kept quiet about it for several days before forwarding it to a few people for their opinion. I have zoomed in on the object several times in an effort to \"debunk\" it, to try to see if it might be a bird, hat, frisbee, kite or anything else, but I cannot based soley on its appearance."],"Country":"Puerto Rico","Case Number":"8889","City":"Ponce","Longitude":"-66.605162","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"18.013177","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Ponce","There were no other sightings in Ponce on or around December 8th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Disc-shaped UFO caught on camera"}
