A plane few by it and the object remained still. She was looking in the sky and noticed that it was not moving for quite a while. She first thought it was a plane but realized it wasn't moving. Saw steady object with lights. Seem to be bright one minute then dim another minute. Seems to separte every minute. When separtes seems to be 2 separte lights. Can's identify due to be so far away. My mom was quite excited and her husband was quite distraut. He truely belives in UFOs. He saw one when he was 16 years old in Montreal around 12pm at night waiting for a bus. Looked like a green light, ball shaped. Right at this moment it looks like it's moving away as if they know we are looking at them. We'll still looking at it for awhile and will report again in the late morning."],"Sighting Duration":"01:18:00","Case Number":"6019","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in St John's","There were no other sightings in St John's on or around December 28th 2006"],"Summary":"Steady unidentified object in sky","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.612957,+-52.743291(6019)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6019) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6019.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6019.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-52.743291"}
