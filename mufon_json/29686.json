{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was about twelve midnight, I was driving easbound, when I noticed two bright lights in the distance off to the North. They appeared as though they were stationary, so I thought they must be helicopters or possibly stars. I didn't think anything of it at first, but I noticed one of the lights was slowly getting closer. As it gradually came nearer I noticed it was a cluster of lights. The object appeared to have three distinct lights on three corners of the vehicle. It appeared to have red lights and faint pulsating dim lights on the underbelly. I wanted to believe it was an airplane, but it moved like no other vehicle I have seen before. The object appeared to be extremely low for an airplane, and it was completely silent."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","City":"Memphis","Summary":"Triangular in shape, bright lights on all corners of object with red lights underneath.","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-90.04768","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.150734,+-90.04768(29686)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29686) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29686.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29686.html"],"Object Features":"Appendage(s), Wings","Date of the Event":"06/23/2011 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06232011-0004","trends":["There have been 62 other sightings in Memphis","There were no other sightings in Memphis on or around June 23rd 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"29686","Date Submitted":"06/23/2011 05:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Latitude":"35.150734","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Tennessee","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
