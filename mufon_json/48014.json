It was lower than the moon and it dissipated before it touched the ground. It had no sound that I could hear, but it looked like it was miles away. It has a glowing tail, like a comet tail, behind it. It took about 6 seconds for it to fall and dissapate."],"Date Submitted":"06/09/2013 09:39 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Oregon","City":"Roseburg","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Roseburg","There were no other sightings in Roseburg on or around January 12th 2011"]}
