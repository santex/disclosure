Liv in Lake Tahoe and obsevered a white flashing light every 40- 50 seconds flash once. Not a jumbo jet or heli because it is at least 40,000+ in the sky, maybe even in earth space orbit. I know that airliners have to have a becon light while flying over Tahoe, but this light was stationary. I watched this for aout 5 minutes and then came inside to report this sighting. I just went out to see if it is still there and it is not. Also I see the space station from time to time pass by but this just sat there."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.235446,+-120.019946(46682)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46682) map </A>"}
