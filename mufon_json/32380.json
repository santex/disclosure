THe lights were all facing downward. She said that it took off at a fast speed, then returned and hovered right over their vehicle. Her boyfriend took video of it with her cell phone and she is sending it to me. The object then just floated away slowly."],"Summary":"Large craft moved away then back right over our vehicle","Longitude":"-94.597336","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 9 other sightings in Kansas City on or around October 3rd 2011"],"Date of the Event":"10/03/2011 08:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/05/2011 06:59 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10052011-0026","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Kansas City"}
