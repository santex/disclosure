I was walking down the lane way at my house we had recently washed all our pathes. I stopped to admire the mountan called mt.wellington then suddenly a bright light came accross the sky. It seemed to be on fire or crashing my first immpression was that it was space junk burning up in the atmosphere. But if that were the case it would have dissapated up in the outer atmosphere. And it was moving quite fast flares were comming of it then it went behind the mountan. I had been felling fine all day before and after."],"Tags":"City","City":"Hobart","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Hobart","There were no other sightings in Hobart on or around November 9th 2009"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.539139,+-87.253435(20391)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20391) map </A>","Case Number":"20391","Object Shape":"Disc, Egg","Summary":"i saw a flash then it came into focus it seemed to be burning up or crashing.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:00:12","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20391.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20391.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"AU-11082009-0019","Date Submitted":"11/08/2009 11:16 UTC","Longitude":"-87.253435","Latitude":"41.539139"}
