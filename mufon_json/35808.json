When we got home I looked to the sky to see three military jets flying in a circular motion around the city and surrounding area. To the south I witnessed a bright object I had originally believed to be a star or planet to the west start to descend slowly and eventually disappeared. As I continued to watch the jets fly around the sky I saw a bright object hovering slowly at an altitude higher than the planes to the East heading West. Then in a split second the object accelerated at an extreme speed Westward and disappeared into cloud coverage. The jets continued to monitor the skies for about another hour."],"Country":"United States","City":"Boise","Case Number":"35808","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35808.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35808.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.594016,+-116.254097(35808)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35808) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown"}
