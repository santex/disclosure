The sky was busy with chopper rides and two ulralights buzzing the area. About 6:05pm we noticed a pair of objects that looked as if the were joined together similar to barbells bright orange in color. They floated down to about a thousand feet and stopped, they did not move for about fifeteen minutes and then joined together to become one ball without gaining mass. The helicopter continued to fly and the sky diver came in with the flag to start the show. We looked back up and the object was still there and it was 6:40 and the balloons were working to get aloft. The balloons filled the skys and the orange ball shrank slowly in moments until it was no longer there, almost as if it evaporated."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-83.369018","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.202023,+-83.369018(41892)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41892) map </A>"}
