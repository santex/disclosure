{"Region":"Idaho","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and niece and i were going to go to the gym. About a week before I saw a triangular shape of lights at the same time. This particular morning we saw two bright lights, along with others that appeared to come into the sky and go away, the two hill lights appeared for about 2 minutes then were gone. We all saw them. My son and neice went inside then I saw two sattelite looking lights, one approached the other and stopped then the other moved to the south and dissappered, when i looked for ther other one it was gone also. Very strange, both events, I know there is a dump located in the vacinity, but these were not gas lights, and the locales of each was definently in the sky."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10534.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10534.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10534.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Eagle","There were no other sightings in Eagle on or around April 14th 2008"],"Longitude":"-116.318005","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Eagle","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"43.687057","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.687057,+-116.318005(10534)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10534) map </A>","Date of the Event":"04/14/2008 05:44 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/14/2008 05:44 UTC","Case Number":"10534","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Lights in Boise foothills.","Log Number":"US-04252008-0005","Source":"MUFON"}
