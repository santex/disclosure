Second orb appeared and vanished multiple times and blinked, as if playing games with us.","Date Submitted":"06/20/2013 12:17 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my back porch with my boyfriend smoking a cigarette. I was looking over my glasses and saw a light that looked too bright to be a star. I looked up and it was a bright yellowish-white orb that moved for less than a minute and vanished. About a minute or so after the first vanished the second appeared, and after I tried to point it out to my boyfriend it disappeared. When I stopped paying attention to it, it reappeared and once again vanished. I continued to look in the general direction and it blinked about 3 or 4 times before it went out completely. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, it looked like a star only brighter and moving. I tried to catch it on my phone but my phone died before I got the chance to. I kept my eye on both objects while visible until they just dimmed out until they seemed to vanish."]}
