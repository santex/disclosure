The jets came so rapid one right after the other in all directions and continued what appeared to be a sweep of the location and then after about 15- 20 minutes all the jest left the area. The object appeared round, cannot say if it was disc like, it just seemed odd, not natural, it flickered light but the light also appeared to be the sun reflecting off the object. Why all the jets, why did they arrive to the same spot where the 'object' was. Curious."]}
