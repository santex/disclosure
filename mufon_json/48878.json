{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/07/2013 10:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my girlfriend where preparing to go to sleep. And when I look out through the window in the bedroom I saw this big light. And I told to my GF, \"Come, come and see this\", the light was flickering (it might be a chinese lantern but I think it was to big, and uncommon in my town especially over a village). On the left I had storm clouds coming in and on the rest of the sky was clear. This Light slowly moved behind a cloud and never saw it again this took around 5 minutes. After a few second in a cloud clearing I saw a rapid white flash of light, after that I went to bed. I could have filmed this. But because my camera is really old and I think my sensor is acting up (makes some lines on the entire image) I did not film this. To bad because It was amazing. This event took place a few days after I saw another light traveling to NW."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"21.217077","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.776958,+21.217077(48878)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48878) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Large star like object Red-Orange in color Flickering.
