At first glance I thought it was a helicopter or an airplane. But when I looked out the window a few minutes later it was stil there. I foucused on the lights for a few minutes trying to see if it was a helicopter. I couldnt tell so i got my telescope and tried viewing it. I noticed it looked like it was spinning in one spot so I grabbed my camera and went outside to take a picture. The light did look like an object but was not circle. But since it was spinning it looked like a circle. When I snapped the picture a bunch of lights formed around it as if it was more than one object leaving a trail of lights all over. so i believe this was a ufo sighting"]}
