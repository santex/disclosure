(20 deg above horizon).. a sequence of 5 flashes of white lite once again a split second of each other but the first 3 flashes came from one spot.. the next 2 just to the right of each previous.. generaly (last 5 weeks): they move north to south east to west (viceversa) 80% of the time.. but i have seen them moving in all directions in all parts of the sky.. they do seem to go one way and come back the other soon after ~40% of the time.. usually when traveling north south but not always.. this seemingly \"driving drunk\" characteristic discribes 75% of these stars that i see.. this makes it obviously \"not a satellite\" which move at a constant speed\\direction w\\ no deviation.. satellites dont change speed or direction or make u-turns or hover.. the satellites i see seem to move south to north.. i know their orbits can be fixed.. i imagine one can put a satellite in any orbit...w\\ speed and direction constant or fixed.. another common characteristic is the fading in and out... sometimes it seems like they jump a little bakwards or forwards left right up down as they fade in and out.. i see this about 50% of the time.. ive seen as many as 4 in different parts of the sky at once.. less than a week ago.. i was watching 2 in the sky at once.. one moving south to north one moving west to east convergeing (at a point facing east looking 75 deg above horizon).. the one moving north was white and fading in and out.. the one moving east was orange and wasnt fadeing in and out.. as they converged.. before they crossed paths.. the one moving north flashed 4 random bursts of bright white flashes as it faded in and out.. at this point just before they crossed.. the orange one moving east let out a burst of brown plazma or hazy looking field around it in its horizontal plane.. kinda like a shockwave.. then they crossed at the same point at the same time and went on theyre ways over the horizons.. ive seen these flashes bye themselves in other parts of the sky a few differnt times w\\ no stars associated w\\ them.. a few weeks ago.. facing west (75 deg above horizon).. i saw a single short \"line\" of white lite flash in the sky.. the orientaion of the line was east\\west.. (note: the line appeared all at once.. not from one end growing to the other).. when the lite flashed.. a star came out of the east end of the line and continued east... very interesting.. recap: 10-8-08 (nitetime) once again...i saw atleast 10 more... but tonight was significant.. tonight i feel that whatever it is im seeing has acknowledged that im watching them.. while facing east..i was watching another star in the north\\east moving south over houston.. as it passed a few miles south of 1-10 south\\east of my position.. it stoped and made a left hand u-turn.. then gained altitude as it started to head north east then stopped completley...hovered around unsteadily.. i stuck my head in the back door and called for my wife to come out and see this one...she came out.. and as we were watching it for a minute .. out of the east an orange-ish sparkling lite headed west about 300 - 400 ft off the ground came directly over our house at about 50 mph... it made no sound at all.. it was just cruisin west... almost all the others that i have been watching (approx 70 in the last 4 weeks) appear to be well above 30,000 ft.. but this one was very low and came right at us.. right over my house.. to me it seemed to be an acknowledgment.. why all of the sudden so low and right over my house.. while im watching one of them in another part of the sky..? due to this low flybye over my house.. i think they somehow know i see them.. i think they wanted me to know that they know.. lately i have wondered if i was special because of what i see that others dont.. i am not... i think its simply because i looked to see.. look up and see the truth..!! how i find them in the sky: its really very easy.. all i do is look up in the sky.. in sections systematicly.. (imagine a grid of rectangles or squares).. i focus on groups of stars at once.. paying attention to their fixed postions relative to each other and look for moving objects against a fixed background of stars in each grid\\section.. i focus on the fainter stars in each grid to adjust my eyes to see more lite.. ussually \"they\" are easy to see.. but some are very faint.. i dont want to miss those.. i have noticed i have gotten better at finding them in the sky as time goes on and look at bigger sections of sky at one time now.. i know what im looking for now.. hopefully this will help others see what i see.... i havent reported this to anyone officially.. they will think im crazy.. maybe if others can also see.. we can come together as a group.. and discuss what to do next... how or if we should disclose this info.."],"Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-95.814776","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.788065,+-95.814776(13009)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13009) map </A>","City":"Katy","Date Submitted":"11/07/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"the stars have been moving for over a month in katy tx","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10112008-0007","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
