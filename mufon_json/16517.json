(i then closed my eyes and rubbed them with my knuckle to make sure that it wasn't possibly a glare from the light being so bright). . it was no glare. . the projecting lines, or what we called them at the time \"wings\" came out and were pulled back in for around 15-20 minutes, sometimes projecting out longer in length than others. . it was aparent that we were seeing the same thing and it was no glare, because when they were at a longer length, we both reacted at the same time explaining exactly what we were seeing. . . after watching this for around 30 mintues or so, we then saw another light going in the direction of the object we had been observing. this i easily identified as an airplane, (due to the flashing red lights) however, when the plane got somewhat close in the direction of the object, we then saw the object take off at a rediculous speed and a weird angle almost arching upward towards the sky. .we watched as the object got smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it. after the plane passes , we're still looking at the same point in the sky that the object was . . and out of nowhere, we saw the object fly back, at the exact same position and point in the sky as it was previous. . this was amazing. . after calming down, from what we saw, we continued to observe the object as it continued to project the wings, then pull them back in. afterwatching for another 15 minutes or so, we grew tired, and went in the house. later,a bit after 9:00 pm the object was nowhere to be seen. . my brother is a very straight laced,mature adult (39 years old) and a police officer. . . for me to witness this with someone that i look up to, someone that i believe (if i had mentioned or told him a story like this,that he hadn't witnessed with his own eyes, he would never believe me) i've always been a believer of extraterrestrial , ufo findings etc. . but always had that bit of doubt in the back of my mind. . after seeing this with my own eyes. . and with my brother being there seeing the same thing, backing me up. . . there is no doubt in my mind that aliens,ufo's,and life on other planets do exist. . . i have 5 , 30 second video clips, plus a picture taken with his nextel i880 video phone as proof. . not the best quailty, but i'm glad we had something to capture some type of evidence that we saw something out of the ordinary. . . i will be recording a video explaining exactly what i saw, this week, followed by all 5 video clips and picture summing up what we saw march 8th 2009 any information of groups or organizations in the metro atlanta georgia area that shed light, investigates, or just has other witnesses of ufo's and extraterrestrial life would be appreciated. is there a mufon ga? aaron gordon"],"Region":"Georgia","Date of the Event":"03/08/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Case Number":"16517","Date Submitted":"03/08/2009 12:00 UTC"}
