ironic, along with the fact that the cd was made that day and we just happened upon that song. we left my window open for awhile trying to get just one more sighting, just to feel that almost comforting, calm, and tranquil feeling again. what has brought me to giving my experience to mufon, is that i've seen more unexplained events afterwards. orbs that turn into airplanes, some star treck\\star wars looking craft hovering above a feild just 15 feet above the ground and rising slowly. i have never seen white owls until after my first experience. i know how stupid it sounds but research i've done makes me believe owls have something more to them. i mean i've seen 7 owls take off my roof uniformly, in a v-shape towards where i saw the first amber orb. shortly after they were out of sight i saw a white orb, in the same spot as the amber one, flight to to same highth in the sky, turn amber and almost flatten to disappear. i watched for about an hour and it did not go down my street this time, unfortunately. there are very many witnesses to these owls, and a friend of my sister, who experienced the phoenix light phenomena (amber orbs) in the nineties has had strange dreams and experiences since moving to stanislas county. friend's of mine, and people i don't even know have reported seeing these amber orbs. in daytime, nightime, dusk, dawn, twighlight. everyday school kids are seeing the orbs that turn into airplanes, a new one every week. i actually saw one while trying to describe them to one of my friends, sitting in his car around the coner from my house one night. he saw this also. my sister and her boyfriend said they had seen a strange airplane at the same time i had when i got home, they had asked me before i had said anything if i had seen it. so many multiplying strange events have happend since the first. an amber orb following my sister's boyfriend home from work, just twenty feet above his truck and mimicking his speed, almost messing with him. he felt calm, and in awe. so many similar, strange and unexplainable events. i don't know what to think anymore. i really think mufon should reasearch this area of california. i really do. sightings and experiences are increasing as the year ends, i can't wait to see what is in store for our nation in 2007. i have never experienced a ufo or unexplainable event until 2010, and it is no shock that i found out it is the year for ufo's in california. we are infested."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-12272010-0010","Summary":"My bestfriend and I were leaning out my window staring at the night sky and an orb shot straight up into the sky and made its way to my house","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date Submitted":"12/27/2010 10:33 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Sphere, Other","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Latitude":"37.73604","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Region":"California","Case Number":"27138","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Riverbank","There were no other sightings in Riverbank on or around August 16th 2010"],"City":"Riverbank","Source":"MUFON"}
