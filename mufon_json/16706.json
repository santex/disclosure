It was hovering but too high for a helicopter and not moving like a plane .... it went northward after about 30 minutes . It was as if it were standing above the city - when it moved it was slow to the north . I stopped looking to call local PD which must have thought I was crazy and said look up aviation or something .... We all looked at it , no one had a good answer of what kind of craft it was . It disappeared from where we could see due to trees . But it was a neat experience ."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","City":"Kansas City"}
