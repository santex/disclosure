I focused on it abd saw that there were four royal blue lights. Three in triangle shape with one in the middle. I tried to get a clear look at it but it seemed to try to stay out of my direct line of sight. I ran down a hallway under my apartment to get a better look and wasnt able to see it again. From the moment I saw it to right know I still have this feeling that I have to see it. I will be watching all night."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.742127","Longitude":"-97.101666","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23153.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23153.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"None"}
