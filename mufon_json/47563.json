{"divs":["sighting detailsat 3:30 am, we saw what looked like a harvest orange moon out the formal living room. to get a better look, we went outside and saw an orange large orb with no clear defined edges. it was about the size of a 1\\3 of a normal moon, very bright, made no sound. seemed far away. at first it did not appear to move, but then it quickly sank into the horizon, like a setting sun. no zig zag movement, just straight down. we did not know what it was at first and the moon was above us, so it could not have been an eclipse. by 3:36 am, it had disappeared."],"Summary":"orange orb appeared stationary, then sank into the horizon like a fast setting sun at 3:36am","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"26.151336","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.151336,+-81.79295(47563)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47563) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Naples","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Longitude":"-81.79295","Log Number":"US-05212013-0018","Date Submitted":"05/21/2013 10:55 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/21/2013 03:36 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47563.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47563.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Case Number":"47563","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Naples","There were no other sightings in Naples on or around May 21st 2013"]}
