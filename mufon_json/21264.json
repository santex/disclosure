Thinking they were balloons I watched moving about the speed of approximately 150-200 mph going to the northeast. To my amazement there started appearing several more. I hollered for my wife to bring the benoculars out which she did. She did and watched them with me. This continued for about 20 mins which there were multible silver round globes moving about the same speed in the same direction at the same height, approx. 5-6000 ft. They were flying above the heavy storm clouds and could be spotted between the breaks in the clouds. They were not balloons weather or any other type of balloons. I was puzzled about them and never discussed them with anyone other than my wife and never considered to be a ufo until I started thinking about them and started considering the possibility of them being a extraterrestial craft."]}
