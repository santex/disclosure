I saw a huge spherical object which had bright lights all around it. I stood there for about 2 minutes watching the object before it disappeared so quickly that I didn't even see it move and I was left confused wondering if it was ever even there. Just wanted to report this in case there were similar sightings around that time, it would be nice to have some confirmation that this really did take place. I feel really baffled about the experience and told a close friend of mine who recommended that I should write to MUFON in case there were others who shared the same experience."],"Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.336897,+-83.042514(24900)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24900) map </A>"}
