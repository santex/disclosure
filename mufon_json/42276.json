{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile driving to work on Route 1 express heading toward Morrisville, PA I saw a bright object in the northeast sky. I would have to estimate that it was about 3000ft above the ground and I was approx 1 mile from the object. The object didn't appear to be moving but it was hard to tell as I was driving in my car doing about 60 miles per hour. I never actually saw the object only a bright reflection. The time of day was approx 6:30am. Sun rise was at 6:19am on the morning of August 28, 2012. After about ten seconds the bright object disappeared. I didn't see what was causing the reflection. No plane. No helicopter. No blimp. About 20 minutes later I saw another bright reflection in the sky. This time I was on New Jersey Transit train and was just pulling out of the train station at 6:46am. Like before the object simply disappeared. I didn't see what was causing the reflection. There were no clouds in the sky."],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Fairless Hills","There were no other sightings in Fairless Hills on or around August 28th 2012"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.181584","City":"Fairless Hills","Log Number":"US-09032012-0023","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42276.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42276.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"09/03/2012 07:12 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-74.852534","Date of the Event":"08/28/2012 06:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.181584,+-74.852534(42276)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42276) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Case Number":"42276","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Star like reflection that disappeared in a blink.","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
