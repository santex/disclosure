{"Log Number":"US-08092013-0022","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe city was hectic due to two window cleaners hanging off a falling scafold on 57th Street and 8th avenue. I was walking towards Port Auth on 8th avenue and 42nd street when a couple of ambulances rushed pass me and I looked up towards the East when I saw this object hovering towards the right side of the Chrysler building. Helicopters and a plane passed by it. The more I looked at it, the more I realized I had no idea what I was looking at. I was able to take a picture and as soon as it did it vanished. I took the picture with my iphone 5, I know it's not the best picture but I was happy to take it."],"Case Number":"49648","Date Submitted":"08/09/2013 04:59 UTC","City":"New York","Summary":"It didn't look like anything i've seen","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-73.991217","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"N/A","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.757826,+-73.991217(49648)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49648) map </A>","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49648.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49648.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.757826","Date of the Event":"06/12/2013 03:30 UTC","Object Features":"None","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around June 12th 2013"]}
