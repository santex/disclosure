And was prepping my patrol vehicle, when I noticed 3 lights to the north of my building. 2 were orange and 1 was red, they slowly drifted toward the west. Each had a different altitude, and although they didn't seem to be in formation they didn't change distance from one another. I observed them drift to the west against the easterly breeze for about 2 minutes.. in that time they didn't get very far.. maybe another half mile west.. I went inside quickly to retrieve the binoculars and night vision.. maybe a minute later I came back outside expecting to still see them approximately where I had last saw them as they weren't moving very fast, honestly expecting to make out Chinese lanterns thru the binoculars.. but all three were gone.. from where my building is I have the highest vantage point in all of Wilkes Barre.. and I could not see them down the valley to the west.. they were gone.. kinda disappointed.."],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
