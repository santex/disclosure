I then got my camera out and started video taping it. The pulsing light then started to fall to the ground leaving another still hovering in the air. Once the object that was falling disapeared from view (behind the rooftop of a house) the hovering object still giving off a flamelike apearence then started slowly moving to the north. The object then disapeared seemingly into the clouds. There was fireworks going off in the area but that was another few blocks west of my location for some kind of fireworks convention. Note: eventhough I was only able to capture 1:31 seconds on video, the event time was longer"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-86.711717","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana","trends":["There have been 32 other sightings in La Porte","There was one other sighting in La Porte on or around August 14th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"00:01:31"}
