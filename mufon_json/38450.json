(it never took off, just a slow drifting\\hovering). i went out front about 20 minutes later hoping to see it coming back, i guess, but alas it was long gone. i couldn't even run inside to grab my ipod touch to take a picture or video. i was too afraid to miss anything, and honestly i was glued in place."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Kentucky","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Case Number":"38450","City":"Vine Grove","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38450.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38450.html"]}
