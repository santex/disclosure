{"Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"8692","Longitude":"-117.643668","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was leaving work in Ontario California in October of 06 it was about 5:00. There was a plane leaving the airport so I looked up to watch it. I was south of the Ontario International-otherwise known as the Los Angelas International Airport of Ontario California. To the north in the background and at about the same low altitude as the departing plane I saw a silver sphere between the plane and the mountain range. The sphere was moving west and steadily gained speed and altitude. Within a matter of about 10 seconds it had flown out of view. It never changed shapes and toward the end of the event it was really hauling ass. I had mentioned this event to a friend who sent me an e-mail response on Oct 24th 2006 so it was before that date."],"Log Number":"US-12252007-0023","City":"Ontario","Latitude":"34.067894","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"10/22/2006 05:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"silver sphere","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8692.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8692.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/22/2006 05:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Ontario","There were no other sightings in Ontario on or around October 22nd 2006"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.067894,+-117.643668(8692)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8692) map </A>"}
