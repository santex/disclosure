I think personally it was an unidentified object. I am writing you this note because I noticed something you may have not noticed in your video. I see the black dot in the sky after you trying to film (while talking to your neighbor) and then- I noticed around 1:24 or 1:25 into the film that you are looking downward at your device and your thumb is on the screne, at that point a black object passes between your thumb & head and it looks like the black dot taking off quickly. I wonder myself if that was what that was!? Awesome video capture! I am not a mufon investigator or professional, so I myself dont know what it was actually. I can say ive had some experiences myself before that have left me with no answers and only wondering. I wish you luck in finding out what it might have been:)"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.414011,+-71.381277(35661)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35661) map </A>","Summary":"To the Gentleman from TN- Object while filming Dogs- Black disc/sphere in sky","Log Number":"US-02122012-0020","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35661.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35661.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.414011","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"35661","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
