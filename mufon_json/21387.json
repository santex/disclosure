Witness and his wife obtained a video camera and binoculars and obtained about 7 minutes of video. The objects changed formation from a V to horizontal and their movement seemed smooth and intelligently controlled. One of the video frames shows an airliner on approach to DFW airport to the south along with one of the objects. The objects appeared farther than the airliner, therefore, they were at least several miles away. The objects appeared circular and shinny silver.
