The mines is not too far from Oak Hill. Just about 5 miles down Rt. 61. We had been there about an hour and a half. Just as we were packing up to leave Martha said, \"What's that?\" We looked up in the sky and saw a brillant white light falling from the sky towards the mountain next to the one we were on. We didn't have the slightest idea of what it was. Me and Mike grabbed the binoculars and started wathcing it. When it reached the top of the mountain, we thought it was going to land but there was no place to land that wasn't covered by trees. So, it started going around the mountain and I just don't mean around, it was going in and out of the trees as it was goin around. We just couldn't believe it. Nothing that we know of can go in and out of the trees. We never saw it again when it got to the bottom of the mountain on the side away from us. We stayed there waiting for it to reappear but it never did. On our way home we talked about it. What amazed us was the way it in and out of the trees. It didn't go over them it went in between them."],"Summary":"A ball of brillant white light fell from the sky.","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.445393","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.598686,+-80.445393(6455)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6455) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/31/1985 12:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/31/1985 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6455.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6455.html"],"Case Number":"6455","Country":"United States","Latitude":"38.598686"}
