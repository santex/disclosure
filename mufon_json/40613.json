She was driving and I was watching the skies. I always watch the sky. As we were getting close to Milton Ave., in Solvay, I noticed a weird shaped object just above the cumulus clouds. It was a disk shape and quite a distance away, approximately 2000~3000 feet high. I then told her to pull over in a parking lot. I had to get out of the car. I watched it flop back and forth while it descended and ascended higher and higher. It was like a roller coaster pattern. This thing had to be big! It was as big as an aspirin and dark in color. I did see a reflected area of the craft momentarily as it waffled back and forth. I watched this strange event for about 5 minutes as it disappeared out of my line of sight. My girlfriend did not see a thing. She thinks that I am crazy. This is not the first time for me. 2 years ago I had a close encounter (2) with 3 rectangle shapes just above the road from which I was traveling on. That was nuts and I was scared!"],"Object Features":"Dome","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Solvay","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07082012-0029","Object Shape":"Disc"}
