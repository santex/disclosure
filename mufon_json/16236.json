{"divs":["sighting detailsabout 9pm last night march 24, 2009 i was sitting on the back patio of our house petting the dog and watching the sky. we live almost under one of the main flight paths for san antonio airport. my patio faces approximately northwest. almost all of the air traffic is on a north\\south trajectory. you can clearly see all faa marking lights and landing lights as the aircraft are usually low in altitude. about 09:08pm a bright gold flash caught my eye to the west and i immediately focused my attention there. i saw a very bright sold gold orb moving from the west to east at a very fast pace. it had no tail and was very well defined. it did not fade in or out, but simply appeared for about a second and disappeared. i got up and moved towards the west side of my patio to make sure that a small tree had not obscured the view, but it was not there. in about thirty second another bright gold object appeared just below where i had seen the first one. this one had a bright tail behind it that appeared to be debris like a sparkler would give off. it too disappeared in about a second. i yelled at my wife that we might be having a comet show. after watching the sky for another 30 minutes and not seeing anything else unusual i thought more about it and since the sky was very overcast i began to doubt that the two object could have been shooting stars because of the overcast and the fact that they were on a flat trajectory and not descending. watching planes coming in for a landing i could see that their lights were somewhat diminished in brightness until they got lower and closer which would indicate that the cloud cover was fairly low. please see the attached picture that i took this morning to get an idea of the position on the horizon and the distance they covered. i would like to mention that i saw something similar back in about october 2008 but the gold object traveled along the western horizon just above and along the entire roof line of our house. it only took it about three second to do this. i didn���t think much of it at the time as the sun was just setting and the sky was clear. the one odd thing is that it appeared in a bright flash and then instantly got smaller before it went above the roof line. i just thought it was a shooting star as well. i am a long time ufo buff and i read your daily reports and look at the pictures. i am usually very skeptical of what most people would like to call a ufo. i would very much like to know if anyone else saw these objects above san antonio last night."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-03252009-0005","Tags":"City","City":"San Antonio","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There was one other sighting in San Antonio on or around March 24th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.432402,+-98.487528(16236)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16236) map </A>","Case Number":"16236","Latitude":"29.432402","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-98.487528","Date of the Event":"03/24/2009 09:08 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16236.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16236_submitter_file1__Sky03252009.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16236.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Gold orbs over San Antonio.","Date Submitted":"03/24/2009 09:08 UTC"}
