Sighted from the eastside of Indianapolis, Indiana. I was outside looking at the stars when I saw what at first glance I thought was a airplane. When I looked closer in relation to stars in the sky this object appeared to be further out than the stars. The object was on a south to north flight path and seemed to speed up and slow down and also weaved from side to side. The object kept on this path until it was completely out of view. There where also airplanes in the sky to reference from. I'm not saying this was a alien craft or anything like that just something not usually seen. I wanted to make this post to see if someone else saw anything similar or to maybe be able to explain to me what this is. Thank you for your interest."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There were no other sightings in Indianapolis on or around August 28th 2011"],"Date of the Event":"08/28/2011 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31263.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31263.html"],"Log Number":"US-08282011-0028","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Strange moving light very high in sky","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-85.969021","Date Submitted":"08/28/2011 11:43 UTC"}
