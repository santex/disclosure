{"divs":["sighting detailsi was doing my make up by the window, think i was getting ready for work. i was looking out the window at the clear blue sky then looked at the leaves of a tree in my garden and suddenly notice just next to the outline of the tree was a silver\\metalic looking triangle, perfectly still in the air, isosceles shaped, don't know how big it was as i couldn't tell how far away it was, perhaps a couple of millimeters in the sky from my eye line. i just stared at it for a while wondering what it could be, i was sort of holding my breath and heart beating fast with excitement as it was bizarre and i couldn't think of what it could be. after a while of staring at it i thought to myself, that there could be any number of explanations, there was no one else in the house to tell and i certainly didn't plan on telling people i was seeing things in the sky as i would sound like i was mentally ill. i looked away to continue getting ready, still thinking about it and when i looked up again it was gone, so i don't know if it disappeared or moved or was ever even really there."],"Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"","City":"Sale","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.416699,+-2.308544(20621)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20621) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/20/2009 08:00 UTC","Case Number":"20621","Date of the Event":"05/29/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sale","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"GB-11202009-0002","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United Kingdom","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"53.416699","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20621.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20621.html"],"Longitude":"-2.308544","Summary":"motionless silver isosceles triangle.","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
