This image was captured above the male newscaster as he was talking to his counterpart, a female newscaster dressed in red. the back ground on this telecast was of numerous buildings and some type of dome not sure if some where close to an airport. As I continued to watch the news, I did not observed any other object or plane in the area. I was somewhat startled as to how this object shot up into the sky from the ground. I rewound the image a couple of times in order to identify it but I could not, due to the speed. If you are able to retrieve the telecast, you might be able to identified this object better than me. What caught my attention was the fashion in which this abject ascended from the ground and into the sky. I would be interested in knowing your opinion in this matter. thank you."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39126.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39126.html"],"Log Number":"US-06102012-0016","Tags":"City","Summary":"Dark object","Longitude":"-119.414532","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"39126","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Region":"California"}
