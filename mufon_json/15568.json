{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI am babysitting the neibors dog, so i took the dog outside, the sun felt good, So i decided to lay down on the grass and watch the clouds go by, then thats when i noticed a small airplane doing tricks, it went out of view so I decided to go in the house and get a big ole beach towel to lay on just encase it would come by again, a few minuets went by and I saw a orange plane, the size of a cropduster, then I saw the silver ball sphere thing, and saw another orange plane, the sphere went behind the cloud, and the two planes went on diffrent sides of the cloud. like they were going to cut it off at the pass or something,I never saw the sphere come out of the clouds. and the planes went on! was very odd to me. the first thing i thought was, i think i just saw a ufo. thank you, Sonya"],"trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Longmont","There was one other sighting in Longmont on or around February 18th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15568.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15568_submitter_file1__waver003.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15568.html"],"Country":"United States","Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"15568","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.176837,+-105.094878(15568)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15568) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"40.176837","Date Submitted":"02/18/2009 11:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-105.094878","Log Number":"US-02182009-0005","Date of the Event":"02/18/2009 11:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","City":"Longmont","Summary":"It was silver, 2 airplanes looked like it was chasing it (crop duster size).","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00"}
