It went to a solid color, continued to make a big arc in the sky, slowed down then dissappeared into the darkness of the night. During it both my buddies and i were trying to think what it was, it was blinking then went to a solid color then dissappeared, We were saying that it was way to high to be a plane and way to fast and eratic to be a satilite. After it dissappeared i was chilled to the bone...i didnt know what to think, did we just see a UFO? WEll...we did and still to believe it was a ufo."],"Longitude":"-106.678619","Date of the Event":"07/06/2007 10:30 UTC","Case Number":"7395","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Summary":"Looked like a fast blinking satillite then it slowed down, made a big arc in the night sky, slowed down, then dissappeared","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Features":"Unknown"}
