These straight lines were not illuminated, solid, white,and stationary which looked like white curtain pull wands. I never saw solid (not blurred like jet lines) in the sky before this. I haven't a clue what this could have been. I was amazed but then lost sight a about 5 minutes earlier because I had to get off at exit 105. There was moderate traffic which I then tried to keep my eyes on the road and had no thought of reporting this, only to my boyfriend later that night, or getting out and taking a picture with my camera on my cell phone."],"Summary":"Saw cluster of star-like objects (planes) over 3 distinct lines in sky.","Latitude":"40.776488","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14236.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14236.html"],"City":"Plainview","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.776488,+-73.467345(14236)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14236) map </A>","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"14236","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-73.467345","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Plainview","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"None"}
