A rather large orange-red, very vibrant pulsating light was visible moving straight across in an airplane-fashion, about the same speed. We had limited visibility through bushes and pub-inventory, when we noticed that there were additional objects with the same appearance that floated farther away from the one we just spotted. At first glance it seemed like a helicopter, however the number of objects and the rather intense light and color would not have justified that conclusion. I went on to a better spot to examine these objects and a friend followed me. Surprisingly no one else of the few people we had made aware of the objects followed, after the incident they explained it was due to disbelief. We���re not sure how many of the guests in the pub had noticed them as well. We gained full sight of the sky, about 2 objects were flying to our left, with the rest in no particular formation to our right, in front of them. They were flying level, apparently with considerable distance between them (the first one we noticed was just glowing so much, seemed much closer), and at normal, aircraft-comparable speed. After watching them for some time and taking a photo via a cellphone, one after another began to disappear. The size of the glowing balls began to shrink, until there was only a very small but shiny star-like glow visible, then they disappeared completely, one after another. It did, to me, not seem like they were speeding away as it is common in ufo reports, but rather that the light got smaller until invisible (it did not dim out). We are examining the possibility of these objects being candle-balloons, however from our observation that does not seem to be a possibility due to a) the extremely bright orange-red color of the objects and b) the straight level flight of all of the objects (horizontal, not upwards)."],"Date Submitted":"07/17/2008 10:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"51.030511","Case Number":"11607","Longitude":"13.757218","Summary":"Glowing objects flying level and disappearing over Dresden, Germany spotted.","Country":"Germany","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.030511,+13.757218(11607)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11607) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere"}
