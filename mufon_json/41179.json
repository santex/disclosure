When I witnessed the UFO it was howering above in a southwest direction and was quite high up in the sky unlike the previous orbs I saw in December 2011. A neighbor came outside with her two dogs that were barking incessantly so I took my dogs inside to avoid them. When I returned a minute later I no longer saw the UFO."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41179.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41179.html"],"Log Number":"US-07272012-0011","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"07/25/2012 09:40 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.684502,+-121.145652(41179)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41179) map </A>","Summary":"It had flashing lights and at first I thought it may be an airplane but when I watched for several minutes I realized it was not an airplane.","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-121.145652","Case Number":"41179","Date Submitted":"07/27/2012 12:53 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
