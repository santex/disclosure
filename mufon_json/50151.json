After about 3 minutes, the orange lights faded quickly very near to us as we jumped in the car to give chase, one remaining object was seen moving still in the same direction, but without the orange light, and possibly a reflected off white light. That was the last we saw of them that night. We have poor quality video and pictures. The ramp lights obscured the dark backdrop."],"Log Number":"US-08252013-0016","Case Number":"50151","Summary":"My girlfriend and I were turning westbound on the bypass 4 129 on ramp when we promply saw 6 round glowing orange lights in what appeared to be two triangular shaped patterns moving together in a northeast heading.","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Hamilton","There were no other sightings in Hamilton on or around August 24th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.40618","Date of the Event":"08/24/2013 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/25/2013 12:17 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50151.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50151.html"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Ohio","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.40618,+-84.593436(50151)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50151) map </A>","City":"Hamilton"}
