We watched it for about 5 minutes before it went out of view. At first we all thought it was strange. It was coming from the De Leon area and heading towards Stephenville. We watched in amazement for a couple of minutes, Then I decided to grab my binoculars and look at it. That is when we realized it was a Triangle shaped craft. You could clearly see it through the binoculars. The strobe it had was different than anything I've seen. The lights appeared to be white in color with the occasional hint of red. This was our friends first legit sighting. The lights appeared to be fluttering or vibrating maybe. We left our original spot and drove across the field to get a better view. We all watched as it slowly disappeared. It was definately not something you would see in the sky."],"Longitude":"-98.371002","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Lighted Triangle object with strange strobing lights.","Date of the Event":"06/09/2012 11:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"06/10/2012 07:13 UTC","City":"Dublin","Latitude":"32.139538","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.139538,+-98.371002(39137)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39137) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39137.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39137.html"],"Log Number":"US-06102012-0028","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
