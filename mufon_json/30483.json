I WENT AND GOT MY TELESCOPE AND BINOCULARS AND WENT TO MY BACK YARD. ALMOST EVERYDAY I HAVE SEEN STARLIKE LIGHTS THAT ALL OF SUDDEN START MOVING FROM SIDE TO ANOTHER AND JUST DISAPPEAR. THIS HAPPENS ABOUT 3-4 DIFFERENT TIMES SAME NIGHT. ITS LOOKS LIKE A STAR MOVING. I ALWAYS CALL MY SON AND WIFE TO SEE THEM. THEY SEE THE LIGHTS BUT THEY SAY ITS A PLAIN OR MY SON SAYS THEY ARE SATELLITES. I DONT HAVE ANY PICTURES OR VIDEO CAUSE THEY ARE TOO SMALL TO CAPTURE."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.180095,+-117.11873(30483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30483) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30483.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/15/2011 12:00 UTC","City":"San Marcos","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"N/A","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in San Marcos","There were no other sightings in San Marcos on or around July 15th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"08/07/2011 04:05 UTC","Latitude":"33.180095","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","Summary":"STARLIKE AND FIREBALLS"}
