In direct line with my front door. The light beam was shining into my house and no light from the beam was on the lawn. Watched the object for 15-20 minutes then rose straight up into the air.no noise but it created wind. On the 20th of August it appeared in the sky but much further away. Several nights later it appeared again and then we saw it again this evening. This evening over the 30 minute period the object slowly decended in the sky until it was below the treetops. While I do not feel afraid I am perplexed as to what the bright light is. We live in a rural area and under a flight path of planes to and from BWI and it is not a plane."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.831782,+-76.611351(25342)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25342) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09082010-0006","Date of the Event":"09/08/2010 08:28 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/08/2010 08:39 UTC"}
