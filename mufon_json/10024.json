I was the passenger in the car we were driving about 60 mph. I thought a real fast car was passing us because there was no other cars. This is a road where people do drive fast but as I looked back the object was not on the road it quickly cam along side of us flying above the ground about 50 feat. It was on the drivers side but it was so bright but did not hurt my eyes. After a few seconds it whet up in the sky. Then I see on TV they saw something in Texas. I had a doctors appointment and can get the exact date.
