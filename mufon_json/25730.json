{"Summary":"burst of light that was oval shaped then ended with a shooting star tail","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking my dogs out in my backyard then I look up at the sky and this light blue flare, or flash appears in the sky and spreads into an oval and like a firework it burst out but just disappear's then it ends with a shooting star like tail. again to be more specific it was an oval shaped flare that was all blue no spaces then disappeared and ended with a shooting star-like tail. I thought this object was a U.F.O but then I thought it was a shooting star, but shooting stars don't flare at the beginning of they're appearance. when it was active the U.F.O was going down, I also noticed that it was SECONDS before the sun came up. my feeling's were going crazy, I was scared, nervous, and excited I went inside to tell my mom and I told her and she was in shock too. I finally faced my fears then went back out-side to feed my dog's (they had no reaction to this event.) I stayed out there to see if I see anything else, but the results I didn't see anything else in the sky."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/07/2010 10:56 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25730","Object Shape":"Oval","Country":"United States","Latitude":"30.276453","Sighting Duration":"07:05:10","Date of the Event":"10/07/2010 07:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10072010-0013","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.276453,+-97.737961(25730)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25730) map </A>","City":"Austin","Longitude":"-97.737961","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25730.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25730.html"],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There was one other sighting in Austin on or around October 7th 2010"]}
