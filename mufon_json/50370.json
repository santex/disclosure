They were at airplane level, but were very unsteady in their flight. These orbs showed one at a time, after one orb headed west and lights shut off, the outline of the object was still slightly visible. Then it disappeared. Then another would appear to ascend from the south and do the same thing in a slightly different travel pattern, still pulsating and dimming and changing in direction. As if it was \"wiggling\" it's way across the sky. They weren't flares nor were they any sort of firework. There was also no accompaning sounds or sounds as they dissapeared."],"Case Number":"50370","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-99.897803","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"31.975129","Log Number":"US-09022013-0014","Summary":"Red orbs ascending then dissapearing","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.975129,+-99.897803(50370)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50370) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/01/2013 09:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/02/2013 01:24 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle"}
