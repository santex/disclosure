They seemed very restless and upon investigating did not see anything at that time (12:30 AM) and went back into his house for more sleep. Location: Monroe, Oregon, about 12 miles north of Eugene, Oregon along highway 99 W. At 2:00 AM cows and dogs ���were making one hell of a racket.��� The farmer went to the back door and upon opening it is astounded to see a very large 80 feet in length x 40 feet wide, 20 feet high craft with flat underside and domed top with a row of brightly lit windows, or circular ports around the lower portion of the craft. The object was hovering above the cow shed and surrounding fence. The farmer watched for about 30 minutes then the craft glowing more intently began to rise silently, then ���streaked upward��� into the dark, starlit sky. The farmer was joined at the last few minutes by a pick-up driver who had wondered what was going on over at the farm when he saw the lights from the highway. Upon approaching the farmer���s driveway realized the lights were a kind of craft. The farmer has a good reputation locally. At 8:00 AM, the farmer and the driver (who later rejoined the farmer), first called then visited the sheriff to report the incident, but who at first ridiculed both until the farmer became adamant and then the sheriff took down the report. [This then was forwarded to the Eugene Register Guard]."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.058049,+-123.081914(7813)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7813) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09022007-0009","City":"Eugene","Country":"United States","Latitude":"44.058049","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Case Number":"7813","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Eugene","There were no other sightings in Eugene on or around July 15th 1976"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7813.html"],"Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Date Submitted":"07/15/1976 12:30 UTC","Summary":"A farmer was awakened about 12:30 am by the ruckus his cows and dogs were making and upon investigating is astounded to see an 80 x40 feet ,20 ft high craft with flat underside","Object Shape":"Oval"}
