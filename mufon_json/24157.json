While waiting, My eyes were on the sky I watched my neighbors shoot off fireworks. I saw what I thought to be a burning ember in the sky. Upon closer inspection, I noticed this object was not falling; it was moving in a horizontal line, at great speed from Southeast to Northwest. The object was a bright orange light, large and oval in shape, and made no sound. The light appeared to dim and brighten several times as it moved through the sky. While observing this object, I mentioned my sighting to the person I was talking to on the phone, and he confirmed that it was the same thing he was observing 70 miles Northwest of my location. Eventually I lost sight of it as the light suddenly disappeared."],"Longitude":"-94.397168","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"24157","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
