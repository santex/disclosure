I woke at about 5 am with what seemed to be this dream. But it sure seemed like it just happened. I wrote it down right then and drew the sketches of what I saw. It started when I found myself outside and as I looked ahead of me I saw a small very bright light then all of a sudden a very bright flash. When I turned around there were 3 small grey beings standing there. I wasn't afraid (I don't know why). They then told me (telepathically I think) that they needed help (I don���t remember for what) and asked me to help them. I agreed. Then I looked up and saw a huge craft hovering near us then I saw a second one about 400 ft away from the \"main\" one (it looked the same). The next think I remember is looking up at the night sky and it was like someone just pulled the sky apart and there was an opening maybe 200ft across. I could see blue sky and clouds in the opening and a humming sound (I didn't hear anything while under the Craft earlier). I looked to the left of me and there were two other people stand near me looking up as well. I never saw these people before and none of us seemed to be able to talk or move much (it was like we were all just becoming ���un-paralyzed��� or something). There wasn���t a sound or a breath of air moving. There was some light at ground level that illuminated everything but I couldn't turn to see what or where it was. Then all of a sudden the small gray beings were gone and then the first ship flew in to the opening in the blink of an eye and the second one followed right behind. The sky closed. That's all I remember until I woke up (or got back). Now the really weird part is my 8 year old daughter was sleeping on the floor because as I later found out she couldn't sleep in her room. Later this morning when I was talking to my wife on the phone and before I told her anything about what I saw she said the our daughter had woken her up in the middle of the night (3:30) and saw a lot of very bright flashing lights outside of our upper (roof) dormer window. When I ask her about them before she went to school she said that she though there were about 11 of them. She closed her eyes and said when she opened them a little while later they had stopped. I guess that���s what got me thinking, did I really have a dream or did something really happen? Updated: Since I wrote that at five in the morning on Friday Sept. 5th 2008 and now 3 days later it���s still all I can think about. I have been having headaches since this happened and seem to be very moody. When I was out mowing the mower stopped and as I got off I looked up and I had a ���flash back��� of that being the exact spot where we were all standing looking up at these two craft (we live out in the country and have a lot of area). Again the longer it���s been the more I feel this really happened."],"Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-86.006111","Tags":"City","Case Number":"12388","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hamilton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-09082008-0004","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/05/2008 05:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Hamilton","Summary":"2 craft - 3 aliens."}
