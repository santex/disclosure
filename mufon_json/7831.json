I have worked in the avionics, satellite, and telecommunication industries. At the time of this sighting, I was working a contract in upstate New York. My legal address is in Reno, NV. My son, who lives in NV, was getting married that weekend. I had reserved a hotel room for my daughter, who lived in Florida, at the Hilton in Reno. Due to a hurricane, my daughter could not make the wedding. I decided to use the hotel room for myself since it was not refundable. I had decided that this would make an excellent vantage point for my video of the area which is why I initially made a reservation at that hotel. I am a MUFON field investigator. I was in the process of investigating an older report from the Reno area. The only contact that I had with the witness was through emails. I was having a difficult time getting the witness to provide detailed information in regards to their exact location within Reno and dates that these events occurred. Since I was in Reno for the wedding, I decided to video the area for later analysis should I get to that point in the investigation. As a result of working in New York, a 3 hour time difference, I was awake early in the morning at the Hilton in Reno. I decided that since most of the other people who were there for the wedding were probably still asleep, I would use the time to video the areas mentioned in the MUFON report. I started to video at 6:40 am. As luck would have it, I noticed a care flight arriving at the Washoe medical center. I filmed the helicopter landing at the medical center. These helicopters are dark blue in color and could possible be what the witness described as black helicopters hovering at night while they were waiting to land at the hospital. I decided to leave the hotel to film the helicopter at the hospital and then the rest of the areas described by the witness. I believe this only took about 1.0 ��� 1.5 hours in length to complete. Reno is a small town with mountains around it. Approximately, 8:15-9:30 am, I was back in my hotel room. I had put my video camera in a carrying bag on my bed, which did not make it easily accessible. I was looking out the hotel window, from the 9th floor of the hotel, down towards the medical center. The distance is just at 1.0 miles away. I was not looking at anything specific. I was trying to determine if there was anything else I could film to help in my investigation. At that point, I noticed some unusual motion. There were cars on the streets but this was unexpected. It was up at tree top level. As I focused on the object, I was trying to determine what I was seeing. The object was perfectly spherical in shape. The object was below me at tree top level. It was just my side of the medical center, around 1 mile, at most, in distance. I compared the size of the object to the cars on the street. I would estimate the object to be 2-4 feet in diameter. I tried to determine the color. What I noticed was that it seemed to bend light rays around it or that would be my best guess as to what it was doing. The sun was directly behind me at this time of day. Between me and the object was a few low rise buildings and the express way. There were trees behind the object. The object reflected what was behind it, the leaves of the trees in this case, not, what was in front of it. The reflection was not a solid color, but the different colors within the leaves of a tree as if looking directly at the trees. I was not seeing through the object since the trees in the background did not match exactly at the edge of the object. However, as the object moved, from north to south at almost, if not exactly, the same altitude, I noticed that the color of the object would change the same if I was scanning across the trees, with my eyes, and would noticed the different shades of color within the leaves of the trees. This only lasted about 10-15 seconds when my view of the object was blocked by the wing of the hotel. I was trying to logically determine what I had seen. My first instinct was to explain it as a balloon. That would be the quickest and easiest explanation. I had wedding guest to worry about and put this in the back of my mind for later analysis. In May of the next year, I was back in Fallon, NV. A friend of the family was graduating from high school. The high school had an outdoor graduation ceremony. During the ceremony, a couple of the students released balloons, one at a time, to indicate something they were talking about. My mind was concentrating on the balloons. As I watched, I noticed the shape, an upside down tear drop, and the flight path which was a sharp angular ascent into the air. I thought back on what I had witnessed and knew that that the object was not a balloon as I had dismissed it earlier. Spherical did not equal an upside down tear drop. A sharp angular ascent did not match a horizontal flight path. Even the metallic looking balloon did not reflect what was behind it. I keep thinking this might be some type of new military project that would be disclosed within a few years. I have read internet articles about scientist are working on potentially being able to bend light rays around an object. But I still have not read anything that would indicate that there is a working model or perhaps the object that I witnessed was the working prototype. Since the object was spherical in shape, I wondered what type of propulsion system and antigravity system it was using. I still have not been able to rationally explain that part of it. I have delayed reporting this for a variety of reasons. The main reason, which I will admit, is making time to fill out the short report. I guess it has been on my mind for a while that I thought by reporting it now I could let it slip away from my thoughts. Another reason had to do with the report that I was investigating. The reporting party had indicated that some of the objects they had witnessed were around the down town buildings and the reporting party were the only ones who could see them. They also indicated that they had searched the internet to find articles on UFO���s, etc. I did not want them to latch on to what I had witnessed as part of their story. Although, bending lights rays around the object could explain why they could see them and no one else seemed to have noticed them. With all of the lights at the casinos down town, and people hustling about, people may not have noticed the object(s). The last reason is one of national security. I work as an engineer. I have signed non-disclosure agreements with many of the companies where I have worked. While I have never worked on this type of project and therefore have never agreed to not disclose such information, I felt that if our government was working on such a project, it might be wise to not report the sighting for a while. Since a few years have elapsed, they should have had enough time to complete the project. So, by making it know at this point, I would hope it would not cause an issue, if indeed our government is working on such a project. In hind site, I should have taken time to sit down to record the exact time, details, etc. of the sighting. Without having my video camera at arms length, I knew it was just another story of a sighting without evidence. I did review the video that I had shot earlier to see if I could find the object within it. Perhaps it is there but I did not notice it."]}
