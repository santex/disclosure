I noticed a star that seemed to be blinking in the northwest sky and then 3 roundlooking objects flew by, they did not have any lights or anything to make them noticable. The first object was followed by the other 2 and they seemed to be moving around one another. They were going too fast to be conventional aircraft! They were flying from north to south over the city of Victoria Texas. I tried to yell at my wife to come outside but she didn't hear me when I told her my story she laughed. This is the first time I've seen something like this. This sighting reminded me of the one they had in Mexico that was reported by the military that's how fast these objects were moving approx. I watched them for a few seconds the trees blocked any further viewing! I did not bother to call the authorities because they'd laugh at me!"],"Longitude":"-96.995908","Summary":"Was looking at a star when all of a sudden 3 objects flew by!","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05262009-0022","Case Number":"17179","Source":"MUFON"}
