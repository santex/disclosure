I dismissed it as a star, but it has been dissapearing in between his smoke breaks he takes outside. So. Went outside t see it, and it was in the western part of the sky, under the clouds, just sitting there. We waited and it just disappeared after about 30 mins. Could not believe it. Planes do not hover and stars do not dissapear. It was about 4 times the size of a star and very bright white. Just round. Hovered perfectly. We saw planes after that in the opposite direction after it was gone and it was definitely not a plane! We will keep our eyes open cause it has been coming back!"],"trends":["There have been 96 other sightings in Wilmington","There was one other sighting in Wilmington on or around November 19th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-11192013-0018","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
