Over the mountains about a mile to the north a dark large object with dim lights silhouetting its shape started moving towards me, it must have been a few thousand feet up in the sky. It made absolutely no noise and was very large , maybe 250ft long and 100 ft wide (just a guess). It moved from the mountains traveling south to just over my head and started to hover, it then rotated and pointed east. Like a flash it disappeared at increadible speed, making no noise, into the eastern horizon ."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.398884,+-119.518456(21042)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21042) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City"}
