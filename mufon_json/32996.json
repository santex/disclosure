After a little he told me a of a time he swears that he was either abducted or just messed with by aliens. His story goes \"so I was on my couch in the livingvroom watching tv relaxin. I start to dose off and fall asleep, then bam. I wake up and my bodys shaking like I'm having a seizure. I couldn't feel anything I couldn't make a sound. I look up through my kitchen and see two very tall probably 8 9 feet, and very thin entities, standing straight up at my back sliding glass door. A bright white light over them as they just stood and starred. The light started to get brighter then all I remember is waking up on my couch.\" I questioned him saying it coulda been a dream just seemed real. He swore there was no way, it was verry verry real and is convinced it happened."],"trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around January 15th 2011"],"Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"10/31/2011 06:35 UTC","Log Number":"US-10312011-0019","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"33.449557","Longitude":"-112.072357","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","City":"Phoenix","Summary":"Friend wakes up shaking then sees very dark entity","Case Number":"32996","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/15/2011 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.449557,+-112.072357(32996)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32996) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32996.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32996.html"]}
