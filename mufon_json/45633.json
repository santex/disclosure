The object was very bright and never blinked or wavered in intensity.After approximately a couple minutes the object appeared to dim and then suddenly disappeared completely.I continued to observe the sky for several minutes afterward and the object never reappeared."],"Region":"Michigan","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-84.545607"}
