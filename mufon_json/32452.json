{"Summary":"I observed a star-like object in the morning sky. It moved one direction then changed; direction instantly. It moved very fast across the sky.","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I observed a star-like object in the morning sky at approximately 9:10 AM, Oct 8, 2011. It moved one direction then abruptly changed direction several time before instantly coming to a complete stop where it appeared to hover. The object did this several times. It was very high in the sky (approx. 60 degree off the horizon) and was bright like a star. It then moved very quickly across the sky and came to a complete stop where it again hovered. After it hovered for a few seconds, it disappeared. As an estimation of the speed of the object, we saw a high flying commercial airplane a few minutes after seeing the object. We estimated that the object was traveling 4-5 times faster than the commercial airplane."],"Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"10/08/2011 09:10 UTC","Case Number":"32452","City":"Tustin","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.731243,+-117.80347(32452)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32452) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10082011-0010","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Tustin","There were no other sightings in Tustin on or around October 8th 2011"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/08/2011 01:09 UTC","Latitude":"33.731243","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.80347","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32452.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32452.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
