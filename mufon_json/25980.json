I was sitting in the passenger seat. The road was very dark during this time. My girlfriend was complaining so I put on my headphones. I seen a bright circular object appear halfway in the sky then fell at an angle towards the earth as we approached Dixie HWY and I -75 in the wooded area. It fell Southwest of our current location. I sat there for a moment and thought to my self for about 3-4 minutes. So I took my headphones off and ask my girlfriend did she see that? She said \" thing thing that fell from the sky\". I was like yeah. SO we both had seen it. I had to make sure my eyes weren't only playing a trick on me.Thats when I told her it must of been a UFO. I told her that there has been alot of sightings lately like in New York and Texas. I felt weird after seeing that."],"Case Number":"25980","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-83.683136","Region":"Michigan","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25980.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25980.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/19/2010 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-10192010-0011","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/19/2010 05:41 UTC","Summary":"Fell at at angle towards towards the earth.","City":"Flint","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Flint","There were no other sightings in Flint on or around October 19th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.019037,+-83.683136(25980)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25980) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
