Proceeded down 36th Avenue Harmont Drive To Northern Avenue Turned right onto Northern Heading towards 75th Avenue and Northern. Right around 56th Avenue and Northern Glendale, AZ 85301 Sometime between 7:15 and 7:30PM Arizona time I looked out of my drivers side window and noticed a triangle shaped craft, flying at fairly low, much lower than I have seen planes normally fly. It had two bright white lights positioned at each end of the backend and what looked like a red flashing light between them near the bottom of the craft. By time I told my girlfriend to look, it was to far away to make out any detail but you could still see the lights on the back. So it was moving fairly fast but at a steady speed no darting or \"jumping.\" I am not sure exactly what it was, just want to see if anyone has seen anything like it."],"Latitude":"33.659487","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"03/17/2011 07:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-03182011-0002","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/18/2011 11:46 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28269.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28269.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
