craft(circular or disked shaped, tough to say exactly) with flashes of red and green light on occasion, strong white glow seemed to periodically strobe around object similar to lighthouse effect but no stream of light was projected. i woke up and noticed this craft perhaps military. it seemed maybe a few miles away just over this mountaintop by my house. in that three hours it was moving in slow methodical cross or x formations bobbing up and down side to side in a way. but moved only a short distance from it's initial starting point in the three hours i watched it before falling back asleep. i started to believe it might be a high tech secret weather baloon being tested and the bobbing motions were from wind currents. i noticed it three days later at 4am when i woke, more movement, diagonal deliberate, with still the cross bobbing. same patterns moving slowly higher into the atmosphere. this time i started to notice smaller white lights shooting out of it. i saw it again a couple days latter, and even saw a roundish disc shaped silver object with dark spots on the side(windows light both???)that afternoon which i convinced myself was connected to previous phenomena because it appeared the central part was circulating. i could see the dark spots(windows, lights) rotating around the main structure of the craft. this was heading southward from carlsbad two miles inland. people definately saw this thing. then a week later there were four straight mornings i woke up and saw this thing. never before three o'clock(the witching hour) but sometimes i'd wake up at 4am and it wasn't there but at 4:30am i'd reawake at there it was. i have no ac in my bedroom and i wake up constantly. i've always just watched from the bedroom window but the third night i went downstairs and outside. when i did at 4:47 i remember seeing two other objects. here is the thing. i live close by palomar airport so small planes are always around and at night a plane looks like a white glow with red and green small flashes on the wings and tail. you see hundreds and they are like background noise or a fan eventually you don't notice they're there. as soon as i walked outside i noticed in my mind's eye a lowflying plane white glow red\\green flashing lights which was close enough that i could hear it but i'm fixated on this large ufo just over the mountain top. in that next minute another regular plane caught my eye and i thought to myself they have to see this thing. then i notice the plane isn't moving at all but it is bobbing in a cross like motion. then that first lowflying plane that went past my house has turned around and i'm thinking the pilot saw it\\them and is checking it out. then all the hair on my neck and body are standing up the plane that turned around just stopped and i see these three craft one large two small in a triangle\\pyramid formation bobbing ever so slowly in that x, cross formation. i've seen dozens of ufo sitings in my life and i've never officially reported any of them. the craziest one was a blueish green glowing pyramid about a foot tall that landed in my front yard in upstate new york which was there for a good hour before i could gather the courage to investigate it. i was 7 years old and remember standing next to it but i wouldn't touch it then i woke up in my bed. i didn't tell a soul for ten years. i even blacked it out from my memory for awhile. what was so amazing about this recent event to me was how this craft the small one for all intents and purposes was cloaked so to speak as regular plane flying at night with visual and audial stimuli in lights and engine sound. then all of a sudden it broke cover was silent and started moving in the above mentioned formation. whether us military, nazi, alien, other ancient earth species whatever whoevers technology, i witnessed a different type of cloaking device. i know there are some who would say that's stupid why wouldn't they just become invisible and silent and truely be cloaked. i don't have a definative answer for that but i do know what i saw and i wasn't drinking and i don't use drugs. perhaps whoever it is it's a matter of efficiency in money or energy. like a shape shifter this craft perhaps can become completely invisible and silent but found it more efficient in the dark of morning to appear and sound like a traditional plane for awhile before shifting gears so to speak. as the saying goes,\"why is a soap bubble round.\" so this story is less about looking for strange lights in the sky and more about paying closer attention to all those commonly seen aircraft. you never know."],"trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Carlsbad","There were no other sightings in Carlsbad on or around June
