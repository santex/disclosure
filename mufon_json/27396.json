There were plenty of airplanes flying by with their loud engines and blinking lights. Then I spotted one bright white light floating from the left side of the sky, then to the right. It was going the same speed as the airplanes, maybe to blend in. I don't think it made a sound. All the planes had passed and if you could hear them it was very faint. As close as this object was it should have been louder. I stopped and stared as it slowly floated along. Then it went from white to red and disappeared. Almost like someone turned the light off. It was not an airplane!"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/14/2011 09:09 UTC","Summary":"Non-blinking, star-like object flying past","Latitude":"32.804255","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around January 11th 2011"],"Case Number":"27396","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27396.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27396.html"],"Longitude":"-96.765343","Disposition":"IFO"}
