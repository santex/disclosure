{"Summary":"dont know what it was but i have the pic see below","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was Saturday, Feb 20, 2010 about 12 noon when my friend and I were out mining in the area of Randsburg, California. I was driving down the road and I looked to my left and saw what I thought at first was a helicopter. It was silver and blue and it was traveling along the bottom of the mountain right to left. My friend and I both thought it was working around a mineshaft. We pulled over because something didn���t look right. At closer inspection it looked like three blocks one silver on top, and two blue on the bottom and about the size of a car. I definitely no longer thought it was a helicopter. The wind was blowing about 30 mph from our left to right. We got the camera and took some pictures of the object. The object then made a right turn and went diagonal up the mountain from left to right and when it got to the top of the mountain it went straight up and disappeared . It was hard to believe we saw something do what it did. We talked about this on our way home and we remembered that we saw a fighter jet the day before flying around, although we don't know if that is significant or not."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Randsburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"02/20/2010 12:00 UTC","City":"Randsburg","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22057.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22057.html"],"Log Number":"US-02282010-0027","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Region":"California","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.658116","Latitude":"35.368574","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"22057","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/28/2010 06:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.368574,+-117.658116(22057)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22057) map </A>"}
