I noticed this large, very bright round object hovering above some homes in the west, southwest sky. The object looked miles away, but was large in size. I watched it for about 3 minutes. It did not move. I went inside to get my video camera and began filming the object. after about 25 seconds of filming, the object started moving rapidly to the southwest and within seconds disappeared. At first, the object looked like a very bright star, but was to large to be a star. I really don't know what it was, but it did resemble any aircraft I have seen and the way it just took off and vanished, well, we may never know."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.634905,+-89.396358(20832)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20832) map </A>","Case Number":"20832","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Very Bright round and big","Region":"Illinois"}
