I am always outside observing the stars in the evening; I noticed lights blinking in the sky and the object unmoving. At first observance I thought it may be a helicopter or airplane. When I continued to watch it and had my wife come out with my binoculars we noticed that it remained stationary. We continued to watch the object and called several friends on the cell phone and they also observed the object and kept watching it even as the clouds covered it in our area. The object has a white background with a line of four red lights in the center with 4 additional red lights above and trailing. The total observation time for us was approximatey 45 minutes to an hour. At that time our friends continued to observe it as the clouds came in our area."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32064.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32064.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Wisconsin"}
