I do not believe the UFO to have been any sort of craft, terrestrial or otherwise, though Freddy is near a military base (CFB Gagetown) so who knows. We were walking the gravel trails along the Saint John River at night, headed west, perhaps slightly northwest. I had seen a shooting star earlier that night directly above us. This was probably a latecomer amongst the Perseids from August. Then, ahead of us and at a seemingly low altitude, and pretty close distance-wise as well, a bright green fireball entered and left our field of vision in about 3-5 seconds. It was moving quite quickly and of a distinctly spherical shape. Whatever it was, it was certainly not a \"normal\" denizen of the night sky, esp. over harsh city lights. My Paint sketch depicts the view from southside Freddy along the trail, with a bridge across the river, dotted with cars, in the foreground and the northside, dotted with lights, in the background. The UFO is in the sky and the red arrow indicates its route over about 3-5 seconds."],"Summary":"Meteor-like green UFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/01/2007 11:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Fredericton","Latitude":"45.97026","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.97026,+-66.641805(8342)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8342) map </A>","Country":"Canada"}
