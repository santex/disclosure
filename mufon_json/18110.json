The light then went south with 3 jets following behind it, they appeared to be chasing the light. I would estimate the light being 300 feet in the air. Being aware of a previous incident that was reported on Mufon from this area, I have been watching the sky at night and noticed a light like this moving way to fast to be a star and too low to the ground to be a satellite on several occasions, but never had it shine a light on us before. I have seen a light like this stop and turn at a 90 degree angle then speed across the sky on several occassions. There have been a lot of jets and airplanes late at night, which I've not noticed before."],"City":"Buffalo","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"07/08/2009 10:40 UTC","Latitude":"36.841257","Country":"United States","Region":"Oklahoma","Summary":"Star like light low to ground, stopped shined a light down on us","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.841257,+-99.624467(18110)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18110) map </A>","Longitude":"-99.624467","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Buffalo","There were no other sightings in Buffalo on or around July 8th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"07/08/2009 10:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"18110","Log Number":"US-07162009-0002"}
