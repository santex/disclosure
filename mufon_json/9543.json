{"Date Submitted":"02/11/2008 06:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was laying on my living room sofa at 6:30 p.m. when an extremely super brilliant glowing neon red sphere shaped object caught my attention through my living room window. I told my wife to look at it also. I first thought it was an airplane on fire. It was so bright, it was lighting up the sky around it. It moved horizontaly in a straight line from the direction of Lake Erie, in Euclid, Ohio, southbound about a miles distance towards Rt.90 at a slow rate about 500 feet above the houses. It then seemed to lose a bit of altitude when it just vanished. It wasn't very large but the light it emmitted was something else. My wife and myself said to each other that it was the brightest red color that we have ever seen. Total time seen was about one minute."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"41.593105","Object Features":"None","Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Case Number":"9543","Date of the Event":"02/11/2008 06:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Euclid","There were no other sightings in Euclid on or around February 11th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Extremely bright neon red light slowly moving across the sky.","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-81.526787","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.593105,+-81.526787(9543)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9543) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9543.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9543.html"],"Log Number":"US-02112008-0012","Source":"MUFON","City":"Euclid"}
