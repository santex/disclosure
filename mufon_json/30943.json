{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 9.30 in the evening I went out on my deck which faces north and east to call my cat in for the night. It was raining all day and now it was just drizzling lightly. Cloud cover was heavy with no stars or moon to be seen. A round orange ball caught my eye it was very bright and distinct first I thought maybe a search light but it was bright orange and continued on a north to south straight path and it was traveling faster than a plane and I could see no landing lights or any lights. I followed it visually then lost it when it went behind large trees. I then ran to my bedroom which faces southwest but could not see it. I call'ed my daughter right away and told her. I thought of getting my neighbor or camera but there was not time I did not want to loose sight of it. I was very excited in a good way and of course I am still thinking about it."],"Latitude":"41.286175","Summary":"orange glowing orb went past my house","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in New Haven","There were no other sightings in New Haven on or around August 15th 2011"],"Date of the Event":"08/15/2011 09:30 UTC","Region":"Connecticut","Longitude":"-72.888268","City":"New Haven","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Case Number":"30943","Weather Factors":"Fog, Rain","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30943.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30943.html"],"Log Number":"US-08162011-0009","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.286175,+-72.888268(30943)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30943) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Date Submitted":"08/16/2011 07:59 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
