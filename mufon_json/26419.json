My attention was drawn right away because I love to look at the stars and this was strange. They were very far away, it was a strain to watch them but it was neat in a scary sort of way. They would make circles, zig zag, blink out, and then blink back on. At one point it appeared other lights came, but they then disappeared. Five lights throughout and three seemed to join in and then disappear. We watched them for some time and then checked and found them again when we reached our destination. They were very coordinated in their actions."],"Date of the Event":"11/06/2010 10:20 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Wapakoneta","There were no other sightings in Wapakoneta on or around November 6th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Longitude":"-84.193559","Log Number":"US-11072010-0014"}
