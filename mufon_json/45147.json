He saw a few meteors streaking by, but one caught his eye. The object moved from the high east, 80 degrees elevation, was streaking towards the north and down. As it came down it stopped, did a loop and went back in the direction it came from but without a streak. It was too far away for physical details and only lasted a few seconds but it was shocking.
