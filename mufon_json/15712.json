As I was looking at this craft I noticed that it was silent and moved at an alarming rate and it did not feel earthly to me whatsoever something was very odd about it, it looked like a black mass but in a triangle and with lights and my friend saw it to because I was immediately tapping him quite hard and telling him to look up, he is still trying to figure out what it was...weather was cold but nice and clear, at least from where I was I could not see any clouds and this thing just disappeared, now it could be secret military craft but it did NOT feel earthly to me."],"Case Number":"15712","Log Number":"US-02252009-0002","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/24/2009 07:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/24/2009 07:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around February 24th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Triangle object flies overhead.","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.896172,+-77.032156(15712)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15712) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-77.032156","City":"Washington","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.896172"}
