It seemed too large to be a plane and it was only moving slightly but not going anywhere. I noticed that 15 minutes had passed and it was still there. It appeared to have metallic reflection as it caught some light. I tried several pair of eyeglasses to get the best view. I saw it through tree branches however it was maybe only the size of a BB. My first thought was, \"what the heck is that?\" I stared at it for about an hour, when it eventually it got higher in the sky and moved further away to about the size of a star. However hardly any other stars were noticeable by that time as it was getting to be daylight. So it appeared to move away from me going ESE."],"Date Submitted":"02/04/2006 06:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"4376","Country":"United States","Latitude":"38.137451","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4376.html"],"Summary":"Something too large for plane hung in sky for an hour before and at dawn then moved away","Longitude":"-93.169192","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.137451,+-93.169192(4376)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4376) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Edwards","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
