Upon exiting my parked car, I noticed some neighbors looking up at the sky. I followed their glance and saw the formation of 4 objects in the eastern sky above San Francisco. The objects flew across the sky, in formation, quite quickly in multiple directions with rapid turns. They hovered at times, then quickly flew around again. Mainly in formation, but a least least one object broke off, then later rejoined the formation. This happened multiple times. After a few minutes, the objects started to reduce in light intensity, then finally disappeared."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44484.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44484.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/25/2012 10:00 UTC","Summary":"Light formation hovering over San Francisco North Beach/Bay","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Triangle","Latitude":"37.78073","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.78073,+-122.413316(44484)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44484) map </A>"}
