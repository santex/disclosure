I called to my daughter to come out and look. We watched the two star like objects then we noticed what seemed to be a jet which came from the north also, heading after them. We also noticed another plane coming from the south heading toward the two star like lights. As the planes neared the star like lights, the star like lights just disappeared. It was like someone had flipped a switch, one second the two lights were there, then their lights were gone. The planes kind of circled where the lights had been, then the planes continued heading south. My daughter had tryed to take a picture of the star like lights but was unable to."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wolcott","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"08/19/2007 09:15 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.575556,+-72.475556(7717)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7717) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/19/2007 09:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7717.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7717.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Two unknown objects in the sky over Wocott, Vermont, with two planes","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.475556","Case Number":"7717"}
