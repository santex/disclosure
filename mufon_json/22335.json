The first sighting was September 19th. This time the craft was cylindrical in shape, like a cigarette, with a black vertical stripe in the middle. It was traveling slowly in the westerly direction, as I was traveling eastbound on Schoenersville Road in Bethlehem. I noticed the shape coming towards me in the sky as I sat in my car at a red light. As it came into view I realized that it was not a jet flying at a high altitude, but a substantially smaller craft. It moved slowly above the building to my left, and my son made a comment about the shape of the craft. It was a bright silver chrome, and it shone in the sun. It was a sunny day with a blue sky and no low-lying clouds or fog. The traffic light changed and I continued driving until it was out of sight."],"Longitude":"-75.362558","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Bethlehem","There were no other sightings in Bethlehem on or around March 9th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"03/09/2010 07:57 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder"}
