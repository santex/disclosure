Ive seen it up in the sky before, but nothing ever happened before. but tonite was when the thing started to move and i moved to watch it through the trees. i thought, ok, this could be a satalite, but then as it moved, it started to move faster and then it disappeared, i moved all over to see if i could see it again through the trees, but it was gone. I know that satelites don't just disapear. i know that it wasn't an airplane and i know it wasn't a \"shooting star\", i know what they all looked like. I may be starting to second guess myself as this was the first time ive ever seen this."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fountain Hill","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02012012-0003","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/01/2012 01:51 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/31/2012 09:00 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.601487","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
