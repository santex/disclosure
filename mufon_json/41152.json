I walked out, it was just about to get light. I noticed two sets of bright white lights on the sky on SE. I watched them and tried to make sens of them. Then i decided to wake up my friend and her son to see if they see the same thing. We had a telescope that we tried to aim at it and see it better. It appeared like a very very bright half moon but in front of the clouds. The sky was totally covered with thick clouds. We watched them for a while and then i decided to come in and see if other people have seen it as well. not sure what to make of it but to report it."],"Summary":"bright white lights 2 sets of three. the lower set were much brighter","City":"laural","Date of the Event":"07/26/2012 05:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-07262012-0003","trends":["There have been no other sightings in laural","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"41152","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=54.168834,+-4.520275(41152)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41152) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
