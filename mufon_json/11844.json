{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOkay. I had just had a long and stressful going away party. I was sad because we are moving, and I love our current house. So, I started taking pictures of trees that I will miss, outside of my house. Then I saw something zigzagging in the sky and I thought it was a pinecone falling off a tree. Then I took a picture of it and it sped away. I was creeped out and was light headed. I put it on my computer and I saw that it looked like a kind of triangle. But then I zoomed in and saw it was circular with something on the side."],"Case Number":"11844","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.032424,+-73.935982(11844)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11844) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-73.935982","Date of the Event":"07/22/0001 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/22/0001 12:00 UTC","Summary":"I Was Taking a Picture of the Sky and a strange UFOlike object showed up in it.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11844.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11844_submitter_file1__DSCF5597.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11844.html"],"Weather Factors":"Windy","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Saratoga","There were no other sightings in Saratoga on or around July 20th 0001","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-07312008-0011","City":"Saratoga","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"43.032424","Object Shape":"Cone, Egg, Star-like"}
