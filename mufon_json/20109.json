Flying plane lights it's what I usually tend to see at night at a distance, but this twinkle flash light was different......I grabbed my binoculars and was stunt by what I was seeing, It seemed as if the lights were shining diamonds (despite the fact that they were at a distance) I have never seen so brightness coming from a flying artifact. I couldn't tell how many lights the UFO had but they seemed white and blue*. After 30 minutes of looking at the object it all of a sudden started moving slowly, and at one point it ascended so fast that it disappear from my view and thought to myself that it was over. Shortly after about a few seconds the flying object reappear again (like in the same altitude, at least from my visual calculation) in the same area were initially it was hovering. Again, this continue until 3:00am were the object kept moving slowly as if it was hovering and at times it just seemed as if it was flying at a high altitude due to how smaller the flash light or Object seemed to fade and then it would descend. I had visual contact of the object from 1:54am until 3:00am, I couldn't stay up but the flashing light object stay hovering in the same area......... Also a helicopter with a bright light was flying at the time of the incident (at a much lower altitude of course) and for some reason it kept going around, I don't know if this helps but Im trying to be as detail as possible. My conclusion: No airplane (for sure) No Helicopter(no way) No Weather balloon(Give me a break!) No Flairs (Yeah Right) I have never seen a UFO before, Im enthusiastic on this topic and I believe this was a flying object that was behaving in a very odd way. I will continue to monitor this again,and report it if necessary but I won't loose sleep this time."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.301392,+-80.632692(20109)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20109) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-10242009-0011","City":"Miami, Metropolitan Area","Case Number":"20109","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Summary":"Flashing Lights","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Miami, Metropolitan Area","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/24/2009 06:39 UTC","Region":"Florida"}
