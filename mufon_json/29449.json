Suddenly, my husband pulled the car over to the shoulder. It was 9:05 at night and he pointed up into the sky. Over a field to our left, we saw five orange sphere-like objects hovering around each other. They were divided into groups of two and three. These spheres appeared to be probe-like. This made us uneasy. My husband took a picture with his cell phone. After 2 or 3 minutes, the first group disappeared and then the second group."],"Log Number":"US-06082011-0003","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Franklin","There were no other sightings in Franklin on or around June 4th 2011"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29449.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29449.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.934914,+-86.86483(29449)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29449) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Summary":"Five orange spheres were hovering in the sky.","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Longitude":"-86.86483","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Tennessee"}
