{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailssaw an orange light in the sky that appeared in the sky. in my opinion, this would rule out a lantern given that the light\\orb appeared about 60 degrees from the horizon. sightings occurred on two separate days a week apart from the other. the photo attached is of the first sighting which involved a single light\\orb in the sky. no radical movement and the light\\orb faded in the distance. the second sighting was more impressive. i was driving down the freeway with my girlfriend in the car and on the horizon appear 3 orb\\lights. this sighting the light\\orbs were moving between each other appearing and then disappearing several times. suddenly, two of the orbs moved north east with the other moving south west. orientation and direction was based on the fact that we were headed north on the freeway. i have attached photos of the first sighting. pretty strange and the third attachment is zoomed in to the object. hope to hear your analysis soon."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.877767,+-117.862476(46195)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46195) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-117.862476","Latitude":"33.877767","Case Number":"46195","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Summary":"Orange light in the sky","Date Submitted":"03/14/2013 11:17 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Placentia","There were no other sightings in Placentia on or around March 9th 2013"],"City":"Placentia","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46195.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46195.html"],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-03142013-0007","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/09/2013 07:15 UTC","Region":"California"}
