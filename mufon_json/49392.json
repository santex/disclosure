Twice yesterday afternoon, with no keys in the ignition, my car's dashboard lit up briefly and then went out. And then last night at approx. 11:15 pm, the power went out for 1-2 hours from Ormond Beach to New Smyrna Beach along the coast. The news reported this morning that there was no explanation. During the outage, I saw bright red trails in my back yard for an instant. I assumed that perhaps it was a smoke alarm reflection in the window, but after experimenting, I confirmed that it wasn't a reflection. Anyway, could be nothing but my intuition tells me otherwise. In hindsight, I did see a strange light in the sky last week while standing in my driveway, thought it was a lone cloud, but it abrupty disappeared after maybe 3-5 seconds. The sky was very clear at the time. If I'm not the only person reporting anything in this vicinity, I would like to know.
