{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI SAW THIS OBJECT BEFORE A FEW WEEKS AGO. FROM MY HOUSE, IT COMES FROM THE BOULDER CO. AREA, AT ABOUT 7,000 TO 10,000 FEET ABOUVE SEA LEVEL AND TRAVELS TOWARD BUKLEY AIR BASE IN A STRAIT LINE OR FLIGHT PATH. AFTER IT TRAVELS OVER HEAD, THE FIRST TIME IT DISAPEARED AFTER ABOUT A MILE, THE SECOND TIME IT CONTINUED TO BE BRIGHT UNTIL I LOST SIGHT OF IT BEHIND SOME TREES. AS IT TRAVELED DIRECTLY OVER HEAD I LOOKED AT IT THROUGH MY BINOCULARS AND DID NOT SEE A PLANE SHADOW JUST THE BRIGHT LIGHT. I LIVE NEAR DIA AND SEE PLANES ALL OF THE TIME. THIS THING IS STRANGE. I THOUGHT THAT IT COULD BE SOME SECRET AIRCRAFT SINSE IT SEEMS TO GO TOWARD BUCKLEY. BUT IT WOULD BE EXTREEMLY ADVANCED IF THAT IS THE CASE. IT MAKES NO NOISE OR SOUND AT ALL. WHEN WATCHING AIR PLANES I AM ABLE TO HEAR THEM AT 20,000 FEET. I BELIEVE THAT I WILL SEE THIS THING AGAIN. IT APEARED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME ON BOTH OCATIONS. I ACTUALLY THINK I SAW IT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO BUT THAT TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE AND STOPED WATCHING IT BEFORE IT GOT CLOSE."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.743204,+-104.979203(12948)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12948) map </A>","Case Number":"12948","City":"Denver","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Tags":"City","Summary":"BRIGHT LIGHT LIKE JUPITER, SAME SIZE ,NO PLANE SHAPE, JUST LIGHT","Region":"Colorado","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around October 7th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/07/2008 07:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12948.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12948.html"],"Log Number":"US-10082008-0002","Longitude":"-104.979203","Date of the Event":"10/07/2008 07:10 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.743204"}
