My mom said Look at that I looked to where she was pointing to the north-east and saw a Bright Orange Light. At first I thought it was a helicopter it was just hovering and moving slow southward across the sky I thought no big deal so I kept packing up the car. Then she said look another one. It followed the same path as the first one. At this point I figured it couldn't be a helicopter. Life flight in the area only has one Helicopter and none of the police stations in the area have any helicopters the nearest city that does is Cleveland and they are about 15 miles to the north. Just as I was thinking that here comes a third one same exact path as the first two almost as if there was a line in the sky they followed. The objects came from the north and where heading south. I was looking to the east. There is an airport however it is 10 miles in the opposite direction to my back. The 3 objects were just hovering for a few minutes there was no other objects in the sky and all 3 of them had perfect spacing in between them. Also it should be noted that the second object did not come into my sight until the first had stop moving. The same thing with the third object it didn���t come into sight until the second one had stopped moving. In my entire life I have never know of or even heard of any news helicopters or life flight or police stations sending 3 helicopters at the same time to any one thing. I also turned on the radio to see if it still worked it did. I ran upstairs to get my camera as I was running I kept thinking that by the time I get downstairs it will be gone. It took me all of 45 seconds to get back to my car and of course the lights were gone. When I got back upstairs my cats had a weird look on their face they were on the table which they never do and as I went over to pet them they both hissed at the same time which they also never do. When i left I also turned on the radio to see if there was a news report of any accidents in the area or police looking for a suspect I heard nothing of any accidents nearby or alert for suspects on the news or radio. That night when I got back to my military base I had a hard time sleeping and I over slept by 2 hours and 90 minutes the weird thing with that is that I never do that not to that length and I had a very loud and annoying alarm that was set. When I finally woke up the TV and lights in my hotel room where on as well. Later that day I got a lot of complaints from the other occupants of my hotel that my alarm was so loud it woke of all them up and it was going off for about 30 minutes none stop. I place the alarm on the night stand near my head all the time and I never heard a thing."],"Summary":"Bright Orange Lights 3 of them","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in North Royalton","There were no other sightings in North Royalton on or around January 1st 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44970.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44970.html"],"Longitude":"-81.749476","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","City":"North Royalton","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.314132,+-81.749476(44970)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44970) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01032013-0004"}
