I'm reporting this in the hopes that someone else may have seen this object to confirm what occurred. From what I understand, my two friends were driving home to Turner Valley from Calgary and as they were turning onto Highway 22x from McKenzie Lake Blvd in the SE of the city they witnessed a vibrant green orb that descended incredibly quickly at a 45 degree angle towards a park area. The object was described as having a bright green center, with a black circle around it and then another thin green ring. My one friend is ex-military and said he had never witnessed anything remotely like it in his life and that it was a highly unusual incident to him. He said it was no way that it was neither a helicopter or a plane and that it could not have been a flare or a meteorite because of the colour and the way that it moved. The object then disappeared in a park area by the river to the north of Highway 22x between Deerfoot Trail and McLeod Trail."],"Log Number":"CA-12252011-0012"}
