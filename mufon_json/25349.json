{"Date Submitted":"09/09/2010 12:29 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was talking to a friend of mine on the phone and as usuall i was outside just standing on the porch looking around at the night sky as i always do not thinking much about anything more than the conversation i was having,i then noticed what i thought was a meteor shooting across the sky and i even mentioned it to the friend i was on the phone with saying oh wow i haven't seen that in a while and then what ever it was stopped almost right above me just to my left and as it did i then saw a commercial plane coming up behind it heading in the same direction going north.The trees around my house are tall so you can't see planes or meteors or stars very good unless they are directly over a certain area of my yard anyway the object what ever it was as best as i can describe it appeared to be looking for something it was moving in a way that reminded me of a draggonfly moving back and forth with incredible speed and jerky movements i didn't even think were possible for aircraft,i am still stunned by what i saw i am at a loss for words i guess but as the commercial plane began to move across the sky to the north the object which was much lower than the commercial plane shot off to the north ahead of the plane.I am not a good judge of airliner speeds or plane speeds in general but this object shot off at a speed that got it straight out of sight heading north going upwards to a higher altitude so fast my eyes had a very hard time staying with it,the only speed i can think of that compares to it would be the speed of a meteor entering the earths atmosphere as you see it shoot across the sky,i am baffled by this what the heck was it? The whole incident with the object lasted about 4 or 5 seconds but the movements and the speed just don't seem real to me there is know way a person wound be able to withstand the force of such speed or the way the thing was shooting back and forth in different directions,i'm not telling anyone about this and using my name with the story there is know way anyone would believe me heck i don't even believe me and i saw it myself i just can't get over it and i'm quite sure i will be trying to rationalize it for a while and i know i will remember it for the rest of my life.I wish i didn't even see it because i was having a normal relaxed evening until this and now i will be up for a while just running that incident over and over in my head trying to catagorize it somehow..What was it that i saw? please help me to understand it!!!!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.107351,+-95.223922(25349)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25349) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09092010-0003","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25349.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25349.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Porter","There were no other sightings in Porter on or around September 8th 2010"],"Case Number":"25349","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"I can't describe this in 25 words or less first of all I'm still confused as to how anything could move like that and have people inside controlling it.","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","City":"Porter","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.107351","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-95.223922","Date of the Event":"09/08/2010 09:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Texas"}
