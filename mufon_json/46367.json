Lying on my right side, I could view the wall which was about two feet in front of me just beyond the open bedroom door. Another foot down the wall was the only window in the room. Behind me, a wall mirror was propped against the wall just to the left of the fouton. Blinking lights from a source outside were reflected perfectly from outside the window at just the right angle to reflect onto the mirror propped against the wall behind me, and then reflected across the fouton to the wall in front of me as I lay on my right side. I glanced up at the window and saw an aircraft hovering motionless in the sky perfectly positioned for me to see it clearly from my position on the floor. It had many blinking lights of red, blue, white, and possibly yellow, similar to those of a police or emergency vehicle during a stop. From my position on the bed on the floor looking upward, the craft appeared to be in the shape of a boomerang. There were round balls of colored lights equidistant across both wings which appeared to blink randomly. There was no sound that I could hear. The window was closed. I had never seen a craft like this before, but thought it might be an alien craft. Just then, I felt the presence of three or four beings in my bedroom. I continued to lay on the fouton with my head on the pillow. I could feel their energy but not see them. Clearly, I could distinguish the sense of three beings and possibly a fourth one. Then, as if in my mind���s eye, I saw the image of a grey ET and telepathically heard, ���We don���t want to scare you���. Before I could process this statement to respond, the grey lifted his spindly arm and with an arc of his arm and like the flick of a switch, I was out cold, asleep. I had not looked at the clock (which was on the night stand behind me) when I first awoke and saw the lights. Nor did I look at the clock when I again opened my eyes to find myself still lying in bed. So, I don���t know the exact time of the visitation or how long it lasted. I felt as if I needed to urinate. So, I got up. As I stood up in the dark room, I could not see them with my eyes but could feel the energy of at least three beings and possibly a fourth. Their energy felt a bit more diffused than when I was lying down. I could feel them watching me, observing. I walked across the hall to the bathroom, urinated, and returned to my bed. I sensed that they had me arise to use the bathroom just to observe me to see if I could go about this common routine. I felt as if they were scientists watching, whispering comments about my ability to carry out this routine task. I mumbled to myself as I returned to bed, annoyed that I didn���t know what was going on. Yet I was compliant in completing the routine. As I put my head on the pillow, lying on my right side as I was before, I felt very sleepy, unable to keep my eyes open. I struggled to keep my eyes open but they would close on me and I would force them open and they would close again, as if I was drugged. Finally, I succumbed to the extreme drowsiness, allowing my eyes to close and I went back to sleep. I don���t know how much time lapsed. For a brief moment, I reopened my eyes and gazed at the window where I saw a small grey ET peering in the closed window at me. He was standing on the balcony just outside of the bedroom window. I would estimate him to be about three feet tall. His large head was typical of the greys seen in pictures. His large expressionless solid black eyes stared at me. His nose looked like a couple of small holes with an almost nonexistent mouth. He cocked his head to the left side in an inquisitive sort of way. His movements and the expression on his face appeared rather mechanical, as if devoid of emotion or any sort of deep thought. His affect and head movement was more robotic than organic. I wanted to keep looking and see what would happen next, but an overwhelming sense of sleepiness overcame me and I closed my eyes. My curiosity compelled me to force my eyes open one more time. The grey was gone from the balcony and I felt no energetic presence of any other beings in my apartment. I immediately saw a white orb of light dart from the apartment building up towards the boomerang-shaped craft that remained hovering in the sky. The light joined the end of the wing closest to me, appearing consistent as the other lights along the wings. Instantly, the ship darted upwards to the left (from my perspective), disappearing from my view through the window. Still struggling with a feeling of overwhelming fatigue, and despite my attempts to keep my eyes open, my eyes closed and I immediately returned to sleep. I slept through the night until the alarm clock woke me in the morning to get ready for work. I stood up from the fouton and looked around the bedroom. Everything appeared normal. I slowly walked into the bathroom, glanced down the hallway and into the livingroom. Nothing appeared any different from when I went to bed the night before. I had no obvious changes to my body and otherwise felt like normal. I have no sense of time about the incident, that is, what time it occurred in the night or how long it lasted. So, it may have occurred before midnight on October 27, 2010 or in the early morning of October 28, 2010. As I got ready for work, I kept wondering where the craft and greys came from, why they visited me in particular, and what they did when I was asleep. I continue to wonder and would love to find the answers."],"Date of the Event":"10/27/2010 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
