(logically, i thought perhaps it is a meteor, and i was about to call dad and val. however, i know meteors are not long lived and i didn't want to miss it.) so the meteor continued across the night sky at a very fast speed. so next, the large meteor made several quick manuvers from straight to almost completely parrallel to the previous position. the meteor seemed to be capable of making stairs in the sky. moving again from the north to the south to completely west to the south to completely west to the south. no human could have survivied the speed or the manuevers this large aircraft was doing. i can't even imagine the g-forces in which the aircraft was under as it made the stair formation. or what sort of propulsion system allowed an aircraft\\meteor to travel straight to completely latteral in movement and then completely straight again. at this point i noticed the meteor\\aircraft (still very large and flashing a distinct pattern of redish, blueish and purplish hues in sequence) was tracking on what would be considered a normal airplane. the airplane was the size of a fighter jet at very high altitudes. the fighter jet was pretty much a dot in the sky compared to the meteor\\aircraft. it had the normal red and white flashing lights but they were barely detectable. the airplane was moving in an arced motion in the atomosphere traveling from north to south. i noticed that the previous movements by the \"unidentified flying object\" were to bring it on a direct intercept course with the (assumed)fighter jet. the \"ufo\" then in close proximaty to the fighter jet attacked or something. because in the spot of the fighter jet was a very bright competely circular light (just to the north and east of where the fighter jet had been was a less dense red completely circular light. they both held in place for approximately a second). both lights disappeared and there was no trace of the fighter jet where the white circular light had been. the \"ufo\" continued on its path with the same flashing of vibrant colors for a short bit than vanished almost into itself in the night sky. meteors cannot make logical manuvers. airplanes aren't that size and don't flash those colors. and if it was indeed an airplane where was the sound? also, who has the resources to build such a large aircraft? it was definitely traveling faster than the speed of sound. there should have been a sonic boom at that speed. unless what i saw happened completely in outerspace. how could it make those manuvuers? how could it just disappear into itself. how could it make the red and white circular lights appear and hold in place and then disappear? and how did it make the airplane disappear? what happened to it? what the heck is going on? in another e-mail i wrote: i did find one thing interesting about my sighting. everyone always says they can tell the shape and what not. the lights from it were so bright i have no idea the shape of the ufo. the damn thing was moving so fast there and cutting those stairs it could have been shaped as a round pile of crap for all i know. what i do know for sure is that on june 2 at approximately 130am in the morning over the northeastern skies i saw a large ufo."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.129214,+-82.92752(11031)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11031) map </A>","Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States"}
