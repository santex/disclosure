The first photo looked like there was a greyish bar beside the planet. I thought that perhaps my camera lense had a scratch on it...so I took another photo and noticed the greyish bar was still there but had moved lower in the sky. We brought the camera inside so we could get it on the computer and zoom in. When we zoomed in we saw 2 copper bars connected by different coloured lights. Tried to get more photos after that but it was gone. I could not see the object with the naked eye. Only in the photo. You'll notice in the photo that the \"bar\" has moved downwards between photos. All the stars are in the same place. Also... we have a lot of Fireball Orb activity in the area over Lake Ontario. We seem them at least once a month."],"Object Features":"Other","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There was one other sighting in Toronto on or around October 25th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Latitude":"43.776426","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Flat DNA looking UFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43539.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43539_submitter_file1__IMG1348.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43539_submitter_file2__IMG1349.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43539.html"],"Tags":"City"}
