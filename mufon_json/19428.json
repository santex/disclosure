We were starring at it for about 30 secconds and then it startted to disolve in a way and about 2 minutes later it was totally gone. We were talking about for 20 minutes after that saying nobody will believe us then we called my nana and she couldnt believe it either. Then we were getting ready to go back home around 8 a truck drove by and stopped in the place where you park they were 3 fisherman and we were saying hello and being friendly then one of the 3 men said did you see that light about 30 minutes ago? we of course said yes knowing we werent the only ones who saw it we were happy. It ended up they were our neighbors and they saw it while they were fishing over the newport bridge and they came back because they noticed it was closer to our house they were happy we had saw it also. we were too but we know we not the only witnesses. that is my story on my UFO sightin."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 09:39 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 07:23 UTC","Latitude":"41.582646","City":"North Kingstown"}
