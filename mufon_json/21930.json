{"Object Shape":"Cross","Case Number":"21930","divs":["sighting detailstuesday night, 2\\16 at about 6:20, i was driving home, heading north on ne 33rd ave, the closest cross street was probably prescott. the sky was almost dark, a deep twilight blue. i saw a large, cross shaped craft fly out of the east, across my field of vision, then make a large arc and head north by west and dissapear from my view behind the trees and buildings heading east by north. as it crossed in front of my car, i looked up and saw the under-structure which appeared to be a perfectly symetrical cross shape with lights on the outer ends of the arms. as it started to make it's arc, it also banked so i could no longer see the underside. the whole event took approximately 10-15 seconds. i immediately pulled to the side of the road and called keith rowell of oregon mufon to discuss the incident. the craft seemed to be flying lower than regular air traffic, and the night sky was very clear, with a very slight breeze blowing from north to south. the lights on the craft were red and white, i think. the red lights were blinking, but i don't recall how fast. it was hard to judge the size and height of the craft, but based on the clarity of the structual outline and the speed (it was moving very rapidly) i would say it was about the size of a large airplane and lower in the sky than most would fly in that area. when i got home, i was out on my porch (this is just about a mile east of the place where i sighted the craft). i was noticing the air traffic, as it seemed heavier than normal. i live very near the airport. the planes i observed from my porch (normal air traffic for the area) were very high in the sky and moved much slower than the craft i saw. they appeared very ordinary. so i felt sure that what i saw was not part of the normal air traffic or craft for that area."],"Log Number":"US-02182010-0006","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"02/16/2010 06:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oregon","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.531782,+-122.670627(21930)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21930) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"02/18/2010 05:55 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.670627","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21930.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21930.html"],"trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were no other sightings in Portland on or around February 16th 2010"],"City":"Portland","Latitude":"45.531782","Summary":"saw cross shaped object low in sky, moving fast, in an arc","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
