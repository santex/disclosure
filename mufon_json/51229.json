I was looking at the sky talking to a friend when this large boomerang shaped ship flew into my view. It was moving south to north. I watched it until it disappeared. Like 4 seconds. It made No sound. It had several round lights on the wing. I had no idea what the object was it happened so fast. I'd like to think its man made but I've never seen anything so big moving so fast making no noise. I feel very lucky to have witnessed this. I'm amazed. I had to tell someone ASAP. I found Doug's number and called. I'm beside myself knowing that boomerang ship does for sure exist and it not some discovery channel BS."],"Case Number":"51229","Date of the Event":"09/30/2013 08:17 UTC","Object Features":"Wings","Latitude":"39.743679","Date Submitted":"10/01/2013 12:28 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
