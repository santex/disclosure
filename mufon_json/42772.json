I went two blocks and just happened to look up and caught what i first thought to be a shooting star. Med to large round like object, (it was dark so it was hard to determine distance away and scale of object) moving north to south at very high speed with no sound at all. There were no visible details of a particular craft or anything just a large glowing ball of light. I began to doubt a shooting star and started to get very excited when I realized the object was moving parallel to the ground at maybe 700 to a 1000 ft. Not coming down at an angle like shooting star might. And the fact that the object became visible for a few seconds then disappeared the same way while moving fast north to south. I started to get very excited and a little nervous when i tried to explain to myself what it might have been, and could not come up with a logical explanation. I have never seen any man made vehicle travel at this kind of speed especially with no noise during or after visual contact. I have always been intrigued by the possibility of ufo's but until now I have never seen anything that might qualify as one, or made me wonder until now. I know what i saw, and I saw it very clearly with no obstruction. I am happy to say I had my first visual contact with somethin unexplainable. It gives me butterflies in my stomach the more I think about it. I spent the rest of the walk with my dogs scanning the sky in hopes of seeing something else but to no avail. Skies were clear."],"Object Features":"None"}
