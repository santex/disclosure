(but we just saw 4 of those lights) it might have been that the objects on that video have been those chinese lights but i collected the information of all comments left there and put them on a map. i will send you an attachment with what i found out. i'm sorry that i wrote it on that map in german but \"orange lichter\" means \"orange lights\". my brother had a look onto that map on my google earth i created and said that it looks very much like a flight corridor to him. what ever it was - military project or ufo's - it was very interesting for me to see it. (would it make sense to start a military project on new years eve when everybody is looking into the sky???) i wish you all well kind regards *(name deleted--cms\\sg). ps: i am not sure who you are calling \"third party\" below but for now i would not like to have my details given to third parties."],"Object Features":"None","City":"Bracknell","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Unknown","Region":"England","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"51.42248","Case Number":"27698"}
