I did see an airplane and a helicopter before but it stood there and it made no sound. From were I was it looked the size of an airplane. There was a black line through the metallic pellet object I believe to be a row of windows. How it happened was kind of funny. I was in the 3 foot end of the pool trying to get on the darn raft why my friends were in the 6 foot end. I was finally on the raft when I lay down and see something in the sky. I looked at it for 7 sec before trying to get a closer look but the raft and myself started drifting away to a point were all I could see was a tree. I tried so hard to get back but it didn't work. I got of the raft and swam over myself only to find it GONE ?! I didn't tell anyone until I returned home. The sighting was random and made me ponder what the heck ! What kind of object jest floats there ?!"],"Region":"Oregon","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07092012-0029","Object Features":"Window(s)","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"40648","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-122.714592"}
