I was told they are already here. Without hestitation with his stories, I wanted more evidence. So I was driven out to a dirt road and I saw it. It was dark, I mean real dark. No light, just the objects that twinkled. I have been changed for the rest of my life because of that story. The next day I was in a state of shock. The government has knowledge like you will never believe. The military knows more about it than you think. Never lost sight of the object, just now know they! are hear. Call me crazy, call me stupid. I know what I saw. Just don't laugh at me."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Plainwell","There were no other sightings in Plainwell on or around August 28th 2004"],"Date of the Event":"08/28/2004 12:00 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like, Other, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.440036,+-85.648904(6056)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6056) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.648904","Log Number":"US-01022007-0011","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other,Unknown","Case Number":"6056","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.440036","Country":"United States","Summary":"These particular objects hovered and changed colors.....at night"}
