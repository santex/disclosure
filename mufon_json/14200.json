I would say that the altitude was less than 2000 feet. The pattern then changed to a V formation moving NW very slowly. I went around to the front of my house to follow the lights, and my neighbors' parents were in the driveway unpacking their car. I asked the gentleman if he observed the lights also. He confirmed them, and was as puzzled as I to what it could be. There was no sound associated with them. They continued NW in movement and we lost sight of them because of trees."]}
