At first I thought they were helicopters but they were weird and fuzzy looking. As they got close to me they seemed to be chasing each other and bobbing up and down then they moved to the south east...Two seemed to fly towards each other then one looked like it flew around and behind the other one and then side by side they kept going and the further they went the smaller and dimmer they got until they were the size of small stars up in the stars then they disappeared. Then one single one came from the same direction and flew the same direction where the other ones went. This one seemed to move faster until it too disappeared way up high. I called for my husband to come see and he didn't know what they were either. The light was much larger than jets and from afar they looked like wide light bulbs or parasails but orange and glowing."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.297272,+-121.8989(49815)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49815) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49815.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49815.html"],"Longitude":"-121.8989"}
