He has seen multiple numbers of large lighted orbs, the smallest one being 15 feet in diameter, up to 25 or 30 feet in diameter. The first sighting involved a very close encounter with the light, and since then he sees lights following him in his vehicle whereever he travels in Missouri an nearby states. He is a boiler engineer for power plants and does a lot of travel. The balls of light simply appear and dissapear, and do not move away. They start out as a blue color, then change to red, then yellow."],"Log Number":"US-09012010-0007","Summary":"Multiple sightings of large balls of light since 2006 in Missouri and other states","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Missouri","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/01/2010 02:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.970633","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25260","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25260.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25260.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Light","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
