This was in an apartment complex. Approxiamate time estimated around 9 pm, during twilight. Sky visible from balcony. The sun was setting and this was in the twilight period. I noticed a point of light above me in the sky, projecting a diffuse, dim beam of light at a 45 degree angle toward the ground. This point of light was very discrete and definite and clearly visible as being only about 20 feet above me, and perhaps 8 feet forward of me, the way I was facing. Thus. 8 feet from my building, horizontally. This point of light was stationary. It did not move or pan. It appeared to be about 3 inches in diameter and round. It appeared exactly like looking at the lense of a flashlight, if it were pointed in your direction. It was as though I was looking at a handheld flashlight hovering 20 feet above my head in the sky---but with one major peculiarity: only the lense of the flashlight, and the projected beam of light, were visible. No housing or metal enclosure was visible. The best way to describe this effect in words would be if you turned on a flashlight, then painted the handle and housing with a paint that made it invisible. In other words, only the light it shone was visible. The beam of light coming from it appeared in every way like a modern incandescent flashlight beam. Diffuse and yellow-white, just like an incandescent bulb. Not a linear laser-like beam. It spread out in a cone---just like a flashlight or search light. There were no aircraft below the cloud cover in the night sky at that time, and this point of light was obviously, clearly, and unmistakably at most only 20 feet or so above me. That would put it at an altitude about 30 feet above ground. An obvious search light. But not attached to any building--just hovering in the open sky. After puzzling about it for 10 seconds, I saw the projected search light appear to pan up, as if the searchlight were being pivoted skyward. It was a smooth, mechanical change in beam angle, not erratic. As if a searchlight were being retracted up into something. Once the beam pivoted to about parallel with the ground, it appeared to 'fold-p' into some invisible object, or just to disappear. Then the point of light and the beam of light were just gone. folded up into the sky. No sound, no wind. That ended the event."],"Case Number":"15705","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15705.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15705.html"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.287346,+-83.738788(15705)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15705) map </A>"}
