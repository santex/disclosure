It was some distance away but very large. The entire thing was glowing green, like the whole object was a light, rather than lights on it. We immediately thought it was a UFO, even though neither of us believed in UFOs or aliens, and had never seen one before. It flew away from us towards the west in a straight line. The object was very large, and it would take three people held at arm's length to cover it up. I still can't believe what we saw, but it was definatley not a plane.\""],"Tags":"City"}
