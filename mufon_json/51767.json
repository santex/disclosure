A few hours later it started moving suddenly and it disappeared, vanished completely. We were really freaked out but did not think anything of it. And then few moments later, a helicopter passed nearby and another aeroplane flew into the same direction as where the light was to be seen. I took a photograph of it but it is not recognisable and barely visible."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
