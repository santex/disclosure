(good iphone) i have a bunch of before and after pictures so the black sky to the lighted sky will happen in steps. i can send all of them to you if you want. i am freaked never ever did i expect to catch anything but lightning or a lighted sky off the trees or lake. wow. we have camped at the lake and taken pictures many as well but never saw anything like this!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"11/04/2012 03:07 UTC","Latitude":"33.4207"}
