{"Log Number":"US-09132008-0012","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsAttending a small outdoor party in Bernardsville. I was facing South West when I noticed 4 to 5 moving ojects in the sky. The unusual formation, brightness and motion drew my attnetion. At first I thought they could be helicaptors. They flew to near each other to be planes. They appeared to be in loose formation. One object was brighter than others. All moving vertical, upwards....Within 1 to 2 minutes of observation 2 to 3 objectives merged into the one brightest object. Now the one object continued to rise. A plane flying perpendicular gave us a good sense for height comparison. This object was much higher. 2 to 3 minutes later, the object vanished. The lights disappeared like a light switch being shut off. Four individuals, in addition to myself, saw the object in the sky."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"New Jersey","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12461.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12461.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/13/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"4 or 5 objects, one brighter than others moving in formation upward","Case Number":"12461","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-74.563484","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.722252","City":"Bernardsville","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Bernardsville","There were no other sightings in Bernardsville on or around September 13th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.722252,+-74.563484(12461)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12461) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/13/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown"}
