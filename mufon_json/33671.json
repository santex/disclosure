As we pulled into the entrance to Mid-Ohio race car course the object began to move. It moved between us and the twp road. To me when the object seemed to notice it was drawing attention to itself it accelerated off quickly. We chased it down the road then it disapeared. After picking up another counter part we seen the object again moving very slowly across the sky. Object then did a real quick u-turn and proceeded back over mid-ohio race course track. It seemed to be drawn to this spot. This was the last we seen of it.
