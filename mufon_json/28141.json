It got my attention as most aircraft around here do not come from that direction. Observed it for awhile trying to determine what it was. As it moved closer and no definite outline of the object was seen, I decided to go for my camera. Had only time for one shot by this time as it just disappeared .It was moving at a slow steady pace and just faded out of sight. Watched for it to reappear but it did not. The image in the picture is as clear as I saw it. Was a fuzzy glowing object that I would estimate to be about half the size of a small Cessna type aircraft. I am an avid skywatcher and this one was a mystery. Never seen nothing like it."],"Date Submitted":"03/07/2011 09:49 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
