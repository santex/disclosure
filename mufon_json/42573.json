We had to stop at a stop light and when we did something caught my eye so i looked up in the sky and i saw three lights turning in a circle. the stop light turned green so i went and i was saying to my husband what is that i need to go back and see where those lights are coming from. so i did they had not moved. we stopped and looked for about 5 min. it kept doing the same thing over and over so i said lets go home. so we went home about three miles down the road when we got there you could still see the lights. at home we watched it for about 20 min. and it never moved it just kept rotating in a circle. the lights were not very bright they looked as if they were behind the clouds. you couldn't see a beam or anything that indicated were the light was coming from. this was the first time i have ever seen anything like this before."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Greensboro","Longitude":"-79.814472","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.110901,+-79.814472(42573)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42573) map </A>","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Greensboro","There was one other sighting in Greensboro on or around September 9th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Triangle","Log Number":"US-09152012-0010","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42573.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42573.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/09/2012 01:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"36.110901","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
