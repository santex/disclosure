I entered a farmer's field, and started down my walk. After a while, i was the only one in a long while away. Then it happened. I noticed something out of the corner of my eye and I saw a strange light in the sky. At first, I thought it was a star, or a satillite, but then it became multicolored and grew in size. It emitted a low hum sound, and it rapidly came toward me. The whole night seemed to go silent as it hovered over me, and then accelerated again. I watched as it beamed a light down towards my inlaw's house. Confused, I began to walk back, and decided that I was just crazy. But after some time, I realized that I had actually seen it."],"Region":"Nebraska","Latitude":"41.497957","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Unknown","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33752.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33752.html"],"City":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Diamond"}
