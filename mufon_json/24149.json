This object looked like molten fire. It had a glowing red to it, like molten rock. It was not a meteor and i dont believe it to be a satellite on fire, because i have witnessed that before. It was not a hot air balloon nor an airplane. There were no blinking lights on this object. It was hard to tell the elevation of the object, but its elevation was steady, it was not descending. It disappeared heading Northwest and took about 20 seconds to disappear. This object was not a plane. It freaked my wife and i out, and we were not drinking alcohol when this occurred."],"Summary":"Molten fire ball flying steadily through TX sky.","City":"Austin","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"24149","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 09:35 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07052010-0002","Longitude":"-97.736001","Source":"MUFON"}
