After getting binoculars (Tasco 10x50mm) to see multi colored lights (red, green and white) which did not move from its location. No idea of size or shape really, though presumably large as it was high in the sky and some color was noticable by the naked eye. Could not determine shape of the object as I could only see the lights which seemed to flicker but only went off once for a split second then back on. Just very curious. Have never seen anything like this before, heard about it, just never seen it."],"Date Submitted":"11/06/2009 02:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20337.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20337.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.254783,+-92.143504(20337)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20337) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval, Unknown","Latitude":"31.254783","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"20337","Country":"United States","Summary":"Extended viewing of object via binoculars - stationary, multicolored light object in the sky.","Log Number":"US-11062009-0004"}
