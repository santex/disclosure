i began to become excited. i knocked on the door to show my mother whom i had just woken but she didn't answer, so i knocked on her bedroom window. later we realized that she was passing through the door to use the restroom and i had just missed her at both places. the cloud was drifting, so i had to crane my neck to see it and when i did, the tip exposed itself. it was black in color and was a perfectly shaped triangle. i tried to follow it but it passed over my neighbor's house and into the trees. i did get to see it for about 10 seconds and since the cloud had a silver lining from the sun and it was a good distance ( approx. 30 -35 feet from the silver lining.) i definitely could tell it wasn't part of the cloud. since i no longer could see that, i turned my attention back to the cube, bbut it was beginning to break up. so i focused on the dark shape inside the cloud. that's when part of the cloud opened up and i saw the back of what was in the cloud! what i saw was the tail end of a craft of some sort. it was enormous! i couldn't see the entire tail end of what was in the craft, but i did see multiple rows of rectangles not all the same in size and length, but perfect in shape laying horizontally. they weren't all the same in color and size, but where all perfectly shaped. they were earthy tones like copper, khaki, beige and light browns. after watching this for a moment as the cloud began to envelope the back end, a pod of 8 or 9 purple martins floated into the scene. i've grown up with these birds and they weren't acting normal in nature. they almost looked metallic in color. i instantly felt the feeling as if something was trying to sway my attention. the birds where riding a thermal, but none of them flapped their wings, which is unusual for 8 or 9 martins to not be doing. my mother later pointed out that maybe they where riding the thermal of this craft and\\or what punched through the cloud. but i beg to differ, but do consider. i could no longer see the darkness in the cloud when returning my attention back to it. \"they succeeded,\" i told myself. i finally returned my attention to the door and wanted to tell my mother of this experience. she was very upset that see didn't get to see it, but if i turned my head away then it would have darted off. i got on the road and went to work. on my way, i was looking at other clouds trying to find it or find something else. there where other dark masses in the clouds, but none like what i had just witnessed and what a perfect way to cloak itself. i went to work twice yesterday. once in the morning and again at 10:30pm central time. because i was looking for it in the day, i was on my way to work and not coming home. she tells it as if i where on my way home and not on the way to work. she and my grandmother both complained to me of having a terrible headache when i returned home from work around 4:30 pm. but i can't get her to understand that how could i be looking for a cloud with sun on it and dark shapes in them if i'm at home and not driving? she remembers me telling her that i would tell grandmother about it over coffee on sunday morning (june, 29, 2008) because i wanted to take a nap before returning to work that evening. i thought i had it explained to her, but she refuses to believe me. as i type this, she's telling me that i'm still wrong. interesting footnote, last night i dreamed of fibers being pulled from my head. but i know i was looking for it in the day because i saw it during the day while it was day light and how i could look for a cloud with sun on it at 10:30pm? this was a most unusual experience and the fourth experience at witnessing something in the sky out of the ordinary and only 200 or 250 feet above me hanging at a low rate of speed hiding in a cloud and with so many other unusual characteristics attributed to it and all without a sound. i'm a believer, have been a believer and now i know why i'm a believer. another guy i work with has been seeing objects over his house and i've been reading reports of objects being seen all over the houston area. keep looking up folks. they're up there!"],"Region":"Texas"}
