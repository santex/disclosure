I looked up at the moon, which was very bright and saw Jupiter below and to the left of the moon. I looked down at my cell phone and looked back up. Two new objects, or lights, appeared. I thought they may have been stars at first. Then I noticed they were moving. Thought they might be planes. Then one of the lights faded and vanished. The second object faded a few seconds afterwards. It was to bright for the objects to be satellites. They weren't moving fast enough to be meteors. I'm not sure what exactly they were. It may have been the sun reflecting off something in space. But all I know is the objects were only visible for about a minute. I tried to take a picture but the camera on my phone was not good enough to capture these objects."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25974.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25974.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/18/2010 07:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"25974","Summary":"Two objects below Jupiter in the sky","City":"Reno","Disposition":"IFO"}
