{"Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving to work. I was on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe heading North about 2 or 3 miles South of Sand Harbor on highway 28. From the Northwest, my left and foreward, I saw a blue light come up from behind the mountains. It was bright enough that I could not see the road and had to turn my head. I never closed my eyes and could see the blue light on my passenger seat. It lasted only a second or maybe even a fraction of. My first thought was lightning, I loooked out at the sky thinking I hadnt heard of any storms coming in and saw only stars on a clear night sky. No clouds. Then I realized that lighting isnt blue. I asked coworkers if they had seen the same flash I had seen and it appears that I am the only one that witnessed this. Also, when the light came up, it seemed a dome shape."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-120.183253","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Date Submitted":"01/17/2013 10:32 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Truckee","There were no other sightings in Truckee on or around January 17th 2013"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Blue Flash in sky.
