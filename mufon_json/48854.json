The UFO moved very slowly in a straight path, very slow unlike a plane that moved in a steady pace. The UFO changed direction disappeared as if the lights were turned off. Then reappeared in the same position the continued to move slowly in its current position, then disappeared into a cloud. The UFO moved upwards into a cloud then I did not see it again. I knew that it wasn't a plane or a Star, and I wasn't the only person that seen it. Me and my friends did and knew that it was really weird. My friend tried to take a picture but wasn't able to, his phone stopped working. He was already taking pictures of the fireworks and didn't have a problem with his phone until he tried to take a picture of the UFO. I felt amazed to finally see one, and also curious to know if anyone else has seen one also."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Longitude":"-76.140758"}
