Just happened to look up and noticed a boomerang shaped object heading south. There were no lights and no sound coming from it. It did reflect light though which was why I noticed it. At first I thought it was a stealth jet, then realized that it was too wide and not shaped quite right for that. I lost sight of it as it went over the top of the house. I just went in, jotted it all down in my journal and went to bed. Didn't report it soner because I don't want to be considered one of the looney people."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4386.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4386.html"],"Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-104.975453","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.747384,+-104.975453(4386)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4386) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02062006-0001","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/02/2005 10:30 UTC","City":"Denver"}
