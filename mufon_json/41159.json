They appeared to be many miles west of me and if it was one object it was much bigger than any plane I know of, the objects were parallel to each other. At the time I was driving west bound in my car in Mesa Arizona. The reason I noticed them is they were orange and not blinking. I have no idea what they were. They appeared to be heading west bound but I could not tell for sure because they were so far away. I know they were not heading north or south. I wea hoping to go home and ge a camera but they disappeared. I was wondering if anyone besides me saw anything that night (7-17-12)"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"33.32154","Date Submitted":"07/26/2012 01:18 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41159.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41159.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41159.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/17/2012 10:00 UTC"}
