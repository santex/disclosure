I was watching it when it seemed to turn in the other direction it was heading west and looked like it turned to the south when I thought I was looking at the back of it I could see a tiny star like light and then it just disappeared. It was a clear day and my wife was with me but I didn't tell her about it when i saw it because I thought it was just an airplane. anyways im sure it wasn't an airplane, because they dont just disappear."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
