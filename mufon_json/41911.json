{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving to work from my house. The car in front of me slowed and I happened to look up to the south and there were two bright lights near eachother. I was not sure I'd they were planes or . as I was watching them one of them dropped an object to the earth that either emitted or reflected light. At first I wondered if a bomb was being dropped but therewas no sounds or explosion. I called my mom immediately. I turned my car away from the incident as I was explaining what happened and then noticed the two lights had traveled on the direction I just turned (ne) and continued their path until I no longer saw them . I figured if it were a military operation they would have gone toward the base but they did not."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41911.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41911.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.716323,+-97.360374(41911)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41911) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-08212012-0003","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around August 20th 2012"],"Longitude":"-97.360374","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Other","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"08/21/2012 06:35 UTC","Latitude":"32.716323","City":"Fort Worth","Date of the Event":"08/20/2012 09:56 UTC","Case Number":"41911","Summary":"2 possible helicopters stationary for a moment then dropped an object to the earth","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
