It is very difficult to guesstimate speed, so I am reluctant to do so...especially given its proximity...having said that if pressed to make a guess...I would say it was well over 3000 mph (well over). The plane was so close that literally it was seen as only a metalic blur that passed in a nanosecond. No wings, no engines, no tail descernable. I would have doubted I even saw it if for the very fine vapor trail it left which allowed me to guesstimate just how close it was to the aircraft I was in. There was no turbulance encountered by my aircraft, which seemed unsual given the promimity. No alarms went off. No one else seemed to notice. No reports were filed with the FAA by the pilot. The FAA has no record of any event About 60 seconds later the aircraft made a slight course correction to the left."],"Date of the Event":"10/07/2007 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/07/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar","Summary":"near-miss at 35K ft somewhere over Nevada","Latitude":"38.81205","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10302007-0003","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"8251","Longitude":"-116.409429"}
