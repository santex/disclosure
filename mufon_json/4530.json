(i was looking out in a south-west direction from my house). i watched the larger ufo which did not move, stayed stationary for over an hour and rotated lights from white to yellow to green to red to blue and sometimes two colors at the same time. the overall outline was white diamond shaped. my husband works the evening shift and was due home and i was hoping he would get home in time to verify what i was seeing so i wouldn't think i was imagining it. he came home at 11:00 p.m. and i immediately showed him it and then he got the binoculars and confirmed everything from the diamond shape to the colors. he said it could be a comet, but i don't think comets stay in one spot for one hour? or rotate in colors? it stayed there and we were tired of looking at it as looking through binculars for a long time gets tiring. it was too far way that i knew my camera would not be able to take a good picture or clear enough picture so i didn't bother. now i wish i tried at least! we watched tv for awhile and i went back out to see if it was still there, but it was gone. this was about 11:20 p.m. i looked for it the next few nights just in case i mistook it for a star or whatever, but it has not been back since."],"Longitude":"-72.581831","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
