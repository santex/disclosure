He stated that he was returning from a house fire in St. Clair, Missouri at approximately 3:00 AM and was on I-44 Highway approaching Union, Missouri when he heard law enforcement on the county police band radio discussing an unidentified object. The dispatcher said ���Oh it's this Roswell stuff again.��� and that police were chasing the object. As the witness approached 50 hwy and 47 hwy he saw a large triangular craft with lights pointing down over the Wal-Mart that was traveling at approximately 25-30 MPH. The witness said that the very bright lights on the object pointed downward, but did not light up the ground, seeming to stop approximately 100' feet up. The craft was approximately 500' above the ground. The witness joined up with an officer from Union, Missouri and an officer from the County, and the three of them followed the object in their separate cars for approximately one hour as the object headed towards Washington, Missouri, north of the original position. The object was always in front of them or above them. At one point, the county officer attempted to tilt his dash cam up in order to get pictures, but it would not move into the needed position. None of the men had a camera with them. The object stopped and hovered several times and moved very slowly. They were unable to use the radio for communication while the craft was above them. After an hour, the officers needed to turn back to get back to other calls, so this witness left as well. By this time, the object had moved into an area SE of Washington, MO over farmland where there were no roads, and it was impossible to follow. __________________________________ The witness surmises that the object from Illinois continued into Missouri and officers picked up its trail after it crossed the state line."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40861.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.443152,+-91.040281(40861)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40861) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Triagular Craft January 2000 may be part of mass sightings in Illinois","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-91.040281","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Missouri","City":"Union"}
