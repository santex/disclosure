I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me, but the light did not go away. It hovered over (L.A.)city while these other objects passed with great speed by planes and one helicopter. It was awesome! To hard to discribe in words. I was amazed,happy and excited so I kept on filming when all of a sudden they all were gone. It was later that I saw that my footage was 30 minutes long. Time flys when you film-U.F.O's. You don't need to come to me. I'll go to you. Interested? Then call me. I have questions for you that you might be able to answer."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.97137,+-117.990559(39074)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39074) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-117.990559"}
