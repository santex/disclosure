I have already seen a couple of meteors when I saw three lights in a triangle formation. Immedietly after thinking it was just a plane all three lights broke apart in different directions. They did not travel far from each other and after just a few seconds they came back together but this time in single line formation. They then did slow, round circle manouvers for the duration of about a minute when suddenly they came to a complete stop in the sky. After hovering there for a couple of seconds they then sped away at a faster speed until they were out of sight. During this time of sighting I felt much excitment and a little shock of actually seeing a UFO. I was quite excited about the event for some time after it as well."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/12/2007 12:10 UTC","Country":"Canada","Log Number":"CA-08142007-0008","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"53.546674","Date Submitted":"08/12/2007 12:10 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.546674,+-113.484732(7677)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7677) map </A>"}
