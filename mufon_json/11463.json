We saw a circle shaped object, which I initially thought were the embers or remains of a large firework moving across the sky. However, it did not fade as the other embers did and was too large and too high in the sky to be a firework. Aircraft landing at IAH fly over the area also, but in a different direction. One person thought it could have been a helicopter, (he owns a large telescope and does lots of space photography) but there was absolutely no sound as the aircraft were making as they flew over and it definately was the color of glowing embers. It could have been an aircraft on fire it was so bright and the color the exact same as such. The object moved on a very straight path and eventally faded from view."],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2008 09:00 UTC","Case Number":"11463","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"29.969112","City":"Cypress","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Fire-colored noiseless sphere moving southwest to north."}
