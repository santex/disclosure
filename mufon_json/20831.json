As I turned to go around the car I saw a ball of light appear in the SSE sky. It was street light in color, very high up in the SSE sky, and lasted about 10 seconds. It disappeard followed by another one that appeared just to the right of it, and it lasted about 4 seconds and then it disappeared. When they appeared they did not move at all, they stayed in that exact position, so it wasn't a meteor, and it wasn't an airplane or helicopter because it was stationary. They kinda looked like flares from a military jet, but there were no planes in the area (we are in a pretty rural area). I got home about 5 minutes later and called the police station, but they told me no one else has called in about it. We do get military jets that fly down from Springfield and Wright-Patterson AFB, but again there were no planes in the sky (no clouds to block the view)."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.538671,+-83.429554(20831)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20831) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/01/2009 07:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","City":"Washington Court House","Latitude":"39.538671"}
