It made no sound. It appeared to follow a straight path at approx20 mph.Because the pasture is in a gulley and the house is on a small hill the objectwas just above eye level so we could see the side and bottom as it passeddirectly in front of us. When it had disappeared we ran in the house and toldmy God Mother who was in her mid to late fifties at the time. She said we werejust seeing things and dismissed it at that."],"Log Number":"","City":"Dundee","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"1444","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1444.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1444.html"],"Region":"Michigan","Summary":"Saucer emits light in Dundee, Michigan - 1957"}
