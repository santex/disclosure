It was dark and there was partial cloud cover. I noticed some lights to my left comming through the cloud cover. I though it odd that a plane would come down so low so I watched. The lights were unusual. They were too large to be plane lights and they didn't blink fast. There were two big white lights and one green light between and behind the white. The green one stayed on and the white ones binked slowly right then left. I pulled over to watch because it was so odd. It went right over me without making a sound. I drove the next 7 miles home really fast. When I got home my husband came out to meet me and I told him what I saw. As I was talking a loud military plane flew by pretty low. My husband commented on how low it was and that that was unusual in itself. It was headed in the direction I just came from."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.051121","Date of the Event":"11/12/2010 05:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11142010-0012","Longitude":"-122.909409","Summary":"Three Lights under clouds passed over me","Country":"United States","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26570.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26570.html"]}
