My Cousin and I had just finished eating dinner and playing a round of Golf. We were driving on a two lane road that leads back into the east side of our city. As we turned right at a corner that leads back into the main road, we drove another 100 feet until : on the right side of the road I saw a 8-9 foot figure that was walking back into the edge of the forest located under a street light. I immediately hit the brakes, unsure of what I saw, my cousin who was in the passenger seat looked as shocked as I was. I yelled ���I think that was an alien��� The car came to a stop and my cousin yelled ���Go Go Go !��� I sped up and my eyes were tearing up as I couldn���t believe what I had just seen, my cousin said ���I thought I was seeing things!��� I replied with ���No I saw it too!��� we drove to our apartment which is near by still shocked and startled I immediately called some friends. They came and picked me up and drove us back to the spot where I saw the figure. I explained what had happened to them, and when we drove back to the location some brush had looked to be parted where something had walked through it. I made the call to the NUFORC hotline next where a gentleman told me to make this report and call local authorities. The figure stood 8-9 feet tall , had a tall rounded crown shape head, the head was as big as a human abdomen, the figure was somewhat muscular looking, it had big eyes, but not stereotypical alien-like , long legs and it did not seemed startled whatsoever."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Flight Path":"N/A"}
