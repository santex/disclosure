In the sky on right side, I saw a fast moving ball of light going northward, seemingly descending downward. I thought it was a comet or shooting star. The color was not white white but slightly off-white. Then there was a red \"blip\" where most, not all of it flashed red, then it disappeared. Lasted for approx. 1 second. It seemed strange because it seemed that at the end of its trajectory it speeded up quite a bit the split second before it vanished. There was a major car accident several miles earlier, which had stopped interstate travel for about 1 hour."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"White light ball streaking down, then red, then gone.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15272.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15272.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"15272","City":"Franklin","Latitude":"36.726413","Region":"Kentucky","Date Submitted":"02/02/2009 08:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-02022009-0020","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.726413,+-86.569388(15272)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15272) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
