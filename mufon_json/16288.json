{"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"-111.921544","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn the middle of the night (1 or 2 am) my three dogs started barking hysterically in the room next to us. My husband woke up and checked out the house. Nothing appeared to be wrong so we went back to bed. We drifted off to sleep seconds later. About 5 minutes later I woke up and looked directly ahead of me. Something in me knew that there was something in front of me. As I looked, my master bathroom was lit up with a strange smokey blue light. I could see every detail in the bathroom. As I started to focus, the light immediately dimmed to darkness. It was as if whatever was lighting up the room knew that I was looking and was spooked off. Why were my dogs barking? Did they know something was there that shouldn't have been? I was scared and spooked. I put my head under the covers and didn't dare to look up again."],"Case Number":"16288","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"34.717799","Country":"United States","City":"Cornville","Tags":"City","Region":"Arizona","Date Submitted":"03/25/2009 01:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Cornville","There were no other sightings in Cornville on or around March 25th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-03282009-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.717799,+-111.921544(16288)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16288) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/25/2009 01:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Strange blue light shining down in bathroom.","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16288.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16288.html"],"Object Shape":"Other"}
