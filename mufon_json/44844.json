I was out in my front yard walking my dog when I first noticed it. I was just looking at the night sky as I usually do. It has occurred in various directions but is most noticeable to the northeast. The reason I first noticed it is because of it's unusual flight pattern & how bright it was. It is a cigar shaped (as close as I can tell) brightly lit pulsating with multiple colors. It follows no flight path. It moves in many odd directions & as far as I can tell it just goes upward extremely fast when it disappears. I immediately thought it was A UFO. Others have witnessed it as well. It is not a star as there is no visible star in that position of the sky. My thoughts during the first sighting were \"What the hell is that\"."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"44844","Country":"United States","City":"Kerrville","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Kerrville","There were no other sightings in Kerrville on or around December 2nd 2012"],"Summary":"Sightings over multiple days.
