{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe UFO was a delta shape with what could best be explained by the old V-8 emblems on classic cars, the forward section was a V shape with a neon blue light outlining it and inside the V section was a circular shape with a castleated design in the interior portion of it with a smaller circle inside this part, this was also lit up blue like the rest of the craft. The whole experience was totally silent. I didnt feel any effects from it except that it scared the living hell out of me."],"Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oklahoma","Latitude":"35.81453","Log Number":"US-03052011-0011","Case Number":"28107","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/15/1987 09:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/05/2011 02:08 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Stilwell","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-94.628555","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.81453,+-94.628555(28107)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28107) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28107.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28107_submitter_file1__Untitled.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28107.html"],"Summary":"was lying in the back yard at my uncles house with cousins when delta shaped object just lit up above us and flew silently for approximately 2 miles or so then all of a sudden just went out like a light when the switch is turned off.","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Stilwell"}
