(rt. 30 and cline). i was heading west on rt. 30, and i have a habit of looking at the sky for jet with chemtrails. i looked up and there was a jet without a chemtrail. out of nowhere from the south comes a big silver ball. it was headed toward the plane. it looked like it was going to smack right into the plane. (i was thinking that there would have to be at least 10 miles distance between them, but i'm not an air traffic controller or pilot, so what do i know). this silver ball was travelling pretty fast in comparison to the jet, but it passed right by it as it was traveling north. (i knew i was right, there was some distance between them). other than traffic in front of me, all i can see are tree lines to the north and south of rt. 30. now from the north, the silver ball reappears!!! i am telling the truth, so help us god. i now pulled over on rt. 30 and autin ave. the silver ball hit the jet!!! and continued going south. it went past the tree line again. at this point i thought the jet would just start spiraling out of control, but it didn't. i don't know how much time passed - 15-30 seconds, the silver ball came back out of the south headig north and simply engulfed\\encased the jet. i wanted to run out on rt. 30 and point this out, but that would have been just as crazy as what i saw. the next thing was pretty amazing. this huge silver ball which just engulfed a jet - are you ready for this - turned into the biggest star i had ever seen. september 12 around 6:30 p.m. is starting to turn to dusk. i sat there for about 5 minutes and there it sat, just shining like a huge bright star in the sky,very out of place for the time of day. i pulled out of the parking lot of the old alaskan pipeline bar, and proceeded to the mall just a couple of blocks down to order some chinese take-out. ran in, placed my order and ran back out to see what was going on. the big star was still there, but now there were two smaller stars on the horizon, all three formed a triangle. i stood against my car, trying to tell if they were falling further down the tree line. a woman came out of one of the stores in the mall, and i asked her to take a look at this huge bright shining star (very unusual in size, but also just at dusk). i asked her to see if she thought it was slowly falling in the sky. she actually stood there with me for about 3-4 minutes and said that it did look like it was falling. then i spooked her. i said something to the effect that we should have been expecting to see this yesterday, (meaning 9\\11). can you imagine what she would have done if i told her that 10 minutes earlier this star was a huge silver ball that traveled north, then south,(hitting a jet),then north again, engulfing the jet and turning into a big bright shining star, and the 2 smaller ones weren't there originally??? i then ran back in to get my take-out, headed back to the office, and thought i could view this from the second floor. couldn't see a thing. there was nothing on the news - ever - about this event!!!! the next day, (9\\13), i went to see a neighbor who \"knows the truth is out there\", to tell him all about this, but before i could get a word out, he told me his story from the previous day. (9\\12). it was about 11:00 a.m. and he walked out his front door. it faces east. he said he saw this huge silver ball and after watching it for awhile, it turned into a huge bright star. (he watched it for about a half-hour and had to be on is way. we live in merrillville, in. so what did we see? did anyone else see this? also, will someone please tell me that what i am seeing is a satellite. how do they move? i have been observing this \"star\" in the sw sky for almost 5 years. i think it's a satellite, because i see them in a lot of places in the sky. it's just that they do \"weird\" movements. they flash, as if signalling to each other, and when i was sitting out on my deck the first summer from 10p.m. till dawn, many a nights, every hour for about 5-7 minutes, they do weird manuveurs. they can do great 90 degree angles, spiral down, do circles and hoops. are those satellites? thanks"]}
