(i was only under the influence of the ussual nicotine buzz, and jaun quit drinking a couple of weeks ago) we watched it for a few minutes and observed niether any change in the position nor the intensity of the light for several minutes. it appeared to be composed of a highly reflective metallic substance, but i wouldn't make a bet on that assertion. it dissapeared abruptly after about 6 minutes, and i did not see any other lights. the sky was a deep, healthy shade of blue during the sighting, and there were no visible clouds in the vicinity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- march 16, 2007 i was lying alone in a field behind the barton springs pool at around 10 in the evening. the sky was clear, the moon was absent, and the stars were blazing. i noticed what appeared to be a satelite, directly above me, moving in a direct line from the east\\northeast, toward the west\\southwest. soon after my eyes settled on the object, the light it \\reflected \\produced \\was composed of gradually became more intense, and within two or three seconds the object was by far the brightest object in the night sky. it was about a quarter of the size of the moon when the light reached maximum intensity. it began to dim immidiately, gradually, and it faded completely out of view within a few seconds. it moved very slowly, as if orbiting the earth. it moved at the exact speed of a sattelite. friends have conjectured that i may have seen the space station. i doubt it greatly. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- march 10, 2007 second sighting. barton hills. fixed point of silver light directly above, 1pm, partly cloudy. pointed it out to a lady who was a vollunteer worker on the trails near campbells hole in the barton creek greenbelt. she told me it was just venus. i told her to look again. she did, and was startled to find that a second stationary point of light, dimmer, had appeared about three degrees south of the first point. she then asked me what i thought they were up to. i told her i didn't know, but that i assumed they wanted us to know they were there. the lights disappearered shortly thereafter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- march 8th, 2007 first sighting. 10 am, barton springs pool. mostly clear sky, deep blue. fixed point of silver light. stared at it in wonder for over 20 minutes, then observed second stationary point of light appear very suddenly, directly beside the first. closed eyes, opened left, observed two lights. closed left, opened right. still two. not seeing double. excitement growing. second point disappears, reappers moments later, this time hovering around the first. i lost it, went running down the trail shouting ufo! ufo!"],"Latitude":"31.974909","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"02/09/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"9528","Tags":"City"}
