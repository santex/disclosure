{"Longitude":"-97.590967","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in the backyard letting the dog out and looking at the sky. I noticed the object because of the colors. I wondered what the oject could be. We have viewed this object for about a week with binoculars. It stays in the sky for hours at a time. It has multiple colors that seem to be along its perimeter...I would have to guess star-like or possibly circular...so I am not sure of the shape. I have taken a picture but do not have a floppy drive to see if anything will show up...I couldn't see the object in my viewfinder. I will re-post if the photo shows anything."],"Case Number":"12797","Summary":"Multicolored object in sky a little south and east of Tinker AFB","Latitude":"35.401415","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oklahoma","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.401415,+-97.590967(12797)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12797) map </A>","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/26/2008 08:01 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Oklahoma City","Date of the Event":"09/26/2008 08:01 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09262008-0017","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12797.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12797.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 78 other sightings in Oklahoma City","There were no other sightings in Oklahoma City on or around September 26th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
