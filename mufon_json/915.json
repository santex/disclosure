(this seemsrather unscientific in retrospect)the object faded with the distance it wascovering into the east. i was and am stunned. i tried to call the #800 but noone was there and felt ridiculous leaving a message.if anyone else reports thisor you figure out what it was please let me know."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/915.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/915.html"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.477242,+-88.09564(915)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (915) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/02/2000 06:13 UTC","Longitude":"-88.09564","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"915","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.477242","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Object over wisconsin/illinois","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date of the Event":"11/02/2000 06:13 UTC"}
