Too low to be an aircraft, too high to have come from the ground. Six of these orbs, spaced about 3 minutes apart, travled the EXACT same route. It was very very precise in it's movement. I have also seen them two other times in the late evening since the first sighting, including last night. Driving with a friend, and we were actually talking about them because her GRANDKIDS also saw them last week and took pictures. As we were talking I saw one in the sky. We pulled off the road and watched in wonderment as a total of 5, again precisely spaced apart, traveled in a northbound direction and then eventually disappeared from sight. We had also seen a single one earlier in the evening while at fireworks. Solid light, not blinking. I knew it was something I have NEVER seen before, and assumed it to be UFO in origin."],"Log Number":"US-07042013-0023","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48611.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48611.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Multiple, identical red & gold orbs traveling in a straight line","City":"Garden City","Latitude":"42.331716","Date of the Event":"06/20/2013 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.331716,+-83.306054(48611)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48611) map </A>","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Garden City","There were no other sightings in Garden City on or around June 20th 2013"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"48611","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City"}
