I noticed it because it wasn't flashing as a normal aircraft would. There was a flashing white light fallowing it then it just stopped flashing and I couldn't see it anymore. The green light made a straight line till it got out of sight behind some trees. Then a solid white light (not flashing)came back from where I last saw the green light and faded out of site as If it burned out. I saw this from Benton mo. Just south of cape girardeau. It was still dark outside but at the speed it was moving I would think it would have been close enough to hear if it was a plane or helicopter."],"Country":"United States"}
