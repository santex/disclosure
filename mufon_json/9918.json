{"Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsmy girlfriend and i were on our way home from the mall a couple of nights ago. we were laughing and singing along with the radio. i looked up into the sky and i saw a strange orange light. i felt almost hypnotized by it, then it disappeared. immediately i told myself that it was only a glare from a passing vehicle. as i was turning to ask my girlfriend if she saw anything. she was actually turning to ask me the same thing. so was a loud, simultaneous, \"did you see that!!?\" now skeptical, but still thinking logical, i assumed it was a cloud passing over a bright star. or even a planet. that's when i looked and about 3\\4 mile northwest of the initial observation. i saw another one and then another right next to it. each time one appeared... one disappeared in a timed sequence, and in a perfect, counter clockwise circular motion.hovering, and like a domino effect. now intrigued, i frantically rolled down my window despite the cold winter air. just when i thought it was gone another sequence would appear. each time it appeared to multiply or pulsate, and always in a perfect sequence. there were never more than three lights in each one. i saw a total of three individual sequences on the way home, (like a 5 minute time period). when we got back to the house my girlfriend was trying to convince me that it was probably a helicopter or something. it wasn���t. so now we're standing in the driveway waiting on these things to show up again. it didn���t take long for them to appear. this time there are 2 sequences in the sky at once about a mile apart from each other, (she no longer thinks its a helicopter), and we can barely see super small twinkling lights in between each pulse. i also noticed that there were suddenly several of the small twinkling lights all over the western sky, moving in random directions. some fast some slow. some times disappearing\\appearing. i noticed a low distant rumbling during the sequences. like an engine, or explosion, or breaking barrier. every dog in the neighborhood was barking. just as fast as the show started, it ended. i personally cant think of a logical explanation. fireworks? in the winter, with no sound, and in 2 different parts of the western sky... doubt it. maybe a flare? why? and how so timed in 2 different areas? could be a hoax... but someone would have to have a lot of time on there hands because i did some research on this today. i discovered several, damn near, to the \"t\", same observation as me. not only that, they were in different years and in different locations. something else i noticed in my findings is these sightings almost always occur in the western sky."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.493677","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/06/2008 07:30 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Case Number":"9918","Log Number":"US-03132008-0001","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Orange/Amber colred pulsating lights","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere, Star-like","trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in Kokomo","There were 2 other sightings in Kokomo on or around March 6th 2008"],"Longitude":"-86.129003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.493677,+-86.129003(9918)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9918) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9918.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9918.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/06/2008 07:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other,Unknown","City":"Kokomo"}
