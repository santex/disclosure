We were just in front of the Cove Hotel around 7pm and there weren't maby people around specially because everything was closed.The object was norh of us above the sea.At first it looked like na airplane breaking the speed of sound but he pictures are very weird. We also asked and people told us that the army bases were very far away and in the opposite direction. We filmed also but it was very dark so I didn't attach it. Does anyone know what this could be.."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.06506,+-77.3424(48313)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48313) map </A>","Summary":"Weird seighting in Atlantis towers","Case Number":"48313","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Tags":"City","Log Number":"BS-06212013-0023","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Nassau","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"05/24/2013 07:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New Providence","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48313.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48313.html"],"Country":"Commonwealth of The Bahamas","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Nassau","Date Submitted":"06/21/2013 10:36 UTC","Longitude":"-77.3424"}
