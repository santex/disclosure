At first I thought nothing of it since our house isin the flight path of a nearby small airport. The sound got so loud it seemed as if a plane was going to crash into my house or a rocket was blsating off, which cuased me to look out my back door. When I looked outside there was a large disc shaped object which lit up as I stared in horror. I stared at the object in shock for about 10 seconds, and the ran to my parents room, shreaking about what I saw. It was so surreal, like something from a movie. The craft appeared to be a dark metallic object, not silver more like black. It was shaped like 2 plates put together with the top half scalloped like a coffee filter. There was a ring of rotating lights around the center of the craft, 2 colors that stood out were yellow and blue."],"Date of the Event":"11/01/2009 09:54 UTC","Case Number":"20264","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.106622,+-95.610005(20264)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20264) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11022009-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20264.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20264.html"]}
