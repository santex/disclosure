I am glad he did it because after 30 minutes passed I saw one moving star-like object, I thought it was an airplane so I made a joke with my family and told them to look at the sky to see UFO, we all look up to sky and every one of us saw that the object moved from south to north and lost the shiny light slowly and disappeared. We were trying to find out what it was, 30 second later we heard rumbling noise from the clear sky. We thought Atlantis might be ready to land in but when I checked the NASA webpage I learn that it is schedule to be land on Thursday. I checked all the other news to see if anyone noticed this strange object and rumbling noise, I couldn't find anything. If it wasn't the rumbling noise or 15 second of sighting I would say it could be either meteor or falling star, but I don't think any of them could make that noticeable rumbling noise."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Hoax","Date Submitted":"07/19/2011 11:34 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
