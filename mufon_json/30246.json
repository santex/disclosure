On Saturday night, July 2, 2011, at about 9:40 p.m., reporting witness saw an orange, glowing object for an estimated 25 SECONDS, which looked angular on one side (see sketch attached), at about 60 degrees up as she drove E on an E-W street in her town of approx. 9,500 population. The next night her daughter-in-law contacted her to say that several family members who'd gotten together on Sunday night, 7-3-11, discovered that they'd all seen something from their various locations in surrounding communities the night before for SEVERAL MINUTES, but the daughter-in-law reported that what they saw was WHITE, not orange and glowing, as seen by this reporting witness. Also, their sightings were at 9:30 p.m., which appears to indeed match the passage of the International Space Station (ISS) as seen from that area, but does not explain what was seen by this reporting witness. Witness lost sight of object because of surrounding vegetation. After arriving home, she now thinks it's odd that she forgot about it until the next night when her daughter-in-law texted her re the various family members having seen something from various locations in surrounding communities. (INVESTIGATOR NOTE: Reporting witness' \"forgetting\" the incident until the next night is what is known in UFO research as an INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIGH STRANGENESS.)"],"Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
