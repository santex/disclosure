Sitting on my friend's porch with her and her husband, looking northeast, I see a slow moving \"shooting star\" going southwest and say so. It disappears behind a tree, both her and hubby say they missed it. I spot it again on the other side of the large tree, point it out, they see it. Friend says it looks like a bug but then it goes behind a tall light transformer and changes all of our perspectives of what we were seeing. Coming out from the tree outline to begin with was now heading evenly northwest. It was moving slow enough for us to talk about it as we were watching it. It was moving out of our sight distance when suddenly it changed direction again to the direct north and finally went out of our sight, fading in light. And so it was gone. 2. Thought it was a shooting star. 3. See above. 4. See first answer. 5. Incredulous at what we were seeing. 6. It moved out of our sight distance."],"trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed"}
