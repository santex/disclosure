No sighting, but when I checked again at 8:45PM, the triangle was in, in the same place, only it seemed brighter and closer. It was harder to see because the next door neighbor, who had accompanied me the night before, had all his exterior lights on, unusually, so perhaps he was 'spooked'. I checked again at 9:00PM, it was still there, but at 9:15, it was gone. It didn't move at all during the viewings. As it keeps appearing in the same place, I am wondering if it isn't something orbiting. I will keep checking each evening. During the sighting I felt calm but surprised it was there again. This morning, again, I felt exhausted, and kept misdialing phone numbers at work. I feel as if my thinking is slightly impaired. My body still feels heavy and exhausted. I am aware of no missing time."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"04/20/2010 08:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-04202010-0011","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.681653,+-116.775606(22910)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22910) map </A>","Longitude":"-116.775606","Region":"Idaho","Summary":"For the third time, I saw the triangle from my back porch in the same location only closer, as it was larger this time.","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
