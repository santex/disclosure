I looked off to the west at a ridge line where the sun sets. I noticed a bright light just to the left of the ridge. At first I thought it might be venus, and I was going to get my telescope. As I watched the light it was moving to the right towards the ridge. But it did not follow the same path as the other stars in the sky. I watched for about two minutes, then I decided to climb up on my porch roof to bet a better view. As I did this the light rolled behind the ridge, but I could still see the light of the object. I climbed down and looked back to the ridge I saw the light roll back over the ridge towards me. I watched for about a minute and the object shot over the ridge and out of sight. From that point I could not see the light from the craft any longer. As I watched this object I thought as it moved this is no star or planet, its not a plane or helicopter. As it was dark and about 60 degrees I heard no noise of engines or rotors."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.956798","City":"South Cairo","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.277031","trends":["There have been no other sightings in South Cairo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"25019","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"08/08/2010 01:10 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/07/2010 09:00 UTC","Region":"New York","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08082010-0013"}
