{"Country":"United States","divs":["sighting detailsi was driving on a residential street in ne portland headed west. i was driving slowly as the sun had just set and i was unfamiliar with the neighborhood. without looking up - so it was in my line of view- i saw three lights in the sky. they were a bright white\\yellowish, round, and evenly spaced. at this point i was so surprised that i almost completed stopped the car and i could not take my eyes off of the lights. i had two thoughts in my head, \"i have to take a picture of this\" and \"it must be a plane\". i pulled the car over and stopped. the lights were getting closer but moving slowly and seemed to be too low to the ground. i could see the shape of some kind of craft but it was dark and this was difficult. i believe it was very large. mainly i was trying to determine if it was a standard airplane. although i don't know the exact shape, i know it was not the shape of a commercial airliner. as the lights became larger and closer they moved from a horizontal position to a vertical position. now, as i am recalling this, the rest is a little fuzzy although everything i have already typed is crystal clear. it moved over me and i turned my head to look out of the drivers side window. i looked up and saw a red light underneath. now i began rationalizing again that it must be a plane since i have seen a red light on planes. now i heard a noise similar to an engine sound but quieter, like a \"whoosh\". now it moved faster away from me but still in my field of view. i believe it was gaining elevation now. now that i think about it, i can not think of why i decided to look away. i believe i looked away while it was still visible to me which is strange because i would have wanted to watch it until it disappeared from view. like i said before, the end of this experience was a little fuzzy and almost became dreamlike. i was excited after seeing this and realized i was rationalizing in my head \" it must have been a plane getting ready to land\", etc. although i really knew it wasn't and i had seen a ufo. i feel a little confused about how calm i remained (although initally shocked) and especially how the end seemed to be unclear to me in what happened."],"Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were no other sightings in Portland on or around January 4th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"01/08/2011 05:20 UTC","Longitude":"-122.673717","Region":"Oregon","Summary":"Three round horizontal lights, evenly spaced on large object moving slowing and low on the horizon.
