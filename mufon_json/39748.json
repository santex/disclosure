{"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/20/2012 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile this is still fresh in my memory, NJ and I were standing outside smoking a cigarette. I was looking up like I always do at night and saw towards the northwest a solid light. I yelled at NJ and said what is that!!! It flew towards us staying solid white. NJ said that's a plane, and I said no way, no flashing lights, and way to low to be a satellite. Then right when it got above us, it started to fade, and then disappeared completely, and not a cloud in the sky. Truly like nothing I have seen in the sky since we bought this house, and I say that because every night I look up. This is what I posted that night on face book. I had the feeling that it truly was something I could not explain, and sort of an eerie calm in the air. Almost like it saw us looking, and decided to disappear. I look up almost every night, and can easily spot satalytes. By no means was this a satalyte or plane, very strange. I actually saw almost the same thing last night, a lot quicker, and moving the opposite direction."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Date Submitted":"06/23/2012 08:02 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39748.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39748.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.933211,+-77.544585(39748)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39748) map </A>","Longitude":"-77.544585","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06232012-0020","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.933211","Case Number":"39748","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Fayetteville","There were no other sightings in Fayetteville on or around June 20th 2012"],"Summary":"See post below, which is what I posted to my facebook page that night.","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Fayetteville","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
