As I walked towards the driveway that led to the parking lot, I saw 2 orange balls of light traveling towards me, from over Geneva Lake, at Williams Bay. They were traveling slowly towards me, I kept listening for copter blade noise, but there was none. I then thought the glowing brilliant orange globes are larger then a helicopter would be, so I felt very perplexed what it was , I was seeing. The orange balls of light then made a 90��� turn, and continued to move away from me until I could no longer see them . I was astonished at how blazing orange they were, and left wondering what I had just seen."],"Date Submitted":"11/13/2013 05:07 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Wisconsin","Tags":"City","Summary":"Two orange balls of light travelled towards me, making no noise.
