{"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"44.73643","divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw this ufo at about 2200 local and as I type this is now 0031 and just left to come inside and it was still there in the sky. It hovered and had very irratic movements. I had to see if I could get it on my camera and I did. shot about 14min of video of the craft. I was taking out the trash to the cans in the ally when I noticed the light in the sky. I noticed it because I thought is was a planet as it was the brightest thing in the sky. The object was round as far as I could see or disk, hard to say my glasses make light look like starbursts. I felt very excited as I saw how this object moved and was not sure I saw it move like fast in a short spirt, untill it did that again. The object was still in the sky when I came inside."],"Summary":"saw what looked like a planet then the light move fast and irratic","Log Number":"US-10012011-0003","Date of the Event":"09/30/2011 10:21 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.73643,+-108.747276(32242)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32242) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Powell","There were no other sightings in Powell on or around September 30th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"10/01/2011 02:39 UTC","Longitude":"-108.747276","Region":"Wyoming","Case Number":"32242","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32242.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32242.html"],"City":"Powell","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Disposition":"IFO"}
