We initially thought the light was a tower or a plane, but it moved enough not to be a tower and when it did move, it moved too quickly and directionally to be a plane. After about 35 minutes, it was no longer there. I moved from one window to the front porch and back to the window and when I moved back to the window, it had disappeared. I do not know if it was because clouds moved in fron of it or not....at this point the clouds are still there."],"Latitude":"44.899409","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
