The object made no sound and displayed a light cycle of gradual illumination (the entire object was glowing white when illuminated) for about 3 seconds and then a gradual fade to complete black for exactly 5 seconds. Sighting time was just a little over a minute or so, but it's the second one I've seen like this since July.
