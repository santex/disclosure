At first my wife thinks its just a shooting star or perhaps a plane but it didn't have any of those characteristics. as she tells me to take out my camera it descends into the neighborhood and can't find any further evidence of it. we drive to a better vantage point and see a helicopter about 10 miles NE of us hovering as if monitoring the sky a red dot appears next to it i look away for a moment thinking it was just another helicopter i look back and the red dot is gone nowhere to be found. This was far too low flying to be anything that man would be flying plane or helicopter, made us totally intrigued to go looking for it. it seemed like it landed in the neighborhood and we couldn't see it anymore."],"Case Number":"48343","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-06232013-0005","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.651369","Longitude":"-112.005692","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Utah","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Kearns","There were no other sightings in Kearns on or around June 22nd 2013"],"City":"Kearns"}
