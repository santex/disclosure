Then it started to slowly move to the eats again. I ran inside and grabbed my mom and my uncle. We all watched it float away before it just vanished somewhere over USD college. I got a really good look at it thru my binoculars for about 1 minute. No sound. Hovered, then moved, changing directions. Looked like molten fire was dripping off of it as it flew slowly by. I didnt want to run and grab my camera in fear that it would go away."],"Date Submitted":"02/01/2013 04:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Longitude":"-119.411092","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45514.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45514.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Latitude":"36.785231","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"11/17/2012 07:51 UTC","Case Number":"45514","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":[],"Summary":"Black solid egg shape with orange lights on the bottom"}
