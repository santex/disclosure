{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAwoke at 3:10 AM to go to the bathroom and get a drink of water. Heard a loudhumming - like a fan on its highest speed. Saw a bright white light outside andwent out to look. Saw a triangular pattern of lights (7?) apparently on theunderside of something large moving acroos the sky. Lights went out, flickeredgreen, then flashed on green. Then went off for 2 seconds, then flickered red,then went on red. I went in the house to wake my wife but she only heard thehumm - it had cleared the treeline by then. Later in the morning (aroundnoontime) I observed a single black helicopter cruising around, then two moreflying in formation. Dont know if its related or not"],"Date of the Event":"07/27/2002 03:10 UTC","Case Number":"1773","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1773.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1773.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"New Hampshire","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Goffstown","There were no other sightings in Goffstown on or around July 27th 2002"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Summary":"triangular shaped collection of lights","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.022045,+-71.592842(1773)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1773) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Goffstown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Latitude":"43.022045","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/27/2002 03:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-71.592842"}
