Down the road( we were driving) it happened again, but only two and three lights. They were not flares or fireworks- in a straight line, appearing and burning out. I am a news reporter and posted a blog on our web site (www.statesboroherald.net) and people replied, stating they saw this as well. A woman from Screven County called after seeing this blog and told me a very interesting encounter her and her son had with the same kind of lights, but forming in lines and a v-shaped, and appearing to form a light show."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6273.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6273.html"],"Log Number":"US-01302007-0008","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Georgia"}
