{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile observing the airshow aerial demonstrations, I noted 4 white spherical shaped objects in exact formation (side by side) moving east to west far above the city. The objects were white on the bottom, with some black at the top. I was able to get a quick glimpse through my binoculars to make sure these were not other planes, or some type of birds. They were neither. The objects then vanished. I contacted the local national weather service office to inquire as to whether they had released any weather balloons, and they had not. Also, when they do release a weather balloon, it is a single balloon, not four. There were two other persons near my location, and when I approached them and asked if they had seen anything unusual, they described the same objects I noted. These objects were approx 7500 feet up."],"Case Number":"18849","Longitude":"-94.570567","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 3 other sightings in Kansas City on or around August 23rd 2009"],"Object Features":"None","Region":"Missouri","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Kansas City","Tags":"City","Summary":"4 white globes in formation moving east to west","Object Shape":"Sphere, Teardrop","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.103876,+-94.570567(18849)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18849) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.103876","Date of the Event":"08/23/2009 02:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-08242009-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18849.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18849.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/23/2009 02:20 UTC"}
