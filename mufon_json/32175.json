{"Summary":"Oblong blue shimmering starlike, high and quick","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"IFO","divs":["Sighting DetailsDate 9-11-2011 Time aprox. 9:00 pm Place Erwin Park Full moon that night. I was flying my rc airplane. I have blue and red leds outlining the plane so I can fly it in the dark. The plane was getting a little too far away for me to see in the dark so I brought it back closer. I was flying it almost straight up above my head . At the time I was following it from the west side of me to the east side of me. As I was watching the plane I saw a blue oblong star-like object going the same direction as my plane. It was traveling quite fast. It was about a magnitude three in brilliance. It fluctuated in brilliance. kind of shimmering. I landed the plane as quickly as I could, this took only a few seconds. When I looked up to find the blue light I could no longer see it. Just guessing at about passenger jet high or higher. Sighting approximately seven seconds. I've never seen a blue object traveling through the sky before."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/29/2011 01:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.254632,+-96.65603(32175)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32175) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/11/2011 09:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"McKinney","Longitude":"-96.65603","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in McKinney","There were no other sightings in McKinney on or around September 11th 2011"],"Case Number":"32175","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09292011-0005","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32175.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32175.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval","Latitude":"33.254632"}
