I caught a glimpse of light to the east and saw quite a few flashing lights in a random pattern. It only lasted a few seconds, long enough to ask my son if he saw it too. As soon as he acknowledged he had, they disappeared. It was like they were never there, it was a clear night with no cloud cover. We were in awe, and were confused by what we saw. But excited at the same time."],"Longitude":"-108.583466","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.354033","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Cortez","There were no other sightings in Cortez on or around January 6th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-01112012-0010","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"34789","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Several blinking lights in a random pattern","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.354033,+-108.583466(34789)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34789) map </A>","Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/11/2012 02:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
