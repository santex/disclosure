I went out to my porch and stared at it for a minute. I then got my phone to see if I could video it, but it seemed too high and too dark for me to video it on my iPhone. When it reached directly above I went into the house and came out to see it on the south side of my apartment. I watched as the light faded into the atmosphere and disappeared. Pretty sure it wasn't a plane because I am always looking at the night sky and know what most of them look like. I have very little emotional reaction other than some excitement to see what I saw."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.249912,+-121.864531(50252)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50252) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/28/2013 08:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"50252","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-121.864531","Object Shape":"Fireball","Latitude":"37.249912","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"San Jose","Date Submitted":"08/28/2013 11:47 UTC","Log Number":"US-08282013-0031"}
