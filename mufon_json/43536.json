{"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10262012-0010","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was leaving home at 6:15 while still dark and was looking at the dark sky i figured I would try to take a picture of the sky when I saw a shooting star going away from the big dipper. Bit bigger than a star but smaller and less bright than Venus. When it stopped pulsated and changed its path back to the big dipper where it stayed around the dipper handle. Then it started moving away in its previous direction. Not fast, slowly from my point fo view, I could imagine the velocity required to cover that distance would be incredible. As it moved away from the handle I lost it, and the camera is all black."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Alhambra","There were no other sightings in Alhambra on or around October 26th 2012"],"City":"Alhambra","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.103887","Date Submitted":"10/26/2012 01:32 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"43536","Date of the Event":"10/26/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-118.119115","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Summary":"starlike pulsating light moving away from upside down big dipper and then returning to it","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43536.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43536.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.103887,+-118.119115(43536)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43536) map </A>"}
