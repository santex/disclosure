I looked up into the shy and i say a black circular disc moving from the southeast to the northwest. At first sight i thought it was a balloon, but it did not ascend at all, it was gliding like a jet, below the clouds. It looked like a hockey puck, but as it was so far away, it was much larger than that. There were no lights, and we followed it until it left our sight in front of the San Bernardino Mountains"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
