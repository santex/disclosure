It was traveling North initially. It moved approximately a quarter mile after my initial sighting and as it approach me I could see there was a disk-shaped side to it. It then turned 90 degrees in a disciplined fashion and continued on for a short distance and changed another 90 degrees and then it wasn't visible since the light beam was now behind the craft and it wasn't seen again. During the same evening I observed approximately 6 - 7 star-like color shifting objects in the sky. These were all distributed fairly evenly in a circle about the size of 100 square miles. These are stationary and flicker Blue, red, green, white purple etc. These do not move and are not geosynchronous. They are easily discernible from surrounding stars and a visible planet this night."],"Object Features":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31373.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31373.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-09012011-0002","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.909335,+-73.021516(31373)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31373) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/31/2011 09:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/01/2011 01:29 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Mt Sinai","There were no other sightings in Mt Sinai on or around August 31st 2011"]}
