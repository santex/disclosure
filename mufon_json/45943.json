{"City":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsi went outside to have a smoke around 8:15 p.m. on 2\\26\\2013 and noticed what appeared to be landing lights from an aircraft. depending on the direction of the wind, commercial aircraft fly directly over my house on final approach. since this occurs on a daily basis, i didn't give it a lot of thought. the light dimmed and went out, as though it passed through a cloud. again, i really didn't think that much of it due to the frequency. i glanced away for only a moment and when i returned to the original position,the light was present again. but much brighter this time. again, i dismissed it as a commercial airliner. there were no aircraft in the area. period. i watched the light for a few seconds and it, for the lack of a better word, \"spawned\" another light. now there are two objects at the same altitude that seemed to hover in the air with no detectable lateral movement. i was intrigued by this and continued to watch the lights. perhaps 10 seconds elapsed and each light simultaneously \"spawned\" another light. one to the left and one to the right. now there are four objects. two slightly higher and outboard of the original lights. another five or six seconds later, they \"spawned\" yet again for a total of six lights. three on the left and three on the right that appeared to form right triangles. i watched the formation for maybe 10 seconds as it moved slightly to my right and then disappear. i watched the sky for about five minutes longer, but the objects did not reappear. i was exhilarated but perplexed. i wanted to get my daughter outside to see this, but she was in the shower and could not hear me calling. i hope to see these lights again!!!"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"33.843441","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"South Carolina","Case Number":"45943","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45943.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45943.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/26/2013 08:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/27/2013 04:12 UTC","Longitude":"-81.161924","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Observed single light, then multiple lights in night sky.","Log Number":"US-02272013-0012","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":[],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.843441,+-81.161924(45943)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45943) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
