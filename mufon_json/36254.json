{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting outside on the lounge of a club at the Hardrock Casino in Hollywood Florida when I saw the object. I starred at the object moving from the east near the beaches to the west thinking at first it was another airplane from the nearby Ft.lauderdale airport but quickly realized it was not a plane. It was flying steady with a blue light that seemed to be spinning with the object. It did not have the usual flashing tail and wing lights like so many airplanes that land at the nearby airport. It did not have any spinning blades nor did it have a rear tail light and seemed to be moving to fast for a helicopter. I have always looked up at the planes to see if I could witness a UFO but they all have the same four lights,this did not have those key features. I am posting this sighting so others that may have seen it will have some comfort in knowing they are not alone in what they saw. The experience is surreal but I know it was a UFO I spotted last night."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"03/04/2012 11:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.050339,+-80.210958(36254)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36254) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Hollywood","Latitude":"26.050339","Case Number":"36254","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36254.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36254.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-03042012-0017","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-80.210958","Summary":"Object spinning with blue light but no wings and no helicopter blades.
