It did not fade out but quickly disappeared. I noted there were no fireworks going off and nothing else out of the ordinary. My friend thought I was crazy until we found out other individuals had seen the same thing. Checked out Heavens above and did not see any listings for satellite visibility at the time. Unfortunately it was too quick for me to snap a photo with my phone."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.449507,+-112.069777(22105)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22105) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/03/2010 12:01 UTC","Latitude":"33.449507","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-03032010-0006","Sighting Duration":"00:00:06","Region":"Arizona","Country":"United States","Case Number":"22105","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-112.069777","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Round bright green light drops from sky then vanishes"}
