{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailswhile working in qatar between 1996 and 1999 i used to go running in the desert behind my residence. i used to run most evenings and most days. my work meant i was out there for about 2.5y so i was very familiar with as an area of about a 5 to 6 mile radius. my runs took me past a series of buildings and then to an area of the desert that stone, brick and other markers were used to identify plots of approximatly 100m square which eventially gave way to the subka-desert beyond. the 'normal' run area was bound by a road to an electrical substation at the bottom, a gas pipeline under a raised section to the left (probably west) and the start of the e ringroad in the east. one evening something appeared in a very strange place, in view of the nearest building, but hidden from all the roads. it was on the nearest side of a small rise. the next bit of this trys to explain as best i can what occured next and sounds a little odd so bear with me! i am not even sure that it registered with me that it was there origially because it resisted both recognition and visual review. over a period of time (probably a week or so) i fought to look at it from a distance of over 100m(possibly more). i am not too sure how long it was actually there but it was probably the best part of a month, and over this time i gradually broke the mental barriers down to eventually manage to run around it (again at at least 100m distance). the following description is the summation of half-looks and a gradually formed picture. the 'thing' was silver, such that it reminded me of the final section of a building recently constructed on the far side of the e ringroad. i did suspect at one point that it was some kind of optical illusion and was in fact the top of the building. it seemed to be circular (though i could only see it from a side elevation), and it was at a slight angle to the horizontal, a similar angle to the rise but not evidently the same angle (i know its odd). it was not supported by any visible structure but was clearly some 3 to 4ft off the ground, and to be located where it was would have been excessively difficult because of the immendatly surronding terrain. there were much easier places to put it if there had been a choice, and, for instance a crane had been used or a trailor. the object actually looked a little like a 'traditional' saucer being raised in its central section, but it also had raised areas, almost as high as the centre section, some were definatly square but others were less easy to identify, all were solidly attached, and all were silver seeming continuous with the rest of the surface. there were no obvious seams or windows or entrances. it diameter was probably 35 to 45ft and its height at the centre was probably 20-25ft. i would not describe it as aerodynamic. then one day i realised the object had gone, i am not too sure i noticed the precise day it left but it took me about a week after the realisation to go and have a look in detail at the area. this, even after this time, took a lot of determination and for some weeks after i was very uneasy about the area. there had been no rain or winds to hide anything but there was absolutly no trace of the object, its supporting structure, or the possiblility of it having been take away on a trailor or similar. i also checked against areas i knew had been used and confirmed this observation. during this time it never crossed my mind to tell anybody else (it was almost as though i forgot it was there when i left its immediate presence and there was a deep reluctance to even consider it) and unusually i did not see anybody else in the area (which upon reflection was probably even more strange). the only reason i even remembered this incident was because i wrote the first account about a week after it dissappeared. this whole incident was forgotten until sometime in 2002\\3 when something on the radio (to do with hitchikers guide) brought it back to me and i looked and found a copy. the odd thing is that i actually forgot the whole incident completly inbetween and it was only the accout that allowed me to recall. i cannot explain the object but it is as much the surreal aspect of the whole episode that worries me to this day. just to clarify i did not see anything or anybody anywhere near the object and as mentioned earlier i seemed to be the only person around which was unlikely. the actual location is about 1 mile from the end of the airport runway!"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Other","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Doha","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"I struggled to observe an object on the ground over a period of about a month.
