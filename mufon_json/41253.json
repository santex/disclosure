I then looked at the skies. Staring at the clear dark skies i noticed a pulsating stationary object with dfferent colors pulsating. it wasnt a plane or a star. then it just dissappeared until i saw another object with an angle of 80 degrees moving really slow with a faint light, as it was traveling west towards the ocean, it shot some kind of projectile that looked like a flare. I KNOW IT WASNT A FLARE. 1)when it was first shot it looked like sparks propelled at great speeds.2)It maintained velocity.3)the projectiled behaved like gravity nor Air gave it any resistance for the maneuvers it displayed. after the craft shot the \"projectile\" the craft easily travelled more than 1000mph in a blink of an eye."],"Date of the Event":"07/28/2012 11:20 UTC"}
