She asked me to get my camera and come look at this thing in the sky. I stepped out the house and off in the distance was an orange ball of light. We went to another neighbors yard to get a closer look at it. I knocked on his door and told him what we were dong in his yard, and he came out too. The three of us stood there and watched this object for about 1 hour and then it started wobbling right to left and then up and down. I really didn't know what to think when i saw it so me and my friend just watched it. About 2 hours and 30 mins. went by and we were able to watch it go down behind the trees. We will be watching for it again tonight, because this is the second time we have see this object in the skys over the feild."],"Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"11/10/2008 07:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering,Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13662.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13662.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-76.248316","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Elizabeth City","There were no other sightings in Elizabeth City on or around November 10th 2008"],"Case Number":"13662","Date Submitted":"11/10/2008 07:30 UTC"}
