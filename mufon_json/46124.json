I thought it might be a helicopter as I live close to a hospital that receives alot of air-lifts. After a few minutes it seemed to move further away and continued to cast a mulitude of colors and seemed to change in shape and size. I grabbed my nikon and set it in a stationary position and adjusted the settings to night and shot a few photos. The photos didn't show much until I zoomed in and to my surprise I had captured what I thought appeared to be very interesting. Included are the photos I took. If the photos cannot be magnified when you view them let me know and I can try to blow-up the images and repost."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.990033,+-122.21568(46124)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46124) map </A>","City":"Everett","Country":"United States","Latitude":"47.990033","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46124.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46124.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Reflecting light of multiple colors.
