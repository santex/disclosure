I've made reports previously but have not had a good enough camera to film at night. I borrowed my mother-in-laws Canon DC420 and was able to get the footage attached to this report. The camera records directly to a mini dvd. I converted the *vob file to an *.avi so anyone could view the file, but the original is a little clearer. I have a total of about 40 minutes of footage so far but am only uploading just a few minutes worth due to the size of the file."],"Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","City":"Claremore","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Claremore","There were no other sightings in Claremore on or around July 3rd 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"30605","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.254325,+-95.706348(30605)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30605) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08032011-0049","Summary":"UFO Changing colors in the sky.","Date of the Event":"07/03/2011 12:00 UTC"}
