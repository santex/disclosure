I like to watch all the airplanes that fly over on there way to the airport and noticed a very bright star in the sky. I soon realized it was moving towards me in a northen direction. I noticed a plane on its way to land at the airport and how close the round ball of light was geeting to the plane. I thought they were going to collide as they crossed paths almost directly over head. There were no flashing lights or strobes as aircraft have and I did not hear any sound. The object then made a 90 deg turn towards the East and I lost site of it over the mountian. It did not seem to be moving very fast but sure was not like anything I have noticed before, my first thought was UFO."],"Latitude":"47.544799","Case Number":"25218","City":"Newcastle","Date Submitted":"08/28/2010 06:14 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.544799,+-122.153517(25218)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25218) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25218.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25218.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
