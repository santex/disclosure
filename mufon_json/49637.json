At first we didnt think much of it because there are sometimes helicopters flying in the area. But what caught our attention was that the object appeared to be low to the ground, right above tree tops and had no sound coming from it. Usually helicopters make a lot of noise so we were both very surprised and stunned at the same time. We looked right at it as it hovered slowly aboved us with a few lights blinking. I told my girlfriend to turn around so we can take a picture of it and as we were turning it just took off with an amazing speed, and it was gone just like that."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.687134","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"49637","Date Submitted":"08/09/2013 02:26 UTC","Latitude":"26.117105","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
