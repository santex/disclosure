I looked up and caught the cigar shape. It was very high and much larger than an airliner. If I put my index finger and thumb up it would have been 1.5 inches between my fingers. Several students watched it for two minutes and then it stopped, blinked on and off several times and then vanished. I have seen many B2 Bombers and jets fly over. This was too fast and large for that. No wings. Very white and long. Like nothing I have ever seen before."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cigar","Latitude":"37.614484","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Glowing White Cigar Shape","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Bolivar","There were no other sightings in Bolivar on or around April 8th 2010"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/08/2010 03:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22709.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22709.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/08/2010 02:10 UTC","Case Number":"22709","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04082010-0010","Object Features":"None","Region":"Missouri"}
