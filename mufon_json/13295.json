I struggled with this memory for many years until about 5 years ago i was watching a show on crop circles and they had caught a orb on video, i about fell over because it looked just like what i had seen when i was younger. i do know that back in the late 70s there were a rash of sightings in the suburbs around portland Oregon."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.45277,+-122.635671(13295)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13295) map </A>","Longitude":"-122.635671","Case Number":"13295","Latitude":"45.45277","Date Submitted":"09/21/1977 12:00 UTC","Region":"Oregon","City":"Milwaukie","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"i watched an orange glowing orb following the fence line in my backyard.","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Milwaukie","There were no other sightings in Milwaukie on or around September 21st 1977"],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13295.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13295.html"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-10282008-0011","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
