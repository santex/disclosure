{"Case Number":"40591","City":"Northglenn","divs":["Sighting DetailsI live in Denver Colorado, I saw something on the 4 th of July I can't explain. We were watching fireworks in the night sky I think it was 9:15 or 9:30 I stopped to notice a orange bright ball in the night sky. I looked towards my wife and said hey you see that thing. It didn't change position. It was a bright reddish gold ball. I then walked from the front door to the back door to the deck. That's when it got really interesting. The light began moving and then another ball would pop in out of nowhere .���they began moving rapidly more came into phase then there were five balls in the sky making what appeared to be circular trajectory with comet tails then fading in and out then they took off straight down in unison out of sight over the tree line. This was not fireworks, this was not a plane or helicopter. It happened and I can't explain it. The worst part about it I can't find any information online or anywhere else who also witnessed it.���"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40591.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40591.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 09:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Latitude":"39.901022","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.901022,+-104.973407(40591)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40591) map </A>","Region":"Colorado","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"07/08/2012 04:12 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07082012-0011","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Summary":"This was not fireworks.","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Northglenn","There were no other sightings in Northglenn on or around July 4th 2012"],"Longitude":"-104.973407","Source":"MUFON"}
