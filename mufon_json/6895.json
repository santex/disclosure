(note: it's a very large, choppy lake, so no ripples would be visibly cast and were not mentioned, nor did she mention any bobbing in the chop). it stayed there for a number of seconds, then ascended slowly, accelerated, and ���shot straight up��� and out of sight. she spoke in a quiet tone and gave me the impression as if she was almost a little embarrassed to share the story, but again, casual about it. she ended the account by saying dismissively, ���i don���t know what it was.��� and dispensed a shrug. she did imply during this conversation that many of the employees have their own experiences. as she spoke, i got the impression that her attitude was that in this place with such a conspicuous, immersive, impossible-to-ignore sky that occasionally seeing something ���strange��� is just kinda bound to happen eventually if you work and live here. i know a 2nd-hand report is unusual and less than ideal, but this witness lives basically off the grid, and had no particular interest in the phenomenon, so i wanted to get it on record. in retrospect i wished i had pressed her for a little more detail, but didn���t think it was appropriate at the time. the previous night, while gazing at that crystal clear, star-blanketed dome that betrayed to us every single little chunk of trash parading above, i couldn���t help but think, ���well, if ufos are real and one got anywhere near this place, you sure as hell wouldn���t miss it.��� i think the unassuming, down to earth folks that work in this place are probably quite aware of that too."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6895.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6895.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"6895","Country":"Canada","Object Flight Path":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.760833,+-87.285556(6895)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6895) map </A>","Summary":"Large orange sphere decends to surface of wilderness lake","Date Submitted":"02/01/1999 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
