It has orange lights and they were bright. The next thing I know itlanded. So I stopped and was curious. Because I do believe inextra-terrestrials. So I got out and then it got out of the space ship. I wastrying to use telepathy to say I was wanting no harm. Just then it paralyzed meand I couldnt move. All I could do was stand. Then all of the sudden he took mewith great strength to his spaceship. I was there on a table next and I guessthey were probing me. It was unbelievable. Then the next thing I know was I wasin home and in bed. I thought I had dreamt it all but then the memories cameback to me 1 day later. I think they put something in my nose but Im not quitesure.
