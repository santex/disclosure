At the time I took the photo, neither I nor my traveling partner noticed the UFO object. I do not believe it was visible to the naked eye. If it had been, we would have surely noticed it. We were both facing the mountain range. We did not hear any sounds either. The photo was taken with a digital camera in mid-afternoon. The sky was a little hazy and nearly cloudless. I noticed the object in the photo after I returned home and was viewing the photos on my computer."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.904486,+-85.713239(15618)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15618) map </A>"}
