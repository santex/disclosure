I was staying the weekend at a friend's home. We were outside looking to the north. There was enough of a moon to beable to see the cloud bank. We noticed that there was a frosty green intermitantly blinking light that was moving south under the cloud bank. The only way to determine it's movent was compareing it's location from one blink to the other. The blinks had absolutely no patteren to them, they were completely random. Once the object came to the edge of the cloud bank it then moved up and then proceeded to go back north over the cloud bank untill it was out of view. At no time did we hear any engie noise. The object had only the one light, no normal FAA lighting, and agian the one light strobed with no set intervals."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","City":"Middle Grove","Date Submitted":"01/31/1993 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.395271","Disposition":"Hoax","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Middle Grove","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Missouri","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04292009-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16723.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16723.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/31/1993 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.395271,+-92.269852(16723)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16723) map </A>","Case Number":"16723","Summary":"All that was visable was the one frosty green blinking light"}
