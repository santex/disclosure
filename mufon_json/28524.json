It was about 10 miles east of Petrified Forest, AZ. I slowed down and took a good look at it. It was oval and had a light on top and on bottom of the craft. It also had a row of lights horizontally in the middle of the craft. The lights were strobing very fast. I slowed down but then got scared and I stepped on the gas. There was a very bright light shining away from me to the north. And I could see the top of the plains which was pretty far from the Interstate. As I sped off I passed a Trucker heading westward and I flashed him to warn him. I went over a hill and I saw his brake lights come on for a couple seconds. I wish I would've stopped and went back. I never reported it. It was by a exit called Pinta Road, which is in a desolate area. I only lived about 30 minutes from that area at the time but I never went back that morning."],"City":"Holbrook","Weather Factors":"None"}
