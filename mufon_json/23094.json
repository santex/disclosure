It remained stationary until i got to the px which took aprox. 5 min. I then stopped to obserbe the object with a few other people for about two min. when a couple of helicopters took of and as soon as the reached about 500 ft this light which did not dim, went without a doubt in a straight line away from us out of sight in less that a two seconds. We all had an eery feeling and everyone gasped. I have never seen anything like this and I have obserbed numerous aircraft flares ect. The object was physically there and went away in a unsurmountable rate of speed as the helicopter obviously went to observe. This is all I am able to say on this matter.
