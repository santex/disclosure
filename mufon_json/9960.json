{"Longitude":"-106.301622","Summary":"Single fast moving white light becomes triangle formation of three that appear connected because they moved exactly in synch with each other.","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","divs":["sighting detailsafter catching something in the sky with a sony super nightshot infra-red handycam early in the morning of 3\\15\\08, i decided to try again on 3\\16\\08 just after 2:00am because i couldn't sleep. it took a little while but i was able to find the same light again or one very similar which later became a triangle formation of three. throughout all the filming i had my focus locked on infinity but the light fades out beyond max optical (40x) zoom (digital zooming). this time i was not as shaken as before and i remembered to include background objects in the video and thus give more detail than i had done before (i learned this on the web site when reporting the first sighting). i also tried turning off the super nightshot mode and learned a little about that. when you see me do this in the video it was the second time i tested different modes and it returned the same result. you hear me say, ���its kinda hard������ and i was describing turning on the super nightshot mode where you have to jump through menu buttons on a touch screen to enable it and that is hard to do and aim the camera too. plain nightshot mode is a physical hardware type switch and much easier to operate, basically foolproof. in normal video mode (all nightshot modes off) my camera can see the light from my tv remote very well but in normal video mode the��� i���ll say ufo because by definition it is, the ufo is just barely visible and this is also true of nightshot mode. i still think it is glowing in infra-red only because i could not see it even on a dark night unless i looked through the camera. in super nightshot mode it is quite visible although harder to see on the camera���s tiny screen than on a tv or computer screen. it is never visible to my unaided eyesight. super nightshot seems to take a long exposure in infra-red (by long i mean ~1\\10 second or something like that ��� longer than other modes). after watching the object and filming for a while it became three objects in the form of a giant triangle all moving in synch. it���s hard to guess the size. the three lights seemed connected as if lighted corners on a big triangle, bigger than several large jets, silently hovering and basically invisible to all but infra-red and best viewed with sony super nightshot. i have edited the video to keep up\\download times reasonable. once again, as before, pain from my disability caused me to stop filming. it had gotten boring anyway because it just hovered and didn���t do much else and i already had enough video to show that."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/16/2008 02:13 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Los Alamos","There was one other sighting in Los Alamos on or around March 16th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"9960","Date Submitted":"03/16/2008 02:13 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9960.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9960.html"],"Log Number":"US-03172008-0002","Latitude":"35.89608","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","City":"Los Alamos","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.89608,+-106.301622(9960)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9960) map </A>","Region":"New Mexico","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:12:00","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle"}
