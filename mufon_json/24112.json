(my phone is a nokia 5800 xpress music, with a carl zeiss, tessar 2.8\\3.7, 3.2 megapixel \\af camera) i followed their movements and also zoomed in (which is what the clicking sound is on the video). they flew from my left to my right, and as they flew to the right i could tell they was also flying further away, into the distance. as they got further away, the furthest right of the three circles started to dim and then disappear from sight, the middle and left circle followed suit as they got further away. if there is any other information that you think is necessary or relevant, i would be happy to provide you with it."],"Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"51.577076","Date of the Event":"06/18/2010 09:41 UTC","City":"Romford","Summary":"UFO triangle formation flew across sky.","Region":"England","Longitude":"0.178319","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.577076,+0.178319(24112)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24112) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/03/2010 09:16 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Country":"United Kingdom","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Romford","There were no other sightings in Romford on or around June 18th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
