I saw what appeared to be a group of stars, looking towards the nw from my driveway. From where they were positioned they would possibly be over the gulf of mexico. Then all of a sudden two stars that were close to eachother started moving in opposite directions. One went n-nw, while the other went s-sw. The one that had gone sw returned after a few minutes or so then went nw. Before they had moved they were stationary as stars, for about five minutes or so. They were starlike. After seeing report #48481, I had to report this as well. Thank you. PS I stated 4-5 objects as in the group of stars, the two middle ones were the ones that moved off."],"City":"Port Charlotte","Date of the Event":"01/18/2013 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Case Number":"48503","Longitude":"-82.10518","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Port Charlotte","There were no other sightings in Port Charlotte on or around January 18th 2013"],"Summary":"same as case 48481","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48503.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48503.html"]}
