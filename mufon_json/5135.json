(this information may aid our engineers in reverse-engineering their technology, i would think.) the craft were identical in size and shape. at the bottom were 4 bright, rounds areas, which initially struck me as windows during the event. now the critical observations from an engineer's mind (mine) regarding this: the crafts stopped instantaneously, not very quickly, nor really really really quickly. they stopped absolutely at an instant in time. clearly, any living beings in those craft would have had to have enjoyed a separate gravity \"bubble\", so as to be fully protected from the unbelievable acceleration\\deceleration the craft exhibited. the four pods on the underside of the craft had what seemed to be of a color at the moment of observation, yet within seconds after the observation, i couldn't for the life of me remember the color!! i realized a few days later that the pods had to have been the actuators of the anti-gravity drive, and that they were lighted due to ionization of the air at a certain boundary layer. the inability to discern color was due to the fact that that boundary layer is an altered state of our space\\time reality. the craft made no sound whatsoever. none. the directions and speed of the craft were absolute. i mean that the craft were traveling in absolute directions and at an absolute speed. all i can say is that if you ever witness this, you will know what i mean. i stayed outside for a good 10 minutes afterwards, just to make sure my powers of observation were not altered in some way. after hearing dogs barking in the distance, and seeing commercial aircraft flying high overhead, and seeing cars driving down the roads, i parked the car properly and went into my home. the question that kept coming into my head was, \"who are we?\", not who were they, or anything like that, but just who the hell are we. i had the sense that they knew that i was observing them, but that it gave them no concern whatsoever, and that i was of no interest to them. i think that they were checking up on particular individuals of interest, much like a rancher might fly his helicopter over his cattle to look for particularly marked animals."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-99.897883","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.976679,+-99.897883(5135)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5135) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"5135","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Features":"Other","Date Submitted":"03/15/2002 07:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Date of the Event":"03/15/2002 07:00 UTC","Summary":"Three Craft in Tight Formation Zig-Zagging over Katy, TX.","Log Number":"US-07232006-0004","Source":"MUFON"}
