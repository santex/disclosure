Around 12:15 am, me and two friends sitting by me caught a lime green object flying through the sky. The object was heading east in a flat path. It never turned or changed directions. We watched it go till we could not see it over the tree line. This object was moving faster then any aircraft I have seen. There was something weird about the way it was flying to, the only word we could use to describe it was \"smooth.\""],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in O'Fallon","There were no other sightings in O'Fallon on or around May 7th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Missouri","Date Submitted":"05/08/2011 11:41 UTC","Case Number":"29013","Object Shape":"Other"}
