{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsIT WAS A CRYSTAL CLEAR NIGHT, I WENT OUT SID WITH MY BINOCULARS AS I USAUALLY DO ON A CLEAR NIGHT TO LOOK AT THE MOON. AS I GLANCED UP I NOTICED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A STAR AT 10 PM TO THE MOON THE NEXT DAY I WENT OUT THE SAME STAR WAS NOW AT 5 PM POSITION. THE 3RD DAY I WENT OUT IT WAS AT 7PM POSITION WITH A CLEAR RING AROUND THE MOON. I WENT OUT TO NIGHT ALL THOUGH THERE IS SOME CLOUD COVER THE BRIGHT STAR IS GONE. I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT IS MY FIRST SIGHTING. THIS STAR SLOWLY ROTATED AROUND THE MOON FOR AT LEAST 3 DAYS AND THEN VANISHED I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANY BODY ELSE NOTICED THIS. i TRULEY BELIEVE THIS IS AN ALIEN AIRCRAFT OBSERVIG EARTH. STARS DO NOT ROTATE AROUND THE MOON.
