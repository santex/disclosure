On the way, I spotted a white object flying from West to East. I thought it was an airplane at first, but it was a white sphere. I quickly took my camera and tried to film it. During the first attempt. I didn't zoom in so the object looked very small in the video. During the second clip, I zoomed in to the max, but I didn't do a very good job getting it in the field of vision. But, I did manage to get a glimpse of it. There was a separate incident in San Antonio, TX. I was staying at Hilton on Westover Hills Blvd. Same date, August 16th, at around 945 pm, I saw a pulsating flying object flying across the sky from South to North. I was roasting mash mallows and watching \"Curious George\" on the big wall in the courtyard at the hotel. I didn't have my camera then. I observed the sky throughout the night, there was no other aircraft flying through that area (I guess it is not a flying zone). I tried to film the next night, but I didn't see anything in the sky."],"Date of the Event":"08/16/2009 12:53 UTC","Latitude":"29.706623","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Columbus","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18753.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18753.html"]}
