I lived in a second story apt. One night I woke up and it was so cold. The power was out. I got my baby from his room and wrapped him in his blanket. I could not go back to sleep. I stood at my window and looked out at the canyons of the Rocky mts. All of a sudden I noticed a ufo hoving and moving slowly towards the canyons. It was right above the apt complex, But moving away into the mts.It was box shape. It looked dark. It had alot of lights under it. I watched it go into the canyons. Then it was gone."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Colorado"}
