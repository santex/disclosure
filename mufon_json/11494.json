One morning in march of 1993 i believe, i was playing in the backyard when i noticed an object in the sky off in the distance. I was mesmerised by it and as i watched it noticed it was heading my way. It was completely silent and it was my first real experince with UFO's. It glided infront of me approx. 150ft in the air and i could see what looked like windows on this strange object. I watched it with amazment as it flew off into the distance until i couldnt see it anymore."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"138.523625","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Morphett Vale","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"Australia","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"11494","Date Submitted":"02/28/1993 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11494.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11494.html"],"Log Number":"AU-07092008-0004"}
