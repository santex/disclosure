I then noticed what looked like a reflective object in the sky slowly following the flight path of the larger meteor. I ran in the house leaving the car door open and went to get my camera and wake my wife and son. They came out and saw the meteors, but the did not see the UFO. Luckily I had taken the picture before they got outside. I have a picture of the object and video of the meteors. I thought it was funny that I didn't hear anything about meteors on that day, because I am sure they were meteors. And at least three of them."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.692998,+-117.364984(46881)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46881) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","Case Number":"46881","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/27/2012 07:25 UTC","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lake Elsinore","There were no other sightings in Lake Elsinore on or around October 27th 2012"]}
