{"Log Number":"US-02272008-0009","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home heading east in Corona noticed what looked like a jet trail situated vertically in the western sky over the hills. At first I thought it was just a cloud, (strange though that it was vertical) but when I got out of my car at home I noticed it was moving and the trail was vertical to what must have been quite a large falling object. As we watched the object fall it moved in a more southerly or horizontal direction. We could see thru binoculars that it appeared to be a very large object that might perhaps go on to land in the ocean. We finally lost sight of it when it went behind the hills near our house. There were a couple of airplanes in the area, they must have seen this too. But there has been nothing on the news, and besides my husband, son, and our neighbor I haven't talked to anyone else who saw this."],"Case Number":"9735","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9735.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9735.html"],"Summary":"Object falling out of the sky","Date of the Event":"02/26/2008 06:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/26/2008 06:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-117.561388","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.884194,+-117.561388(9735)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9735) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Corona","There were no other sightings in Corona on or around February 26th 2008"],"Latitude":"33.884194","City":"Corona"}
