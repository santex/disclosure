But we coudnt hear them, their had to be 50+; and we only have a small commercial airport. Then I saw what I though was a planet, rapidly loose size, until a smaller object (purplish) shot out. Another one circled over me and my father, for about two minutes. I felt bizarre, and nervous. Both me and my father left are phones at home. It was hard to look at the object, like a black Circe was covering it."],"Case Number":"50404"}
