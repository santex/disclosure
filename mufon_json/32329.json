We were camping in our RV. After we got back from the festival around 5pm, my wife was inside the RV making dinner and I went out for a smoke. I was watching the sky to the North above the mountain range and I seen a flying UFO. I immediately called my wife and we witnessed it for about another two minutes then it disappeared. It was interesting but hard to draw any conclusions since it was small and over a mile away I would say. It looked like a gun metal grey and a saucer shape with a dome. This would be my third UFO sighting within 2 years and my wife's first."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10042011-0004","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32329.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32329.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/04/2011 01:10 UTC","Case Number":"32329","Region":"Washington","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"47.233934","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Other"}
