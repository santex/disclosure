While sitting in my living room, I was looking out my back sliding glass door and saw a BlueGreen object descending at a steep angle of 15-30 degrees. It entered at aprox. 2 O'clock position from a West to Easterly trajectory. It was a large meteor and very brilliantly lit atypical blue green which then turned orange as it elongated and sparked as pieces broke forward of the main body. It then burnt out. I am reporting this to clarify any questionable sittings for this date. I don't know if this should be reported to any other agency?"],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Star-like, Teardrop","Weather Factors":"None"}
