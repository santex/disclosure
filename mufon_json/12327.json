The visible sun had dropped near the horizon and was obscured by cirrus clouds. Purple cirrus clouds were illuminated in the Western sky. I looked Northwest over a farm field and saw a stack of lights, six or seven stacked up vertically. It was more like 2 at the bottom horizontally aligned, then three above that row, horizontally aligned, then three more on the next horizontal plane. It looked like a chandelier. I only saw it for a few seconds. I went through some trees, which blocked the view. As I emerged from the trees to the next open area, the lights were gone. At the time, I perceived that these were several crafts in formation. But as I think back, it could have been one large craft with an array of light sources. There was no visible movement. But I only saw it for about 3 seconds."],"Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Ohio","Longitude":"-81.83569","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12327.html"],"Summary":"Stack of lights over west of Marks Rd.
