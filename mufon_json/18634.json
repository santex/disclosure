{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsWell I was driving home when I seen what seemed to be a stationary craft, that's what immediately caught my eye. Then when I looked close the light scheme was not anything I had ever seen before on a plane at night, it was red, yellow and what looked to be white one right after another. I called my friend a mile away he stepped out and spotted the object as well, but in a matter of 15-20secs it was out of sight. Then about 10mins later the same friend as well as another went back out to take a second look, this time they spotted two of these crafts with the same lighting. I have seen similar reports, this is very interesting."],"Region":"Michigan","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Battle Creek","There were no other sightings in Battle Creek on or around August 12th 2009"],"Latitude":"42.328372","Case Number":"18634","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Red, Yellow, White lights flashing on craft in the nights sky","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18634.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18634.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.328372,+-85.172574(18634)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18634) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/12/2009 11:50 UTC","City":"Battle Creek","Longitude":"-85.172574","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08132009-0003","Date Submitted":"08/12/2009 11:50 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc"}
