Watched for about 5 hours. It was a triangle that was catching light from moon. Triangle had another triangle inside of it. Not sure if this is manmade or not. It hovered for hours only moving slightly. There was not wind and it was a very clear night. Could be seen very clearly through a high quality scope. At daybreak it became very bright and almost looked like a planet or star with the naked eye but much brighter. This was seen by three people. If anyone else saw or heard anything in the area please contact me. Thanks."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06082009-0011","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Ruston","There were no other sightings in Ruston on or around June 6th 0001"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"17385"}
