I was aiming for my shot of the landscape, when I saw the object come into view. I watched it cross the sky until it went out-of-sight behind the hills on the left. We had seen a helicopter just a few moments before this, headed in the opposite direction, but at a greater altitude. In the attached picture, you'll see the object just left of center, above the hill. A second picture attached is my attempt at creating a close-up view from the original picture. Thanks, Mike"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Ireland"}
