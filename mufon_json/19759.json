(in retrospect, it sounded a lot like a computer connecting to the interned through a modem) it hung directly above my eyes for about ten seconds making these weird sounds. then the sounds stopped. i still could not move a muscle. it hovered motionless above my face for several second then rapidly accelerated toward the open window. as it began to move my muscles came back to life, but i had no chance to catch it because it was out the window within a second. once out the window it veered up and eastward. by the time i raced to the window it was gone. oddly, when i relayed this event to my next door neighbor a couple of days later, he and his wife had a \"ball of light\" story of their own. they claimed a ball of floating light, some years earlier, had startled them while cleaning up after dinner. it floated through the glass of their closed kitchen window. they said it was about 9 inches in diameter. they were scared and stayed well away from it. it floated very slowly about shoulder high through their kitchen, turned 90 degrees, then moved through their living room and out through a glass storm door. they said it floated slowly across the street and hit a dog that was sitting on the porch of a home across the street. they said it killed the dog."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around June 2nd 1968"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Hoax"}
