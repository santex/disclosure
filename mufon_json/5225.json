My kids were upstairs in their rooms and my husband was in his lazy boy next to me watching ESPN. My dog came into the living room straight to me and stared, wagging her tail. I set my laptop on the sofa cushion next to me and grabbed her leash by the door, taking her outside to go to the bathroom. As I shut the door behind me and got about half way to her tie out the full moon in the east grabbed my attention right away. It was beautiful! I hooked her up, came inside, grabbed my camera and tripod, completely forgetting my laptop was on, went back out and set up in the drive way. I have a digital Konica Minolta Dimage Z6, 6.0 megapixels with a 12 x anti shake optical zoom. I live in the country so I have a pretty good view of the stars with no interference from city lights. I stood out there and managed to get 44 still shots of the moon and clouds altogether. At 10:19pm, as I was in the midst of taking the moon shots a light blast of cold air hit me from above. It wasn���t a normal breeze, this was a light blast of cold that hit the very top of my head traveling down to my feet. Yes there was a slight breeze last night as I stood there and took the pictures of the moon, but this was different. It was cold and only lasted for a second. Right away I looked straight up above me into the night sky. The only thing I could see were stars. There was nothing above me. I then noticed a small engine plane off in the distance coming from the east, heading towards my direction on the left side of the moon with a spotlight shinning at first to the north, then down onto the woods below it. I quickly reached down and grabbed my camera, tripod and all, and took a picture directly overhead of me where I felt the blast of cold air, where there were nothing but stars. Then I looked to the east again and watched as the small plane made it���s way closer to me heading west, still spotlighting certain areas, including the sky. I took a couple of pictures of the plane, and watched it go out of view before going back to taking pictures of the full moon. Later, when I came inside and downloaded my pictures I was stunned to see this image on the photo I had taken above my head where the cold air came from. Where there was absolutely nothing in the sky but stars. As far as my dogs behavior, she was barking and pacing and breathing very fast a couple of different times during the entire time I was out. I remember this because it was so quiet out last night that when she did bark it startled me and I jerked the tripod, messing up on a couple of different shots of the moon.
