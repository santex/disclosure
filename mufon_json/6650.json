I slowed down because I noticed the flashing object was getting closer. Within seconds the now bright object was hovering about 200 feet from me which I at that moment stoped to look at my reflection of my truck from the sphere. It might have been a minute before it left in the opposite direction at the same angle it came from. Within seconds it was in space. It was a clear night without clouds. The sphere made no sound as it was hovering and when it left. I was not so much shocked but stunned and kept it prety much to myself. At the time I was attending a private christian unversity and working 2nd shift at a bakery."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Other"}
