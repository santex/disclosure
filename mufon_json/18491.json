I heard a low hum getting louder as it approached. From the south 5 very bright light moved at high speed heading north. the lights were in the pattern of a \"house\" shape. we all seen it, but to this day, they deny it. it didnt look like a plane or jet flying low. these lights i seen all the way in the northern horizon. i didnt know what it was at first. whatever the object was, it moved straight without stopping. i felt dazed, but not too dazed. i looked down at the others only to notice that they didnt move, like they had froze staring at it. i ran up the hill. the object didnt stop."]}
