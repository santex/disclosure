It was pulsating colors of red green blue and some orange. the colors are what made me notice it and I had heard of people seeing this in the sky not to long ago. it stayed stationary and just pulsated the different colors constantly. It didn't have a particular patter that I could tell. I was so fascinated by it i put my dog inside and walked down my street to the corner to see if i could get a better look."],"Date Submitted":"08/22/2012 07:06 UTC","Summary":"I saw what looked like a star twinkling colors","City":"Blue Springs","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-94.270722","Case Number":"41929","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Blue Springs","There were no other sightings in Blue Springs on or around August 22nd 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.995735,+-94.270722(41929)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41929) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41929.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41929.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"08/22/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City"}
