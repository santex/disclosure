{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were fishing in Monroe, Ohio and saw what looked like a \"shooting star\". I told my wife too look up and we both saw it split into 4 separate pieces ... after splitting into 4 separate \"fire balls\" they looked as if they were headed downward. After a few seconds of falling they disappeared and four white circles of light appeared. These lights were circular and there were never more than four of them, but one would disappear and another would appear in a different spot instantaneously (in the same area). My wife tried to take a picture of the white lights and all we saw was a black picture but after looking at picture the next day she actually picked up a few of the lights. After a few minutes we lost sight of the four lights in the tree line. For a few minutes we would catch a glimpse of light thru the trees."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Region":"Ohio","Date Submitted":"07/14/2013 10:34 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/12/2013 10:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.43454,+-84.362567(48951)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48951) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48951.html"],"Country":"United States","City":"Monroe","Summary":"\"shooting star\" turns into four white \"orbs\"","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"39.43454","Log Number":"US-07142013-0026","Longitude":"-84.362567","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around July 12th 2013"],"Case Number":"48951","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
