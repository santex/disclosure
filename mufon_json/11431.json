to pick up an item for my son in the morning that he requested.it was a hot summer night, clear skies in the end of week of july 2006. there were several men working on the street with construction near the mobil gas station not far from the intersection of olden\\pennington ave. there were cars out, but it was not very busy. i attempted to turn on my radio of car once i left the store,but it was not working correctly.i even thought, umm. something is wrong with the radio is it so static..so, i turned it off. approx.1:25 am after leaving the store, i made right turn onto olden avenue in direction to the high school, pass mcdonald's and pass offices on my left hand side of car. at that point pass the little white stone bridge of the near the church property, across the street, i viewed a reddish\\green light circle approx.3 ft circle, in the trees on my driver's side which never in past seen before. olden avenue is a normal route to get to my home approx. 3 blocks away from that specific location where i saw this object. i drive this road daily, it was the first time i had ever seen something like this. i have lived in the town for over 20 years. i thought it was strange seeing this light circle object, and i passed it slowly on my left side driver side.it was about 100ft away. it was inside the trees. i expressed,\"what is that? where is that comming from?\" i didn't see anything projecting from it. there were a few cars infront of me in a distance on olden ave the same direction i was going, but they were ahead of me,by the time i saw this, no cars where infront of me.it was quiet on olden avenue. it was in the trees above near the side of the house i continued to go slowly passing it on my right side of car, alittle further at the next street which was less than several feet away, i saw a very large boomerang object, size 1\\2 football field in length hovering over treeline of homes open space area from my driver's side window. i was on olden avenue and this huge object was adjacent to my view on the left side while i was in my car from the street. it was approx 300 ft away from me seeing from the distance.it hovered over several homes, and i couldn't see the other side of the object. it was silent, bobbing alittle, not in moving position.i didnot hear any noise from it. i said, oh.my god, what is that? that is huge ufo!! that is not a plane, helicopter,or anything i had seen before.no miltary craft would be out doing this above these houses.( airforce base is about 35 min. by car in south direction of town.we have an airport in town too, but not anything flying object seen shape like this before.it was no stealth flyer. this thing looked like a mothership of a huge object. we are about 10 minutes from delaware river) that thing is too close to the ground. i got to get out of here, now!!\" i did not see any people walking on that specific street that night. the v shape bommerang was a solid object, silvish color,with long end pointing to direction to north. the sideof the object had with several lights which hovered above treeline of the homes.(glendale sect.)it was very noticable, and i wondered if other neighbors saw it. i was overwhelmed,scared and shaking.i never seen anything like this before. i could only view one side of it, that how large it looked from its expansion, i saw a blub white object on the bottom of it. i have never seen a shape of a strange flying that low proximity at all near ground level.i even tried to say to myself it was a military object, but logically i said they would not be doing this kind of miltary exercise over people's homes.there is no reason for them to do this.this is wild!! it was so close to ground level over these peoples houses. i was totally overwhelmed what i viewed.i continued to drive slowly.less than 10 miles a hour.i checked if cars behind me and none around.i took the next rt turn onto glen mawr to get to my house several blocks away from this location. i had no time elapse and i was not abducted. i was saying the lord's prayer driving home to myself. it was about 4 minutes later from what i just viewed to my house. i remember still shaking in my car when i turned into my driveway. i had to calm down before entering my house, because my teen children were watching a movie at the time.i entered the house, and my oldest child saw my expression on my face. my daughter knew something was wrong. i sat with them and explained what i viewed and tried not to frighten them. i said maybe it had to do with the military. at that time, the skies were active with planes around here. my daughter admitted hearing a story years ago at the fields near trenton state, someone expressed a craft was seen. i had no idea that this stuff was happening around here. i told them that i was not going back to see it again lets forget about it until we speak to their dad..my husband was on a trip, expect him the next day. i said no one is going to believe me if i call the police.i didn't want to call him because it was late.my son and i went to computer to see if this object had been seen before. i saw a drawing that looked so similar like the one in hudson valley sightings in the l980's.i didnot sleep well that night..my adreline was up and deep down inside i was concern what i had seen a few hrs before. next day, my car in driveway didnot work in morning for several hours, unusual behavioral pattern of wild yellow bird and a large turtle shown up my frontlawn consectively 2 days in a row in the same location on my our property after this ufo incident the following day. the car started up before my husband returned home.when my husband came home and i told him what happened, he laughed and told me not to worry about it.i even thought i may have a wire loose with system in the car, but then i canceled so see the mechanic since the car started to work okay.if it happen again, i will bring it to the shop. then the unusual things started to occur outside of my house on my front property..first, i saw this yellow bird little larger than a canary when i was in a car with my husband when we were talking privately in the car in our driveway. the bird flew onto the review mirror of passenger side.it was like it was trained and not frighten of humans. it stayed on the car for a while atleast 10 minutes.it went on the mirror to the car hood near the front glass of the car..my husband and i both commented what a beautiful bird and how friendly this wild bird behavior coming onto the car when we were sitting inside of it. we thought it was sweet alittle unusual, but neither of us didn't think anything about it. we then went inside and didnot see the bird again. that afternoon, i found a 2ft size turtle on my front lawn before plans were made to mow the grass. i don't live near a forest at all and this was the first time this ever happen to see one around on my lawn. i called my son out of home and let him view it.it reminded me of my late father when i was a child would bring turtles to my home..i would take care of them and then let them go in the wild. i said that is strange, seen 2 living creatures never been around before on my property on the same day..never seen any yellow bird before at all, but i know they are around in nj. when time to mow my lawn, turtle was gone, and didn't see the bird except when i was in the car speaking to my husband...i even went out checking the bushes, didn't see the turtle at all. i was afraid that my dog would get it since he had a tendency to run out of my house at times..second day, was very strange. next day,i was in my car in my driveway in the morning about 9am, reading the paper that i just went to get before entering the house. the same yellow bird showed up again and began erratically attacking my car side window when i was in it for 15 minutes.i timed it. i said, what is wrong with this crazy, wacky bird? i am not getting out of the car until it calms down.it really acting weird. never seen a wild bird doing this kind of reaction of behavior out of the blue. i ask my neighbors yesterday if they were missing a pet bird and they said they didn't have one. i am reading the paper and it is pecking at my window of the side of car.i felt like it wanted me out of the car. i finally decided to get out of car with my roll newpaper saying to myself if it comes near me, i will swat it like a baseball flying in the air..hahahaha..i had to laugh it was so crazy.i opened my side of drivers door and it flew off..well, i walk onto front area to steps..the turtle that i seen the day before at another part of front lawn is now at the steps going to my front door.i said, where did this turtle come from, i checked the bushes yesterday and it was not around. i called my son and husband out of the house to see the turtle.my son even said, isn't that the turtle we saw yesterday? how did it get here? i said, mr. turtle is definitely not comming inside this house. i said something weird is going on..too concidential that we see these things 2 days in a row first time out of all these years on my front lawn. i was wondering if it had a connection to the ufo situation.i said i see a ufo, car not working then started up again, and then reptile and bird show up that never seen at all before on our property, let alone on our frontyard? i said something is not right. i said\"i don't know where you came from since you were gone yesterday and you show up at my doorsteps?\" my husband was quiet about it and said, lets just leave it alone. it will go away again.\" i didn't touch it at all.when we came back from store, it was gone. nothing out of the norm happened again until next early morning hrs. i was up doing my work while family was asleep.i went to bedroom about 3 am.i said my nightly routine prayers. i was sitting on my bed and turned to the window. didn't notice anything happening at all when i entered the room. the hall light was on, but not my light in my bedroom. about 5 minutes later, i saw a very bright white light from my bedroom window with the shade partially open that faces the outside of my street. this bright light was projecting to the ground on my street going upwards the top end of the street. didnot go near window to see what created that light from the sky. but it was very bright.i was saying please god don't let it shine on this house. i didn't turn the lights on in my house, because i was frighten it would create attention to whatever was creating it..it was so noticable, it lit up the street up. my street was completely quiet. i covered myself with my sheets with my head direction to window, and i counted it for 9 seconds. when it disappeared,i said.\" what was that??i said that is no lighting, and the lamp post didn't create that light.\" i was fully awake. at that point, i was shook up. i know what i just saw and that was not a normal occurrance. i didn't wake up my family because i felt they would have been scared.i finally feel alseep about 6 am when daily light. i woke up in the morning, i decided to go outside. i saw a marking on the street that left a residue white chalky substance at the place i saw the light first protruding to the ground on my street.i refuse to touch it.i have photos of it. that specific mark has not disappeared under any weather condition since this bright light occurred in july 2006. i never touched the marking left on the street at all. i thought it was important to write this today since someone else also admitted viewing an ufo in glendale sect. on your website.this is not far from where i live in the same town in ewing twp, nj. there have been increase sightings around this area. i have not seen any ufo's after this occurance in 2006.i don't go out looking for them at all.it was my first time ever seeing itin 2006.i have not seen one since it happened. i never believed in these things were real until i experienced it myself. i don't have hallucinations or use drugs\\alcohol at all.i worked in professional field until i retired 10 year ago. i know exactly what i saw that night, including the other strange occurances that happened a few days in a row afterwords.my family witnessed the yellow bird and turtle seen too. i have spoken to a few individuals in my town who have admitted to seeing other objects in this town and surrounding area after i have discussed my own personal experience.i would take a polygraph and pass too!! something is going on around this area.."],"Latitude":"40.279196"}
