I noticed a glowing green ball on the ground. I zoomed in on it and it looked like 2 eyes, just green glowing eyes on the ground. I got a little scared so I went inside to look at the photos and you can see a green orb right around the area of the landing. it did not look like a cat or any other animal. I went back out and took more photos about 10 minutes later and it was gone!"],"Longitude":"-84.563103"}
