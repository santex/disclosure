{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was about 10 o'clock PM.I was driving down the road in Franklin Ohio and my friend said \"wow what is that.\" we look to the sky and notice three fire balls in the sky traveling in a triangular formation. My first thought was shooting stars. The looked like metiorites. But as soon as i said that the lights would go off and come back on. The objects would also twist and twirl and move in every direction. at times a disc shape could be made out. we got out of the car at a gas station down the road and at a fairly quick rate the three objects decended below trees as if they made it to the ground. there was a hot air balloon show in that direction but i found our because of the wind no balloons were in the air. Besides there is no way it was a balloon."],"Latitude":"39.524658","Case Number":"18150","Summary":"Three fireball like discs in a triangular arrangment made their way to the ground in six minutes or so.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.524658,+-84.391946(18150)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18150) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07182009-0006","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/17/2009 10:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Middletown","There were no other sightings in Middletown on or around July 17th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-84.391946","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc, Fireball","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Ohio","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18150.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18150.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/17/2009 10:00 UTC","City":"Middletown"}
