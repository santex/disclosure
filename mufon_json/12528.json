Then after 40 something seconds it just dissapered.Keeping me wondering being there was a Army base in ceiba which we were close by to.....Was it goverment testing or was it the real deal?By the way,the Army base was moved out of the area way before I spotted this.I regret not having a camera phone at that given moment."],"Tags":"City"}
