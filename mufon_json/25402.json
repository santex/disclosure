After an exclamation from one of my friends, I turned my head (I was already looking up at the stars) and caught sight of a small dim light traveling very fast in the sky. At first thought, I considered it to be a bird soring around. It continued until it was hidden behind high Cirrus clouds. Coming from behind the clouds, it continued to go in a straight line. At this point I was highly confused. If it was a plane, it was traveling faster than any plane I've seen at that hight. At that speed, it would have made some sort of sound being at such a low level (but it was higher than that). Finally, I lost sight of it, both from getting too far away and blending into the light pollution over Raleigh."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"25402","Latitude":"35.775416","Longitude":"-78.636094","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
