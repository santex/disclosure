{"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI OBSERVED A LIGHT IN THE NIGHT SKY MOVING AT AN AIRCRAFT SPEED. IT WAS MOVINGFROM WEST TO EAST FROM THE TIME I SAW IT,ABOUT 30 MILES. I DIDNT THINK MUCHABOUT IT UNTIL IT STOPPED IN MID AIR OVER AN AREA WHERE SALT RIVER POWER PLANTIS LOCATED. THAT GOT MY ATTENTION AND THAT IS WHEN I CALL MY WIFE OUTSIDE. ITHOVERED FOR ABOUT 10 TO 15 SECONDS AND DURING THAT TIME SEVERAL SMALLER OBJECTSWHITE IN COLOR ENTERED TO MAIN OBJECT. THE OBJECT CHANGED DIRECTIONS AND MADE ASTRAIGHT 90 DEGREE CHANGE OF DIRECTION. IT FLEW STRAIGHT NORTH. WE WERE ABLE TOOBSERVE IT FOR ABOUT 5-10 SECONDS, UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT. I ESTIMATE THAT WEWERE ABLE TO WATCH IT FOR 60 TO 80 MILES IN THAT SHORT SPAN OF TIME.OF COURSE I WASNT CONVINCED COMPLETLY THAT IS WHAT I SAW. A RETIRED AIR FORCEPLIOT WAS TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL THAT I WAS AT, AND I TOLD HIM THE STORY. HELAUGHED A LITTLE BUT SAID THAT HE WOULD CHECK WITH RADAR AT LUKE AIR BASE TO SEEIF THEY HAD ANY SIGHTINGS ON THAT DATE. COUPLE DAYS LATER COL. PERRY INDICATEDTO ME THAT THERE HAD BEEN SIGHTING ON RADAR THAT PARTICULAR EVENING."],"Longitude":"-112.064477","Summary":"DUMB FOUNDED","Region":"Arizona","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"2115","City":"Phoenix","Latitude":"33.455027","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/03/1963 10:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2115.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2115.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Log Number":"","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around June 3rd 1963"],"Weather Factors":"None, Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/03/1963 10:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.455027,+-112.064477(2115)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2115) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
