{"Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis event was a sound only. I was in a parking lot next to a restaurant near anairport. A loud sound that had several pitches swirled around the area. Itsounded like what you would expect in a UFO movie. The noise went in a circulardirection and seemed to reflect off nearby buildings. My first thought was I wasimagining what I heard, but I turned to see the expression on my sons face and afamily several yards away standing in amazement so I knew it was real. When myson and I walked past the family, they asked us if we saw anything---no, andneither had they. Neither my son, nor I know what to think, but it definatelywas something most people never hear. Thats it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Sounds","Date of the Event":"01/20/0001 06:50 UTC","Case Number":"2087","Longitude":"-87.207905","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.423899","City":"Pensacola","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.423899,+-87.207905(2087)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2087) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"01/20/0001 06:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2087.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2087.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Pensacola","There were no other sightings in Pensacola on or around January 18th 0001"]}
