All lights were off and I was lookingout my windows. When I saw the object fly over my house kinda wobbling and thesame time. It was in the shape of a triangle, and three small lights and eachcorner and a red one in the center. And the body was black. I just knew at oncethat this was an alien ship, I had no doubt about it. I havent an idea why buti knew it was alien. So I staed laying on my bed and just watched it fly way tothe horizon. It didnt dash away or spike staight up. It just disappeared intothe horizon. Now it wasnt dark out, it was just after sunset and the sky was adark blue. Once I lost sight of it, I just fell asleep. And that was the firsttime in weeks that I hadnt slept so soundly.
