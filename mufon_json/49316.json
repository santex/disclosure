From there, off to the west, I observed a bright, stationary object approx. 10-20 degrees off the horizon. Observing through binoculars did not help me to determine a shape, but I was able to determine a red glow around the bottom of it. As this object was hovering in the air, 4 other crafts ascended from the ground into sky one after the other over a span of 15 mins. These crafts were glowing orange and rose to an unknown height where the orange glow then ceased from shining. After this occurred, original bright object slowly disappeared.
