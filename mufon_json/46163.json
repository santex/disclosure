I glanced up and saw six or seven bright blue-white lights in formation moving smoothly and silently across the sky. They were 'flying-wing' shaped without any aircraft type lights. The entire surface of each object was glowing. I thought they were possibly illuminated birds at first, but they were moving too quickly. They accelerated rapidly beyond my line of site due to tall trees in the near ground. I was in disbelief and feel a bit shaken. I have never researched or reported a UFO sighting. Any other \"UFO\" I have previously witnessed was unremarkable compared to this."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Boomerang","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46163.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46163.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Smooth, silent acceleration of bright glowing lights across sky","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Holly Springs","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"03/12/2013 10:25 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03122013-0022","Date Submitted":"03/12/2013 11:51 UTC","Longitude":"-78.833622","Region":"North Carolina"}
