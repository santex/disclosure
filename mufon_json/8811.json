It was Mid January of approx 1992. He and a couple of friends and I, decided to take his party boat out for a midnight fishing trip. Weather was cool and cristal clear. The stars were sparkling as is common in Arizona desert. I thought it was very nice and refreshing being from Alaska. We fished for a while trying different locations on the lake. When I looked up for some reason, probably just to marvel at the stars, A very bright star got my attention. Since I was not familiar with the lake I ask my brother if the bright star might be venus or some other star in that position in the sky. He assured me it could not be. We continued watching it for 10 minutes or so and marveled at its luminosity, as it stood motionless in the sky. I jokenly said it was probably just a UFO, and we all laughed. All of us were still discussing its possibility when it took off as if shot from a cannon and dissapeared in about 3-5 seconds in a quartering and away direction from us. I have no idea how large the thing was or how far from us it was. I hold a commercial pilot license and have seen a lot of plane but this one I can't explain. There was not much else to do so we continued fishing for a while longer and then called it a night."],"Date Submitted":"01/10/1992 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Lake havasu","There were no other sightings in Lake havasu on or around January 10th 1992"],"Longitude":"-114.174453","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.349022,+-114.174453(8811)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8811) map </A>","Tags":"City","City":"Lake havasu","Latitude":"34.349022","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8811.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8811.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-01102008-0001","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Very bright star","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00"}
