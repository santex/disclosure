{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs reported by phone to ASD: Witness Age 33 Aug 8 and 9 at 10:18 pm. both nights - Clinton, MO: The witness saw a bright glowing white light��� ESE of his position halfway over the first bridge over Lake of the Ozarks south of Clinton on Highway 13. He slammed on the breaks because he thought something was exploding. This is at the Montrose Exit, and he was headed North on Highway 13. The object was on the East side of the bridge. A second smaller light appeared below it then slowly moved into the one above it. It looked like the second light was gathering light below it. It then just disappeared and was no longer visible. He said that the object color looked like a white florescent bulb. It was at the same height just above tree level on both nights. There were a few trees in the way when he first saw it, and as he drove by it popped out into clear view. There was a big storm with lots of lighting that looked like a Tesla coil with static electricity pouring from the clouds, and he thought that the light was related to the lighting. It would take a nickel at arm���s length to cover the object. Aug 9 at 10:18 pm the same thing appeared, but it was ENE from his location further south on the highway, on the second bridge south of Clinton on Highway 13. Was over the water this night. This time the same thing happened with the smaller light forming then going into the larger ball of light. There were clear skies on that night with no clouds or lighting. He said he got the strange feeling like ���The boogey man is real,��� and that the experience has changed his view of reality. Note: His parents are truck drivers. His mother told one of her friends about it and he sais that he saw a white light coming towards him while he was driving in the area in the past few days, The light stopped, made a right angle turn, then it went up in the sky and disappeared. He lives in Boliver, MO Ricky told some of his co-workers about his sightings and most of them laughed at him, but one man said that while he did not believe in UFOs, he did see something strange recently. He and his buddy were fishing one night on the lake (no date given) and they saw a big ball of white light and 6 smaller lights came out of it, they shot away very quickly, then returned to join with the larger light. A lot of people he works with in Clinton say they are seeing strange things more often. He and his son often watch the stars at night. Some time ago they saw an orange light appear at 60 degrees off the horizon, in the same direction as the lake. He was living in Oceola at the time and it was North of there. They also watched lots of ���stars��� moving across the sky, but thought that was odd, too. He grew up in Anton Kentucky, outside Madisonville, around coal mines. There were lots of truck drivers in the area and he played with the CB radio often. When he was a kid he and his mother saw white lights go down in the trees one night and got several drivers and security guards to watch the lights, too. One night they saw bright orange bars in the sky just above the trees. The bars were sized small to large and shaped in a perfect circle. His mother made him go inside the house so he did not see it leave the area. I have attached a Google map of the area with the approximate location of the objects."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30836.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30836_submitter_file1__sightinglocationsClinton.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30836.html"],"Weather Factors":"Lightning, Light","Case Number":"30836","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-93.770299","Date of the Event":"08/08/2011 10:18 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Clinton","There were no other sightings in Clinton on or around August 8th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"08/12/2011 01:27 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"38.373392","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Glowing ball of white light hoovering over Lake of the Ozarks on two nights","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.373392,+-93.770299(30836)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30836) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08122011-0010","Object Features":"None","Region":"Missouri","City":"Clinton"}
