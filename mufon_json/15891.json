At first we thought it was something in our apartment or the neighbor fighting, but when we went outside to see a lot of people were asking, \"Did you just here that?\" I asked a lady walking her dog and she said she heard it from right above us and asked if i had known of any buildings getting imploded that night. I said, \"No it would have been in the newspaper for that.\" That night I looked in the news to see if anything that had exploded close or in the city that night and found nothing. The next day I went to work at McCarran International Airport and asked someone I know that works the night shift in the control tower and he said we had nothing in the skies capable of flying that fast the night before. So that left me puzzled, because so many people heard it and had had no clue what was flying over Las Vegas that night."],"Date of the Event":"03/05/2009 09:00 UTC"}
