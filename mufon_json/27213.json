My first reaction was that it was a helicopter, but she pointed out that there was no sound. We listened as it approached, but there was nothing. It approached from the northeast at what seemed a consistent elevation. The light was much brighter than anything other than a low-flying craft, but not quite steady in intensity. It didn���t have the green light, white headlight, or strobe of an airplane or helicopter. The light wasn���t a point-source, and had the quality of a fire, flickering irregularly. It was about 45 degrees above the horizon. Distance was hard to tell, but it seemed higher than a light craft. It traveled southwest a little faster than the speed of a satellite. The International Space Station came to mind, but I've seen that many times, and this was much brighter, very red, and clearly closer. We kept watching. It moved past north and away from us until it was northwest of us, and then it came to a full stop, about 20 degrees above the horizon. It held that position for several minutes and the light became more varied in intensity. My wife called our adult children outside, and although they didn���t see it move, they were quick to dismiss it as an aircraft (one of ours, anyway). Several minutes later, it began to move again, reversing direction at about the same speed, moving north, until it stopped again at almost due north. I was now a bit higher in the sky, but seemed farther away, higher in elevation, not as bright, and even more varied in intensity. It again remained motionless for several minutes, but continued dimming. At the point when I knew I was about to lose sight of it, it became white for a moment, and then it was gone. The incident lasted about 15-20 minutes. One week later, December 31st, I was alone outside and noticed a bright red light on the eastern horizon. We���d heard fireworks earlier, and although my first reaction was that it was the same object we���d seen the week before, I tried to explain it to myself as the trail of an aerial firework before it explodes. But it continued moving at a steady trajectory, was getting brighter and moving overhead. I ran inside to call my wife and grab my camera and we both watched the rest of it. It was brighter than the last time, more directly overhead, moving at about the same speed. It moved for about a minute. Then it stopped at about 60 degrees above the horizon just east of south, and over about thirty seconds dimmed out. Both times as it disappeared the feeling was that it was moving away, but it didn���t change position in the sky. There is modest light pollution in our area, but both nights were very clear. The video is from the second event. It is too high in the sky to get a point of reference, but during about the first half of this it is in motion, during the second half (about the time I moved the camera down to shift position) it was motionless. It's with a cheap camera, no zoom. Having looked now, we've noticed many recent videos of what appears to us to be the same thing."],"Date of the Event":"12/31/2010 10:33 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-116.208356","Latitude":"43.619961","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27213.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27213.html"],"Summary":"Two sightings a week apart, orange-red light","Object Shape":"Fireball, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.619961,+-116.208356(27213)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27213) map </A>"}
