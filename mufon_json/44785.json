{"divs":["Sighting DetailsObject crossed the sky like a satellite, but at about 45 degrees from horizon I could notice it was glowing and fading with a period of about 4 seconds. At 90 degrees, just above us, the frequency changed to a higher one and the object glowed twice. The object continued in the same course until it seemed to stop at about 45 degrees from E horizon. I could not see it anymore. As satellites do not glow and fade, or change speed, I presume it was some other device. The time was about half an hour after sunset. It really looked like those glowing dots seen on NASA movies made on ISS."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date of the Event":"12/25/2012 08:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/25/2012 08:13 UTC","Region":"Rio de Janeiro","Latitude":"-22.880766","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44785.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44785.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Niteroi","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"BR-12252012-0022","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-43.104335","Case Number":"44785","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-22.880766,+-43.104335(44785)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44785) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Crossed the night sky like a satellite, but glowing with variable frequency.","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Niteroi","Country":"Brazil"}
