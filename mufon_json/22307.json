I could see 2 lights when i looked through the binos. one on top was bright white in color the other was yelow white with red glow below and to the left of the white light. to the naked eye it appeared as one light, but with the binos there were 2 different lights. moved slowly to the east low on the horizon and disapeard, thought it was space station at first, but when i looked through the binos and saw 2 lights. i dont know what it was. the bottom light that was yellow and red center had more of a bowl shape on its side. very strange sighting. would like to know what it was."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22307.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
