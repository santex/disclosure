I thought, is this thing redder than Betelgeuse? I looked to the right and it was. It was nearly overhead, starlike It slowly changed to white, and I thought, Ok , its twinkling. It was motionless compared to the stars around it. Then it moved slowly to the southwest I said, OK its a plane. but no flashing strobes on the thousands of planes I have seen. OK, if it is a satellite it will move constantly to the south west. I lined it up with 2 stars and it moved southwest (slowly) It became red again It then curved back to the south east and the just to the south I watched it for 3 more minutes until i couldn't see it any more It disappeared in the south (never less than 30 degrees from horizon) It appeared High up. I am an amateur astronomer and have never seem anything I could not identify, ever."],"Log Number":"US-12262011-0019","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Summary":"lights in sky","Date of the Event":"12/24/2011 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/26/2011 09:54 UTC","City":"Woburn","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Woburn","There were no other sightings in Woburn on or around December 24th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34328.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34328.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Region":"Massachusetts","Case Number":"34328"}
