I usually take my time leaving the house, making certain I have everything I need because I live quite far out in the country. In hindsight, on that particular night I left the house very quickly - almost bolting out of the house; and I have no idea why I did that because I was only returning a pair of underwear to the store. If I had left 20 seconds later I would have missed what I was about to see. I was in my pickup truck, pulled out of the driveway heading west. In the western horizon I saw a very bright yellow light appeared; then two and three and so on until there were eight. My first quick thought was that they were landing lights from a plane until I started seeing more and realized how big these lights were. I immediately pulled off to the side of the road, turned off my radio, and stuck my head out the window. There were large orbs about the color of the moon. At first count there were seven; but after recounting I���m positive there were eight orbs. As fast as I counted the eight orbs, they had traveled across the sky in 20-30 seconds until they disappeared. The eight orbs took up almost ��� of the entire sky as they traveled. They were in-line and did not change their positions but weren���t spaced evenly apart. There were 2 - then a gap, then 3 - then a gap then 2 - another gap, then 1. The last orb was a little higher than all the others. As they passed over the field, they were approx. 300 yards away and 300-500 ft in altitude. My first solid impression was that this was a controlled flight and not anything man-made. There was no propulsion sound or sonic boom which I thought there would have been for something traveling as fast as they did. Immediately after they disappeared from sight I turned my truck around and followed where I thought they may have crashed; expecting to see a police road block or flames. After seeing nothing for a few miles, I decided to go to my friends��� house to tell them what had just happened. When I arrived Jim and Laura were reading. They knew something was wrong as soon as they saw me. I told them what happened and talked Jim into coming with me to investigate where these orbs may have gone. We went back to my house where I had first seen them in the sky - then drove east about 5 miles and didn���t see any sign of a crash. I took Jim back to his house and talked for awhile; then proceeded to K-Mart. I felt as though the cashier must have known something was wrong because I must have been very wide-eyed after seeing such an unusual thing. When I returned home I called Channel 4 News to ask if anyone else had reported anything strange in the sky. The answer was no. I went on-line and reported it on the UFO Alert Website. While searching that website I found an Astronomy student at the University of Toronto. I contacted him through his e-mail and he told me he had seen 7 orbs at the same time and place in the sky - he described them just as I had seen them. We wrote back and forth a few times but then lost touch. I no longer know how to contact him. The next night I went bowling with my friend Ken. When I told him this story his jaw dropped because Ken told me that earlier that day one of his employees sat him down and told him the exact same story I just told him. This employee lived in Akron, N.Y. The only difference was that his employee only saw 3-4 orbs. Ken gave me his employee���s phone number and we talked on the phone a few times. I no longer have his correct phone number but will contact Ken and ask him to try and get in touch with this man to see if he would be willing to talk to MUFON Field Investigators about his sighting. This was all I thought about for weeks afterwards; and since that time I have read numerous books on UFO���s and related topics. I keep an extensive dream journal; and have had lucid dreams in the past. On March 22, 1997 I had two out-of-body experiences. I don���t know where I went but it was extraordinary and amazing. I haven���t been able to repeat them since that time."],"Date Submitted":"07/28/2011 02:23 UTC","City":"New York"}
