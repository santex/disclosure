{"Latitude":"39.108218","Tags":"City","divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and i (son was sleeping in car seat) were driving on i-275 south(east) towards milford, ohio, a suburb of cincinnati. as i was driving south i looked up in the sky and a couple of miles ahead of me i saw a glowing orange sphere. i knew it was not a meteorite because i was driving for a good minute before i drove underneath it (and it was still hovering). i kept yelling to my wife in the back with the baby to look up and see it. she could not see it from her angle. i did not want to be the only person who saw this because the veracity of a sole witness is always a challenge. as we drove underneath the object i made the decision to turn on my hazards and hop on the shoulder. i have never pulled over for something like this before, as i have always been able to identify an object, until now. as i was slowing down i kept trying to look up and i almost hit the guardrail as i was pulling over. my wife yelled me to watch out. this did not make her happy since it was her car. as i stopped the car i opened the sunroof and said look! there it was just hovering above us. an orange glowing sphere. the time was 9:39pmest. it was difficult to determine its altitude and relative size. she thinks it was ���too high for a helicopter���, but i think it was only about 5000'-10,000���. it was the size of a (small) dime. of course you need to know the altitude to determine its actual size. it did not have any other colored lights on it. just an orange glowing \"sphere\". i should caution in calling it a sphere as we were unable to determine if it was disc\\egg shaped due to the glowing light. sphere matches the best visual description. the light did change in intensity but it was a very small fluctuation and could have been our eyes playing tricks on us. my wife and i were going through a detailed q&a trying to discern what it was. it was not moving, on any plane (x,y, or z). there were no conventional nav lights or beacons, there was no noise except for the highway, and my wife complaining to get us out of there because i woke my son up and they did not share the same enthusiasm and excitement. i did not want to leave because i wanted to wait and see it move. i wanted to see its propulsion. was it conventional or something unexplainable by our current understanding of technology? this would have filled in a great piece of the puzzle and possibly answered the question. very frustrated, i decided to heed the wife���s advice and get off the shoulder because we were not in a safe place on the road with traffic whizzing by us. after safely merging back on i-275, i immediately called my mother's house to tell them to run out front and look to the north a few miles and up (they are on the highest development around and would have a perfect view). my stepfather answered my call and ran to the front to take a look. he saw nothing. we reached exit 59 within a minute (milford parkway) and looked to our right (north). you could see a great amount of the horizon and we saw nothing. we arrived home about 5 minutes later, then i made calls to friends and family and now i���m typing this report. the credibility of the witnesses (my wife and i) are impeccable, as well as the intelligence and scientific backgrounds to make an unbiased observation. we are also well known and respected in the community. in addition i am an amateur astronomer and private pilot (not current) with exceptional knowledge of all active military aircraft in service (except of course current black projects). if it warrants an investigation, you have all of my contact information and can google and contact me. thank you."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.108218,+-84.50662(17281)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17281) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17281.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17281.html"],"City":"Cincinnati","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.50662","Summary":"Wife and I pulled off I-275 (on shoulder) to watch orange glowing sphere hover for 2 minutes.
