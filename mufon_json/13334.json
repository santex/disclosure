I saw three orange lights pretty close together flash one at a time. I stopped and kept looking. It happened again right around the same area. There were trees close to blocking my view, so I moved past the trees so I could see clear skies. Lower in the horizon, I saw it again, only in a different spot. 3 orange lights, 1, 2, 3, taking turns to flash one time before going completely dark. They were orange circles. I saw this happen 5 times total before I saw an aircraft that was surely an airplane of some sort flying through that area. After that I stood around looking for about 20 more minutes, saw a few more planes and that's all, nothing out of the ordinary! I know for sure that the orange lights I saw was NOT airplanes."],"Case Number":"13334","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Brownwood","There was one other sighting in Brownwood on or around October 28th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Sphere","City":"Brownwood","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/28/2008 07:35 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/28/2008 07:35 UTC","Summary":"orange circular lights over Brownwood","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10282008-0050","Longitude":"-98.989821","Latitude":"31.71352","Tags":"City"}
