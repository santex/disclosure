It was a fairly clear evening & I knew it would be passing overhead as Id watched it on flightradar24 all the way from Europe. I got my video ready and as it flew over me I started filming it. Not until I uploaded the video to my PC did I notice the object flying at speed behind UAE (United Arab Emirates) flight 39. There wasnt another plane visible in the area on flightradar so I am really not sure what on earth the other object is, a UFO? I will admit to being shocked when I watched the playback once it was on my pc... What surprised me is that due to the angle UAE 39 passed overhead its speed of about 200 mph is reduced so the other object must be passing behind at great speed.
