It just sits there motionless i couldnt zoom in with iphone after video started but had to record it... I did not move,,, a baloon would have been moving and would have poped im sure... But this orb sits for 5 minutes still as a rock,, then a plane comes in from right and it was heading toward the same direction as orb.. After the plane makes its way toward it , its gone in a blink........ Then from about same place and direction the plane was travelling 6-7 white small orbs seem to be making formation patterns following that same path form as plane theyvare way up in sky i imagine a mile higher than the plane was...
