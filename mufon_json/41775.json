{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside with some friend during a hot summer night, when i saw a light moving fast up in the sky. At first, i thaugh it was a satelite in low orbit reflecting the sun. But then i saw 3 more, all comming from different direction, and when they met, they've start doing geometrical figures across the sky. The event last several minutes (around half an hour) and most of my friends took time to look at it with me. From our point of view, they all seemed to be flying in space, probably in low orbit. Nothing else happened that night, but some years later, i met other people who saw the same thing the same night (as far as we could remmember). Taking for granted that we each saw the same event the same night, we took into account our different location (i was near Montreal Qc, one of my friend was in Qu���bec city and a 3rd one was in Sherbrooke Qc) and by triangulation, we estimated an altitude of somewhere around 5000 Km if i recall properly, so definitly in space. I'm puting it now 'cause i've never read anything related to that event and i wonder if more people have witnessed it."],"Summary":"4 UFO doing aerobatic figures in low orbit","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.543914,+-73.501923(41775)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41775) map </A>","City":"Longueuil","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Longueuil","There were no other sightings in Longueuil on or around July 15th 1994"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-73.501923","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-08152012-0017","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Quebec","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41775.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41775.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"41775","Latitude":"45.543914","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/15/1994 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/15/2012 02:26 UTC","Country":"Canada"}
