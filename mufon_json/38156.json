I was getting ready for bed and closing the window in our game room which faces West ( with North West view). I glanced out to the sidewalk and seen the UFO sitting in the sky. It was so bright. I yelled for my husband to come see it (he has never seen one before - city kid all his life). He came in and could not believe his eyes. I told him that was how UFOs look where I come from. It was difficult to tell if it was just glowing or pulsating as it was surprising to see here. It sat stationary. Felt like it was watching us - eerie feeling. We starred at it for a minute or more (not sure time) and the street light to the left of our home (across the street) began to blink and struggle to light. We glanced at the street light and my husband commented that it was blinking. Looked back at the UFO and it was gone - no sign of it. Checked ten minutes later before going to bed and no sign of the UFO."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38156.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38156.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
