I stepped outside to get some fresh air since I didn't smoke. When I was outside I noticed an orange light flickering a good distance away, brighter than most of the stars up. I didn't pay it much attention at first because hell looking at the night sky you can see a lot of stars with an orange color to them and they flicker. What caught my attention was when it jolted in a random pattern I got my cell out and started snapping some pictures I managed to get two pics before it was gone. It didn't move to a distance till it was out of sight but, more or less it just vanished after about 5 mins."],"Longitude":"-86.898498","trends":[""],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/23/2011 08:24 UTC","Case Number":"32812","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/10/2007 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"32.324341","Region":"Alabama","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed"}
