It was large enough to notice in the sky behind a group of trees. I said, Mil,do you see that!?! she said yes and we turned N onto Hope Street to follow it(itwas first sighted in the NW corner of the sky). We proceeded to follow it forthe next five blocks on Hope. During that time I rolled down my drivers sidewindow to better view it off to my left. In the time we followed it down Hopeit progresses from my left side to the middle of my front windshield (N)andcontinued to travel what looked like NE, decending slightly as it went.
