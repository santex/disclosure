There wasn't a star in the sky that night, which was disappointing because there was a meteor shower taking place. The lights seemed to come from behind the clouds, or just appear from nowhere, on my right side of the sky, which was probably East at the time. It flew in a straight line at a fast speed, but not quite as fast as a shooting star. It disappeared the way it appeared after flying across about half the sky in my field of vision - pretty much the exact middle section, directly above me. I did see a quick white light flash in the distance a while after that, but by then I'd taken my glasses off, so we'll assume that was a meteor."],"Date Submitted":"08/13/2012 11:40 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41708.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41708.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-73.789405","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.092405,+-73.789405(41708)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41708) map </A>","Summary":"triangle of white circles moving quickly across sky then disappearing like it appeared","Log Number":"US-08132012-0016","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"43.092405","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Case Number":"41708"}
