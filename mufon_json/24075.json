{"Longitude":"-81.686849","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsStopped for a smoke on the way to work, looked up, saw what I thought was a plane. Looked closely, it was a bright white disc, very high in the atmosphere, rather large in relation to how high this thing was. My guess is 40,000-60,000 feet based upon the average view of high altitude jetliners. What got me was that there were no wings or jet contrails and it was traveling oddly, seemingly on a descent. The object was traveling towards the south-southwest at a good clip, in a straight line. As I watched it several contrail-like trails were emitted from it at intervals, as if the craft was skipping along the sky. The object appeared to speed up as it traveled south and went beyond the tree tops. If you glanced at it, you thought it was a plane. If you looked closely, it was very different and difficult to explain. I'm no crazy and I know what planes, helicopters and other aerial phenomenon look like. This may have been terrestrial in origin, but it was very unidentified and unusual. Anyone else out there see this object?"],"trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Cleveland","There were no other sightings in Cleveland on or around July 1st 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-07012010-0012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.509195,+-81.686849(24075)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24075) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24075.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24075.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Region":"Ohio","Object Shape":"Disc","Date Submitted":"07/01/2010 09:40 UTC","Latitude":"41.509195","Summary":"Large white disc, high altitude, traveling south.","Date of the Event":"07/01/2010 08:34 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24075","City":"Cleveland"}
