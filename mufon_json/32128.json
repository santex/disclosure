These objects moved quite slowly for around 15 minutes, hovering from left across the sky, changing direction to right, and also up and down in the sky. I attempted to film on my mobile phone, but due to camera quality could not view anything worthwhile. The objects sometimes disappeared over the time period, but coming back after around 30 seconds. At the end of the sighting, the majority just faded but two of them shot off at high speed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32128.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32128.html"],"Case Number":"32128","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.517549,+-0.119005(32128)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32128) map </A>"}
