The best way I can describe the light is that it had a long tail with blue and red lights. We saw it shoot up into the sky at superfast speed. Then, with the same speed it disappeared into the sky, leaving no trail behind. This happened between Carrollton and Farmers Branch, Texas. I had never experienced anything like it. My husband and I both saw it and we have been thinking about it all day. At first we thought it could be a shooting star but this was shooting up not down. Could it be a UFO?"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
