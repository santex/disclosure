When we approahed the intersection of 41st. street we noticed a large fireball in the sky. It looked like the Moon on fire. It decended below tree level and was out of sight however a very very bright glow was comming from the area of descent. It was so bright that we noticed directly over the area a black helicopter hovering. We parked our car and wathched this for about 5 min more and then left the area feeling that we should stay not longer. A note of interest; when we got home and checked the weather there had been not storms in the area so I dont know what we were seeing when we thought we were seeing what appeared to be a lighting storm before the object was seen. There was a total of 2 people in the car that witnessed this."]}
