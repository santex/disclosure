I took 2 photos, in the first one you can see a speck in the distance of the approach, in the 2nd photo it is quite clear when slightly enlarged. I had been taking a photo of a barge and what it was towing. I have no idea what it is and showed it to other people and no one could id what it is. I'm hoping you can help.I took these photos from my hotel balcony at 4:07pm in Ormond Beach FL.I wasn't aware of the object while i was shooting the picture."]}
