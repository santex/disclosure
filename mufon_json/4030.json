she never saw or heard it. after about 50-60 seconds i could no longer see it, although based on the direction and speed it did not pass over a horizon to me or behind buildings or obstructions. recap\\notes: i first noticed the object because of the way it appeared so black\\gray against the stars and it's relatively low speed comparatively. the rings on the bottom were particularly unusual and unlike any aircraft i have ever seen or read about. while i studied the rings for 5-10 seconds, i became very aware of the very low, hum\\whoosh sound coming from it. the complete absense of interior or exterior lights or lumination or reflections was also noteworthy. every comparison i tried to make to known aircraft i dismissed instantly as particularly different, not just \"not quite the same.\" overall, i'm feeling somewhat concerned about this observation and its implications, which is probably why i'm making this filing. i have an engineering background, have been an aviation enthusiast for a long time, and am a keen and detailed observer. although i would prefer to have this object turn out to be a b-2, the only possible aircraft i am aware of it was similar to, it is not like the b-2 or any aircraft i know about produced or even just developed since the late 30's around the world."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"09/24/2005 09:14 UTC","Summary":"V-shaped object flying slowly at low altitude almost silently towards McDill AFB","Log Number":"US-10252005-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.959275,+-82.451308(4030)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4030) map </A>","Case Number":"4030"}
