CO., driving home from work when I looked up into the sky facing east. I saw what looked like a large red fire ball falling from the sky, I almost wrecked my car cause I thought a plane or helicopter was going down. Then I looked again and the fire ball split apart into 8 flying objects that were all lit up and they flew together across the sky, but not in a row but in a triangle formation and then they were gone that fast. Maybe they were fighters planes but I have never seen that may at once together. I definetly felt they were chasing something that fell from the sky. I checked the news but have heard nothing, thanks, what an awsome experience whatever it was."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.71104,+-105.078373(20414)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20414) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20414.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20414.html"],"Case Number":"20414","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/09/2009 06:20 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/09/2009 09:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-11092009-0022","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-105.078373"}
