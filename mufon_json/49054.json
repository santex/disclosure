On June 1 and 2 I observed the same thing. The moon was setting to the Northwest at approximately 3 am as i was going to bed. On July 17, the same thing, therefore, I thought it odd that there was a large fireball, reddish orange with a blue aura bobbing up and down and sideways. The moon was to the northwest, the object was to the southwest. The object bobbed up and down, sideways, etc. I watched for about 5 minutes and then it disappeared. Not sure where it was, but I live in Union County and can see to at least part of Franklin County to the southwest. It grew somewhat in size, then just disappeared. I would estimate that it may have been around the Batesville, Greensburg area from my vantage point."],"Date of the Event":"07/18/2013 02:47 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Longitude":"-85.213234","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07192013-0017","Latitude":"39.306141","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Batesville","There were no other sightings in Batesville on or around July 18th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49054.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49054.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/19/2013 11:26 UTC"}
