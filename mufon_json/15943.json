It was pretty high in the sky. It certainly was not a star, because it slowly moved around in the sky throughout the duration of our observations (about 2-3 hours). It was not a plane and not a helicopter. The light was intensely bright and pulsating. We viewed the object through binoculars- it seemed dense with vibrant color changing light. We attempted to drive to the object but it was difficult to pin point. I thought perhaps it might be a star, but I sit on my patio almost every night and have never seen anything in that position in the sky before. Also, the rate it was giving off light and changing colors was way too consistent and constant. And it relocated position. I am in awe of this object."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Pulsating light seen from my patio.
