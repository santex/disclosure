After about 2 sec I noticed that it was strobing red, blue, green and an almost neon white light. It was flashing in sequence at a very high speed. It was in the south sky from Bristol, with Orions belt about 10 degrees above to the right. My children and mother witnessed it. It was very slow moving, maybe 5 to 10 mph. I watched it for almost 3 hours moving west, before it made a more northern aproach. It was never out of view but definitely moved qute distance. Then around 12:45 the lights stopped strobing the colors, went to a solid bright white light and then was gone. Today at 9:40 pm we had witnessed same lights as the previous night to night there is 5 lights of the same exact description in the southern sky approx: 35 degrees up all five in same general vicinty of each other hovering for last hour and a half moving in a very slow western direction. till we lost sight of them."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.674915,+-72.917694(36628)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36628) map </A>","Latitude":"41.674915","Object Shape":"Disc","Region":"Connecticut","City":"Bristol","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36628.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36628.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03202012-0030","Longitude":"-72.917694","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City"}
