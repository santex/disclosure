However, when we noticed it was moving very slowly, we decided to keep an eye on it since planes don't move that slow and stars don't move at all. Over the course of twenty minutes it had moved up then to the side, gone down and back up again and continued a random up and down pattern, all while pulsating multicolored lights.My mom sister,and I grabbed our high power bonoculars to get a better picture of the object, we took turns looking at the object and I got a look at its definite shape for a few short seconds maybe 10 or so and quickly sketched it--it had a teardrop moon crescent shape. We felt overwhelmed with anxiousness to be witnessing such a thing and henceforth, decided to file this UFO report."],"Object Shape":"Teardrop","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida"}
