I saw a really really bright one with a small one next to it , thinking maybe it was venus but never saw a small one next to it before . I pointed it out to my son to look up at asking him what he thought and as he looked up too and I was still asking him what his thoughts were right underneath the star I thought was Venus, a bright ball of light appeared and got brighter and brigtter and brighter, and then very quickly took off, but within like 3- 4 seconds just dissapeared right before our eyes ! We both at the same time said \" did you see that? \" Neither of us have never before seen anything like this, definately not a plane, nor a shooting star or anything that I know of."]}
