He lives on top of a hill. He has seen theseUFOs before and he knows what time they come - 10 PM EST. So we were standingout in the yard waiting. We saw one. It was V-shaped and had lights that gotbrighter. It would hover at treetop level. It would go fast and then sometimesstop. The colors of the lights seemed to go from a white to a yellow.
