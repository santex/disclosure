Commercial planes were leaving contrail, these 2 large dull,gray objects appeared leaving no contrail in front of commercial planes out of nowhere and my friend and I watched them travel faster than the planes for around two minutes..The first object left our sight quickly but the other gray object was flying in front of the commercial aircraft. The objects had a large tail fin but no wings, made no noise and flew faster than the commercial aircrafts, my friend said did you see that? It gave us chills... Im military and know aircraft, and I have never seen nothing as fast and quiet as that! The commercial pilots had to see this too close up! This made me buy a strong zoom camcorder!!"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"08/06/2011 09:22 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.080105,+-79.788725(30499)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30499) map </A>","Longitude":"-79.788725","City":"Greensboro","Object Features":"Louvres","Latitude":"36.080105","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cylinder","Case Number":"30499","Summary":"Two Large Fast Gray Objects with Large Tail Fins","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08062011-0085","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30499.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30499.html"]}
