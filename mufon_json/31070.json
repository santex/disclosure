I looked past the treeline and said that it looked like someone lit a balloon on fire or something. As it got closer i couldn't identify it so I went ahead and used my smart phone to film it. It was originally kind of just a joke. After I zoomed in thats when I got a little creeped out. We watched it over and over until we decided to see what others thought. Surprisingly withing 24 hours it had been spread all over the internet. I contacted the local news (WSIL channel 3) that night. They called the next morning wanting to see the video, So I sent it to them. I haven't heard back from them. I honestly don't know what it is. Everyone keeps saying its a japanese lantern. All the video of those lanterns that I have researched all seem to go strait up... this is steady and slow. It then went off to the other side of the tree line and thats when we lost sight of it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31070.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31070.html"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.738287,+-88.922561(31070)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31070) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-88.922561","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08212011-0014","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON"}
