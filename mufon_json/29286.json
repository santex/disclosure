It traveled to the southeast until losing sight of it. I then looked to the south and noticed another orb amber orange in color traveling to the extreme south. there was a small airplane above the object traveling west. The plane turned out being a pretty good gauge of the objects position and size. I watched the object until it disappeared below the southern horizon. Activity in this area has been pretty low recently but it appears it's ramping up again."],"Longitude":"-114.046116","Latitude":"35.192143","Log Number":"US-05282011-0008","Date Submitted":"05/28/2011 12:54 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Kingman","There were no other sightings in Kingman on or around May 26th 2011"],"Tags":"City"}
