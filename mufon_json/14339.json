We noticed a yellow light apparently circling a fishing boats lights some 5 miles offshore.Soon after the light came toward usand within several minutes was directly over my group. he object resolved into a discabout 150 to 200 ft in diameter, no other lights or windows. It glowed a soft golden light6 sufficiently intense to illuminate the basalt sand for 75 yards around us, appearing as does a paper lantern. I cannot overstate the clarity of the sighting, had there been seams or rivets i would have noticed. NO sound, which was stunning in itself There was a smaller flattened dome at center, just like your prototypical hollywood flying saucer. I was scared but fascinated. The girls(2) were hysterical with fear and ran for the truck, parked a half-mile away. You don't run in sand for long and the object followed us at our pace. 10 minutes later we r3eached the truck and I remember thinking I know the car won't start. It did, to my suprise.I then used the cars mirror to see if it appeared in reflection. It did. I refused to leave though allo of us had the sensation of our minds being probed. I know that sounds wacky but there it is. After another3 or 4 minutes the vehicle, for that is what it was, lifted straight into the sky and became star sized in a matter of 10 seconds or so, then blinking out. Again, no sound, sonic boom, contrail or heat signature at all.I am a retired marine engineer with a masters in electrical engineering and a solid grounding in the sciences and since that night have had no doubts about life in the universe."],"Case Number":"14339","Log Number":"US-12102008-0011","Longitude":"-124.05983","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in shelter cove","There were no other sightings in shelter cove on or around July 11th 1972"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14339.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14339.html"],"Object Features":"Dome","Latitude":"40.027243","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/11/1972 09:30 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"150ft. diameter golden disc at 250ft. altitude stopped over our position on beach.
