They were heading in a southeasterly direction towards the ocean at about 30 mph. They were a brilliant orange in color and were the size of a quarter at arms length. There was approximately 1000 feet between each of the orange ���balls���. There was a slight altitude difference between one ���ball��� and the next but the distance separating each ball was the same. They were all generally flying on the same flight path. They kept coming one after the other and we estimate between 6 and 8 of the orange ���balls���. I was able to snap 2 photos but no video because of a dead battery. After I had called my son and wife outside and they were able to see what I was seeing, I took my son with me in the car to try to get a closer look. As we were driving we saw the last one heading towards Long Island. I got out of my car and tried to get a photo but it was too late. Before the last one was out of sight, it seemed to get 2 to 3 times brighter and then just shoot off. These orange balls were first sighted in my backyard in West Haven, CT and we followed them about ��� mile to the West Haven shore before they headed out towards Long Island. I watch the sky almost every night and have never seen anything like this before. My wife was actually a little upset after this incident. It was definately not fireworks or planes or helicopters, I���m absolutely sure. We just want to know what it was."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.309763,+-72.919128(17885)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17885) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Connecticut","Latitude":"41.309763","City":"New Haven","Longitude":"-72.919128","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 10:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-07062009-0030","Tags":"City","Summary":"Witnessed between 6-8 glowing orange \"balls\" in loose formation.","Disposition":"IFO"}
