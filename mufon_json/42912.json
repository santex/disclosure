When I noticed them, I slowed my car to a crawl, turned down my headlights, and kept watch on them, so slow in fact that a stretch of road that takes 30 seconds typically I went down for five minutes. They appeared to be far in the distance, over north central Lawrence, and judging from the angle, tree lines, and light pollution, the triangular formation appeared to be massive. After the five minutes of watching, they abruptly blinked out. I first noticed it because after my first sighting last year, I tend to watch the skies. My first reaction wasn't to what it could be, but it's size. I felt in my gut that the distance between the lights was far. I thought for a moment then that they could be aircraft, just due to incredulity, but after noticing how still they were, I became certain I wasn't looking at anything I had seen before. The moment I saw it my hair stood up on end, and after the initial shock and taking stock, I somehow felt it necessary to lock my doors. Towards the tail end of my sighting, I called it in to a podcast I subscribe to, since they said us listeners should do so."],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.981249,+-95.22555(42912)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42912) map </A>","Case Number":"42912","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Lawrence","There were no other sightings in Lawrence on or around September 29th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42912.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42912.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
