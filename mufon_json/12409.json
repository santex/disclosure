It was very high and slightly dimmer than most other stars. I kept looking and sighted another one(starlike as well) going north west. And again one moving south again. It could have been the same thing, but they all seemed to fade. Lasted per sighting about 40 seconds a piece. And then to top it all off I came back out to watch the skies again around 10:25, and sighted three starlike UFOs in a triangle formation. I've seen these before, this one was moving steadily south and eventually slowed and faded. The triangle held its formation very tightly, and eventually faded after it had slowed down. The triangle sighting lasted about 3 minutes."],"Tags":"City","Region":"Michigan","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/09/2008 12:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/09/2008 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.603178,+-84.757844(12409)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12409) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.603178","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12409.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12409.html"],"City":"Mt Pleasant","Longitude":"-84.757844","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
