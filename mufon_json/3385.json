I was just out in the yard having a smoke with a good friend whe we saw it. It flew from east to west really fast. I noticed it had a dark oval shape and was travelling probably beneath the clouds or maybe just amonmg the lower layers There were 4 lights and 2 were changing colors (very bright pinks and greens). It was larger than a jet and probably a bit more than twice as fast as one. As it sped of it made a LOOOOOOOOO noise."],"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Canton","There were no other sightings in Canton on or around March 20th 2005"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/20/2005 02:13 UTC","Case Number":"3385","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.804457","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-81.376177","Summary":"Not Provided","City":"Canton"}
