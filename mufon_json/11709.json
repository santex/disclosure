{"trends":[],"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting Details This close encounter happen outside a very small municipality of Bellefeuille situated near the City of Saint-J���rome, approximated 5 miles North-Est of the International Airport of Mirabel. For the first time, I go alone there at the back of a very small camping, to see friends and my arrival was in the afternoon Saturday the 16 June 1978 and I was suppose to came back in Montr���al the Sunday morning. I decide to go to sleep in the back seat of my old Ambassador!!! at 02h30 A.M. but before that, I decide to smoke a last cigarette in front of my wheel. At my arrival at the camping, I park my car in front of a m���tal chain who block the access for tractor, genre John Deer , to a on way road dirt of 7 feets wide to farmers or some kind of 3 tires bikes, and this one track road have tree both sides and this small road has also an angle of 30 degrees upscale, on a distance of about 75 feets where you see part of the sky, and you arrive to a kind of a upscale plateau who was in fact a sand carri���rre of 100 feets large by 150 feets deep and in less than 10 secondes by foot, you have the access of this plateau BUT I DID NOT GO THERE OR HEARD ABOUT IT SINCE MY ARRIVAL AT THE CAMPING. I was strangely thinking about this sp���cific place was an excellent one to see a U.F.O. ( Remember the film of Spielberg Close encounter have a big impact the summer before ) by it's location and the fact it was my first time there. I said to myself to stop to think about to see U.F.O. because when it will happening, I will know it !!! and less than ONE SECOND !!! , a white flash appear in the rigth corner of my windshield !!!. After each three or four seconds an another flash, and so forth aND each is very white, the brigthiest I ever seen in my life ( genre halogene with very high density ) and the white flash is bigger than what we can see today on planes. First,I think it was an h���lico who was going very low from the North to the South, so I get out and run quickly upstairs on this plateau realising I hear NO NOISE !!!. On the plateau I was surprise to see the flash of the invisible object was coming back to the North in a pendullum kind of descent ( like a leaf who fall from a tree )and the pendullum movement go back in forth North and South for 3 or 4 minutes in this beautiful summer nigth without clouds but I don't remember see the moon. I most tell I was fascinated and happy and the absence of any noise remarquable !!!. During the descent of the U.F.O. I look to my rigth and the small road was gone up 5 feets in a no specific direction because I never move until the object REVEALED ITSELF WHEN ARRIVE NEAR THE THE TREES ON THE HORIZON, approximitely 250 feets. Reveale itself because when after it seem 3 minutes of the pendulling descent and the ligth will surely disapear at this rate in less than 30 seconds, I said to myself what I will do after the invisible object will be lower than the top of the trees, the flash became A CRESCENT OF A MULTITUDE OF COLOURS, grenn - bleu - red - orange - violet, and others without now any flassing !!! it was beautiful but I start to get scare. After one minute to seeing this small crescent ( if I put my hand in extension it was half an inch large and the distance according to the line of trees in the horizon could be around half a mile while the pendullum descent start probably 1000 feets high, the U.F.O. was already low. After roughly one minute, I decide then to go \" IN THE WOODS WITHOUT ANY KIND OF SPOTLIGTH AND I MAKE A COUPLE OF WALKING STEPS AND THE VISITOR OF THE DARKNESS AUTOMATIQUELY GET BIGGER 150% ( LIKE ONE INCH IN A HALF WITH MY FINGERS IN EXTENSION !!! ) so it was an object very big, probably more than 100 feets wide and 10 feets high and THAN I BECAME VERY UNCONFORTABLE FACING ALONE !!!!! THE UNKNOWN and the U.F.O. continue his descent after I retreat 5 feets backwards and 30 seconds later it was no luminescence of the presence of the ship behind the trees so I decide to go to my car and ask my friend Michel to came with me find it-them BUT his fiancee said you will be hijacked and disapear for ever so i decide to go in the morning there BECAUSE Michel said to me one of his friend go on the plateau a couple weeks before and he take the small road who go in the woods and in les then 5 minutes you arrive to an Hydro - Qu���bec electricity line and around 9hA.M. I go there alone and ... If I decide to make public for the first time, it's because since 2008 I start to listen Georges Lowry coast to coast A.M. and he give informations last nigth about the San - Jos��� 39e M.U.F.U.N.convention."],"Longitude":"-73.543546","Country":"Canada","Sighting Duration":"00:05:30","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.945506,+-73.543546(11709)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11709) map </A>","Summary":"Brigth white light flashing each 3 secondes with no form until it's change in a multicolours crescent","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"52.945506","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Quebec","Date Submitted":"06/17/1978 02:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"11709","Date of the Event":"06/17/1978 02:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-07242008-0016","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11709.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11709.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Flash, Other"}
