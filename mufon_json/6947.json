{"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"6947","Longitude":"-85.595284","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Log Number":"US-05012007-0010","trends":[""],"divs":["Sighting Details All I saw were the lights no other image. But considering the angle of the lights, I figured it to be a circled object. The object did not seem to be moving. The lights came on and went off in the same location. It was a clear evening. I saw no stars or any other objects in the sky. But let me say this, these lights were VERY bright. They were so bright surely someone else had seen them. I am not sure of the altitude, but I would guess the object was about 100 feet in the air. How long I viewed it? Well, I stepped outside and the lights caught my attention, I noticed 2 lights close together. I don���t know how long they had been on but they were the 2 lights on the top. I thought, my gosh those planes are too close they are going to crash. But also thinking those are some bright lights. I walked into the grassy area of the yard (about 10 feet) to get a better look and that is when the 3rd light below the 2 on top came on. I at that second thought \"what the heck\" and it was at that point the other 5 lights came on. I quickly (maybe 5 huge steps) went inside the doorway and yelled for my husband to come quick. I turned back and looked at the lights and they went out. Unfortunatly my husband did not see it at all. I stood outside, walked around looking in the sky only to find nothing, not a plane, not a star, not a cloud. Nothing at all was in the sky. These lights were so bright, I am surprised that no one else has mentioned it or that it was not on the news. I watched the news that evening and in the morning and nothing was mentioned. Nothing in the paper. Has anyone else reported this sighting? I am not sure of the objects I saw. But I can surely say that it is something I have never seen before and I have nothing to compare it to. Attached picture of the triangle was not taken by me. I found it on line and it is very similar if not exact to what I saw. The second image is the actual location of what I saw. I used a paint program to draw in the object. It doesn't give it justice but it offers an idea to the image."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.557226,+-85.595284(6947)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6947) map </A>","Date of the Event":"04/24/2007 12:00 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.557226","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6947.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6947_submitter_file1__triangle.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6947_submitter_file2__UFO.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6947.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/24/2007 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"began with 2 lights and then a 3rd came on making a shape of a triangle. after a couple of seconds a partial circle of five lights came on beneath the triangle.
