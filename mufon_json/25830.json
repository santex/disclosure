{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at my job at this time. One of the men i work with was outside at break. He called me outside to view a bright blue light in the sky. It was located in the north north-eastern part. The light was a bright blue, it hovered close to the horizon then would shoot upward. It would bob from side to side. At times the light grew brighter and then would fade to almost nothing. At one time it elongated to a tube and then moved back to a round shape. One of the men thought that it was a romote control craft. But i didn't think that they had that kind of range as it would go up higher in the sky. We all had to return inside to continute our jobs. We were all curious as to what it could have been."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-86.303348","City":"Plymouth","Date Submitted":"10/12/2010 12:27 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25830.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25830.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/11/2010 07:55 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"bright blue light that moved quickly and erratically.","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Plymouth","There were no other sightings in Plymouth on or around October 11th 2010"],"Latitude":"41.351655","Log Number":"US-10122010-0001","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.351655,+-86.303348(25830)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25830) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Case Number":"25830","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
