My friend and I were baffled because there was a moment when they seemed to hover for a few seconds, then started to to move slowly from northeast to southwest at about approximately 40 mph. The breeze at the time was going from west to east so we knew they were NOT balloons. I ran as fast as I could inside to get my camera, and snapped 4 shots of them. The objects were black in color and had a semi-round appearance, until they would tilt sideways and were flat like a pancake. They continued southwest for approximately 10 miles, or until we could no longer see them. All the while they were tilting, or rotating."],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"26438","Region":"Colorado","Log Number":"US-11082010-0018","Summary":"Standing with friend in backyard 2 UFO's flew over us.
