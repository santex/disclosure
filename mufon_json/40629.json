It was fairly low ascending south-southwest. We moved out onto the driveway to watch it as it ascended until it was out of sight. We notice a slight, distant humming noise as it went by, starting a little after it was past us. We have an airport south of us and see airplanes go in and out all the time. The direction of ascension of this orb did not fit with where the airport is. Also, airplanes always have blinking lights, and this was entirely an orange glow. It went at a steady pace in a direct line until it was no longer in sight, beyond the stars. There was no cloud cover at the time."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40629.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/40629_submitter_file1__orb20120708220139.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40629.html"],"Region":"Iowa","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/09/2012 11:31 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
