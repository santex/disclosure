{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt's been appearing a few times during the past ten days. It's cigar-shaped, with something like a ball in the middle. It glows yellowish-orange, like fire, and moves fast. Sometimes it emits sparks. A few times it came very close, and seemed to be witht the size of a car. Other times it can be seen in the distance as a very big yellow star that moves, then stops, sometimes changes direction. Before it disappears, it blinks a few times, as with each blinking it becomes smaller. A source whom I can trust informed me that such objects belong to the military. I don't mention the city where it's seen on purpose. I still don't have any pics of it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"BG-03192011-0022","Date of the Event":"03/15/2011 12:00 UTC","City":"Mexico City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"Mexico","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Cigar, Fireball","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-99.144898","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Mexico City","There were no other sightings in Mexico City on or around March 15th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"03/19/2011 05:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28309.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28309.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"A cigar shaped object glowing yellow and emitting sparks","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.361265,+-99.144898(28309)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28309) map </A>","Region":"Distrito Federal","Case Number":"28309","Latitude":"19.361265"}
