We stopped to take two pictures of a spectacular sunset..two days later the photos were uploaded and one the two photos was saved as a new wall paper for my computer. I saw a spot on what I thought was the monitor thinking it was a speck of dust. With further zoom-ins it was clear that it wasn't a pixel problem or dust on the lens. The most puzzling of the two photos is of the black orb. The other figure is up and to the right of a bird in flight. Both are puzzling and we would like a good explanation."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31661.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31661_submitter_file1__sunset.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31661_submitter_file2__SUNSET1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31661_submitter_file3__ufo3a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31661.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-111.064536","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Summary":"spherical object","Log Number":"US-09082011-0027","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/08/2011 11:56 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.707866,+-111.064536(31661)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31661) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"31.707866"}
