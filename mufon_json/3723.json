At that point I knew it wasn���t a plane and I called my roommate he told me to get his video camera which I did. When I got back outside, this thing had moved to the south east. It was my first time using it and I spent most of that hour trying to get as much video as I could which I did the video didn���t come out as good as I had hoped. I had problems keeping the camera still when it was zoomed in on this object. But you can clearly see this thing wasn���t a plane and it changes shape. At one point I saw a commercial airliner fly right past this thing. I wish I had got that on tape but I didn���t. The pilot had to have seen this thing. My roommate (He is a network manager for an architectural company) came home at 7:30pm I pointed this thing out to him although this thing was further away at this time and he agrees with me this thing was no plane and neither he nor I could explain it. The object kept moving to the southeast and we wanted to see if we could see this object on the tape so we went inside to check it out. I found this kind of Interesting after the fact I realized that this object where it was first seen for about the first 10 minutes was directly over a A Bio gas Conversion project Landfill its where they collect Methane gas and other gases from the decomposing waste and converts it to reusable power."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Region":"California","Longitude":"-119.416572","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.783301,+-119.416572(3723)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3723) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3723","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3723.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3723.html"]}
