Rushmore for vacation. We were going to the monument from Custer State Park, which is a very winding and narrow road. We made the curve (which will be shown in the pictures) and this is when we first saw the huge monument. We were probably 2-3 miles from the parking area when I first took the pictures. Being that far from the mountain while taking these pictures, we were unable to see the \"objects\" and of course didn't know if they made noise or not. Please take a look at the three pictures I am enclosing. The first picture was taken and nothing shows up. The second picture, however, shows some unusual egg shaped object and other darker, blacker objects. The last picture is of the second picture with an enlarged pic of the egg shaped object. Maybe ET just wanted a view of our \"National Treasure\". ��� I sent a letter to COST TO COST, but I haven't seen my pictures posted there and have not heard from them. Maybe it's nothing, but I am posting the pictures here anyway. Thanks."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:00","Object Shape":"Egg, Other","Latitude":"43.977175","Longitude":"-99.896753","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/20/2008 11:15 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/20/2008 11:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11345.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11345_submitter_file1__DSC_0001.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11345_submitter_file2__DSC_0002.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11345_submitter_file3__mtrushmore.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11345.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06292008-0008","trends":[""],"Region":"South Dakota","Summary":"Possible UFO at Mt.
