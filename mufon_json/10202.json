On Friday April 4, 2008, my friend and I were leaving Hoover Dam site and had just crossed into Arizona on Hwy 93 toward Kingman. About 20 miles into Arizona I was adjusting ny seat and as I leaned forward I was compelled to look up and saw about 75 to 100 objects above the cirrus clouds. As the clouds passed underneath the objects, they disappeared and then reappeared. They disappeared in total and reappeared in total. They were very large, and at about 25,000 to 30,000 ft altitude, they had to be at least 100 feet across, maybe more, each one. They were about the same altitude as jets could fly. This lasted from 3 to 5 minutes and when I had an opportunity to pull the car over and get a better look, they were gone. The friend with me is a MUFON Field Investigator and estimated along with me that the objects were at least 20,ooo to 30,000 ft overhead from my description."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-114.044036","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Kingman","There were no other sightings in Kingman on or around April 4th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","City":"Kingman","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10202.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10202.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10202.html"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere","Case Number":"10202","Latitude":"35.192763","Summary":"75 to 100 objects appeared overhead, above cirrus clouds","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04082008-0002","Tags":"City","Region":"Arizona"}
