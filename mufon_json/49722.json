I looked at first a laughed and teased him about them being UFO's, but then as I was watching them I realized it was a single triangle shaped object. It was massive in size judging from the distance it was from us Im estimating there was at least 1000 feet between the lights. it was moving very slow and it made no noise, it came from the NE and made a slow turn to the south, as it turned the lights seemed to disappear one at a time till we couldn't see it anymore. the whole event lasted about 5 minutes, the whole time my boss was saying what the hell is that thing."],"Date of the Event":"08/10/2013 09:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Portsmouth","There were no other sightings in Portsmouth on or around August 10th 2013"],"Case Number":"49722","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-71.214615","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49722.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49722.html"],"Log Number":"US-08112013-0020","City":"Portsmouth","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.625759,+-71.214615(49722)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49722) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
