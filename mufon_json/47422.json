{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Ottawa","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsGot home from watching hockey game around 10pm (sens lost) May 15, 2013. Had to take out the garbage, so I walked across the street to see what recycle box the neighbour's put out. I was walking back to my house, looking east I noticed a number of white objects flying west, I thought at first it was Canadian Geese flying because they are always in a triangle, but then I realized it was night, so I focused in closer and realized it was about 6-7 lights forming a triangle. I wasn't sure if it was one object, but then it turned and veered north and went behind a large tree. All the lights stayed in position so I assume it was one object. I then ran down the street a bit to see if it would appear on the other side of the tree but nothing. If I had to guess, it looked like it was 2-5 miles away, 3500 feet up, but can't be sure. There was a plane directly overhead as well (looked like 30,000 ft.), which I kept looking at to make sure I wasn't seeing things."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-75.695933","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.42873,+-75.695933(47422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47422) map </A>","Summary":"Moving triangle of lights that changed direction","Log Number":"CA-05152013-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47422.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47422.html"],"trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Ottawa","There were no other sightings in Ottawa on or around May 14th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ontario","Date Submitted":"05/15/2013 10:26 UTC","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"45.42873","Date of the Event":"05/14/2013 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"47422","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
