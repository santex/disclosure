I haven't found anyone reporting on this but I find it really hard to believe that noone saw this, so I'm reporting it to see if anyone replies and validates this (I'm pretty skeptical of UFO's): Here's what we saw: My family and I were driving east on Yorba Linda Blvd about 8:15pm. One of my kids said with surprise to look out our windows up in sky to our left (north). There were 15+ orange-ish lights at about 1000 ft (hard to really tell) heading south-southwest. At first we thought it was a fleet of helicopters. As we drove the lights began to disappear 1 to 2 at a time. Not quite sure if they were fading out or turning and heaidng another direction. There was a plane that went by (the LAX flight path is in that direction) so I was able to get a little more perspective on the distance and altitude. The best way to explain them is that they looked like sparks from a campfire fire after you stoke it. Same orange-ish color, but these were lights. and were not acending up, but moving forward in somewhat unison. By the time I pulled over in a parking lot to get a good look at them there were about 5 or so left. We looked around to see if there were any other people observing, but didn't see anyone. Otherwise I would have ran up to them to help validate what we were seeing. I pulled out my phone to take a video or picture, but by that time there was only one left. It seemed to get brighter and slow down, then it too eventually left. About 2 or so minutes had lapsed from the time we first saw them. Hopefully someone out there saw this too and has some sort of logical explanation. I don't want to be one of those people that says they saw something and everyone thinks they're nuts! thanks"],"City":"Brea","Latitude":"33.92403","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04132012-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37426.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37426.html"],"Summary":"15 Orange Lights spotted over Brea, Orange County","Date Submitted":"04/13/2012 12:26 UTC"}
