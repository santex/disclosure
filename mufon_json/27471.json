Being a clear sky, I was admiring the cosmos, like I always do. I started seeing several,\"traveling stars\", or starlike Ufos. I took the dog in and grabbed my wife. She watched, for a few seconds, got cold and went back inside. I had told our neighbors across the street that the next time I see multipel strange lights, I would come get them. I took of across the road and glanced to the west. I then observed the big starlike object coming directly toward their house. I opened the door and yelled for them to hurry out. at this time, the object was almost, directly overhead. We all watched it go overhead and over the next door neighbors house. I then dimmed from, an almost blinding light, to suddenly an amber color then totally disappered. This thing was the the size of the full moon."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.674648","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","Region":"Indiana","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"01/21/2011 05:24 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"walking across the street to the neighbors, looked up, and saw a HUGE starlike object coming from the west.","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Shipshewana","There were no other sightings in Shipshewana on or around December 21st 2010"]}
