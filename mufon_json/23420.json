I was just watching the sky and I noticed this light it was very bright and did not move. I thought it might be the evening star as it did not move. It appeared at times to have flashing colored lights. It was above the flight pattern for planes to land at Los Angeles Internation Airport. I called my husband and he watched it, then we got the binoculars out, but could not get a clear enough pictures to identify what it was. It did not appear to be a plane, helicopter or blimp. We watched it for over two hours it did not move during that time. At that point we just went to bed. I called the L A sheriff's dept. they had no idea. I tried contacting KNX1070 could only get the traffic department. I sent an email to NBC no reponse. There you go."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
