I was looking northeast when something caught my eye moving to the south. I turned and viewed an amorphous mass of nothing for about 1 minute moving toward the southern horizon at a high rate of speed. It passed behind a group of trees and based on previous viewing of aircraft landing and taking off at a nearby airport, I would place the altitude at between 500 to 1000 meters. The object quickly accelerated and vanished toward the southern horizon. The object had no identifiable shape other than blob-like and an empty grey color. It was like looking into a hole that you cannot see the bottom of but as it moved it did block out the stars behind it. My son saw 'something' but was looking in a slightly different direction from me so I cannot say he saw the same object. Having seen aircraft and helicopters in the same area during the day and night I can safely say this was not an aircraft of any design. In fact I think I would be safe in saying it was not a structured object at all."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"34631","Log Number":"US-01052012-0016","Summary":"grey amorphous mass","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34631.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34631.html"],"City":"South Bend","Longitude":"-86.29039","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/05/2012 03:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/05/2012 04:40 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
