I generally check out the sky, while they dotheir sniffing and I noticed a slow moving object that didnt seem plane shaped. As it came closer. I could only see the lights - a triangle of 3 white with ared in the center. It seemed quite high up and as it came overhead I heard ahum rather than a plane sound. As it passed, a plane came into view flying kindof perpendicular to it but I think much lower. Unfortunately several cars camepast around that time so it became noisy and I couldnt hear it any longer. Itspossible its one of ours. I just noticed it because the shape was unusual andit seemed to be doing more of what I would describe as a slow glide and then thehum, rather than a typical plane sound."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.497604,+-74.488487(2443)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2443) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/20/2003 09:25 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Triangle in Somerset, NJ","Log Number":""}
