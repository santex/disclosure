I repositioned myself and noticed it was unlike any aircraft I had seen, in person, before. It was a large aircraft, though size cannot be determined since it was dark and I live in Maine, therefore there is no frame of reference as to size, speed, or altitude. I can say for sure that the aircraft DID emit a sound very similar to that of a jet engine, yet muffled. The craft was triangular in shape, with three (3) white lights, one at each point of the triangle, and one (1) or two (2) red lights dead-center. The craft was in my field of view for approximately 10-15 seconds. The two things that struck me as most odd were that none of the lights were blinking and there was no apparent attempt to evade public view."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"16537","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Belfast","There were no other sightings in Belfast on or around April 16th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.433739,+-68.998543(16537)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16537) map </A>","Longitude":"-68.998543","Source":"MUFON"}
