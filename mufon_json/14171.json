{"Region":"Utah","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile stopped on the side of the road (off or rt 80) to take some photos of area. We notices a fleet of objects in the sky (moving from north(northeast) heading South(southwest) over 70 objects kept changing formation (mostly in pairs) forming half-circular shape to \"L\" shape and other random formations. I was able to take several photos of the event with my professional 16.6 Mega-pixel camera and a 100mm lens. Even though objects are not 100% clear, once i zoom in on the image, I can come to a definite conclusion that these were un-winged objects (spheres)."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"14171","Date of the Event":"11/25/2008 10:58 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/25/2008 10:58 UTC","City":"Grantsville","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14171.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14171.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.599942,+-112.464399(14171)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14171) map </A>","Latitude":"40.599942","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Grantsville","There were no other sightings in Grantsville on or around November 25th 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"Multiple spheres moving and changing formation.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12012008-0003","Longitude":"-112.464399"}
