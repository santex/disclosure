It is in the area where \"Jupiter\" would be and we used the same telescope in the past to view Jupiter which was entirely different. This object had the same description of the investigator in Kentucky. It had what seemed like a small black nucleus with \"spikes\" of different colors shooting out from the center. It moved or swayed and the colors were predominately yellow to green then blue then purple. The spikes seemed to shift. A dinner guest went outside with me to view it also...he described it as a pattern of a \"Kiwi\" cut in half. I was not the only one who saw this. Clouds were moving in so no picture is available. Thank you for your time..."],"Latitude":"43.123955","Date of the Event":"02/18/2012 12:00 UTC"}
