{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving on Hualipai heading west near Alta Drive and in the south west sky, just above the mountains I noticed a white fireball looking object. It looked like it was heading towards earth very slowly. I noticed two jets, the ones with the long trail heading towards the thing I saw...one was heading towards it going east to west and the other jet was heading towards it from west to east. It appeared to be by the Spring Mountains. I watched it as long as i could but then it disapeared behind buildings. I wanted to go and check it out more closely but I needed to get home. I am just very curious about it because of the meteor that was in Russia today and also the meteor that came close to Earth today."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"45719","Summary":"White fireball-like object seen over southwest mountains of las vegas nv","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-115.169246","Region":"Nevada","City":"Las Vegas","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were 2 other sightings in Las Vegas on or around February 15th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.120296,+-115.169246(45719)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45719) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02152013-0013","Date Submitted":"02/15/2013 06:29 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","Latitude":"36.120296","Date of the Event":"02/15/2013 12:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45719.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45719.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
