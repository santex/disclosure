Upon closer inspection it seemed to be moving ever so slightly like a firefly. I called my roomate to look and as soon as she came it started releasing little white glowing orbs then two glowing objects shot accross the sky at high speed zig zagging along.They covered the entire sky in about 3 seconds the made an abrupt 90 degree turn without slowing down. Also 3 balls of light formed a triangle then became one then dissappeared reappearing somewhere a short distance away.It almost looked like projectiles were being fired back and forth between different objects but they were too far away to tell for sure. This went on for hours before I went to bed at about 4 a.m."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Starlike object flashing red blue and green moving in sky then shooting acroos the sky at high speed making sharp turns.","Tags":"City"}
