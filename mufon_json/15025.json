(one accelerated from a dead stop to a speed barely visible to the eye). a couple of sightings appeared to be similar to nighttime aircraft with landing lights on and more than a dozen strobes, except the craft remained motionless in the sky for several minutes and then moved very slowly with no sound present. all sightings were observed during clear skies. the latest sighting follows: on 12\\30\\08, i observed what appeared to be a small military fighter jet flying low over town at 3:40pm. (military aircraft are rare here, however three earlier sightings were followed quickly by the appearance of military aircraft). after eating dinner, i went outside at 4:30pm and counted eight contrails in the sky at one time. i figured i missed the show as 2-3 contrails are normally the most seen at once around here in six months of skywatching. the next day (12\\31\\08), i went outside at 4:00pm and soon saw a very high large dark colored jet (possibly a b-52) flying overhead heading east leaving a contrail. as i watched the jet nearly straight overhead, i observed what i thought was something dropping off the aircraft. the object that appeared to separate from the jet appeared to be a silver ball about 1\\3 the size of the jet. the object appeared to be sightly lower than the jet and it���������s contrail and was stationary in the sky for over five minutes with a 5-10 mph wind coming from the south at ground level. i could not tell if the object actually came from the jet or just appeared very near it when i first observed it. i observed the object with 5x binoculars, and it still appeared to be a high altitude stationary silver ball. i attempted to videotape the object but i was not able to locate it in the viewfinder before it disappeared."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/31/2008 04:00 UTC","Longitude":"-93.24456","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Westlake","There were no other sightings in Westlake on or around December 31st 2008"],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15025.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15025.html"]}
