I tried to tell if the light was a nebula or star, but realized there is no nebula or star that is this low to the horizon. The light did not move. It remained on for about 10 seconds after I spotted it, and then it suddenly blinked out, like a light switch turned it off. I kept looking at the spot I had seen the light, and then it reappeared in about 2 seconds, only it had moved (horizontally) in what appeared to be a northerly direction, the distance of about 1 foot from my line of sight, remaining at around 20 degrees from the horizon. The light remained on for about 10 more seconds and again suddenly blinked out as it had before. (There is no way I can explain exactly how far it actually moved). I left the area to get my video camera and videotaped the area of sky for the next 10 minutes, but it never reappeared."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Windy","Case Number":"22668","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04062010-0007","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Ranger","There were no other sightings in Ranger on or around April 5th 2010"]}
