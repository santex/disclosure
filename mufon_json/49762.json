{"Latitude":"39.520977","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar, Diamond, Triangle","Summary":"UFO with bright lights seen in western skies of CO last night","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsObserved bright lights in western sky--just above mountain range. With naked eye it looked as though it was 1 object and with binoculars it was likely two objects; 1 appearing bigger than another. The lights were magnificently bright and would change sequentially displaying all colors of the rainbow. I am going to see if our cameras caught anything but doubtful. I drew a picture of it--diamond shaped with diamond squares displaying bright colors--it seemed to be communicating with the smaller object next to it. It hovered for about 20 minutes then it moved south eventually disappearing. Definitely not a plane, star or planet. We got our kids out of bed so they could observe it. So cool!!!"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Region":"Colorado","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49762.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49762.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/11/2013 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.520977,+-104.930132(49762)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49762) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/12/2013 12:44 UTC","City":"Littleton","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"49762","Longitude":"-104.930132","Log Number":"US-08122013-0014","trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Littleton","There were no other sightings in Littleton on or around August 11th 2013"]}
