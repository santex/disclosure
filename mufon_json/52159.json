My youngest daughter (19) came in the house around 6:50 PM to tell me they were back. When I went outside I did observe an light south of my location. It first appeared it was moving our way, but would occasionally fade out, then it seemed to move away from us. I did manage to take a picture and some video this time. The object was quite a distance from me. The light was fairly steady but would fade on occasion, before moving out of my sight. This did take place and was visible for about 35 - 40 minutes."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Woonsocket","Case Number":"52159","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
