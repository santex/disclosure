{"Case Number":"24237","Object Shape":"Fireball","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was visiting my friends cottage near Caseville, MI for the 4th of July holiday. I was sitting inside in their garage facing north towards the back of their garage where I just happened to be glancing out the back door. Fireworks had just begun going off all around the area as it was beginning to get dark. I noticed two bright orange balls of light moving eastward at a very low altitude as they crossed the opening of the doorway. My first instinct is that it was a malfunctioning firework. I went through the door to watch it further and observed these 2 bright orange lights flying closeby at a very low altitude. They made no noise, and continued their trajectory until one of them descended below the treeline. The other one continued to be visible for another minute or two before going out of sight."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 08:52 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"2 orange fireballs moving east over Lake Huron near Caseville, MI7/4/10.","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07052010-0086","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Caseville","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24237.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24237.html"],"Longitude":"-83.271347","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.941125,+-83.271347(24237)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24237) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"43.941125","City":"Caseville","Object Features":"None"}
