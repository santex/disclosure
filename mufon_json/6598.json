I have been watching oil +energy politics for the past twenty years and have studied it's history.I'm aware of the current administrations intent and need to maintain the fossil fuel status quo,their climate changing vested interest.They'd have us all driving SUV's if they could ,while feeding us lies to scare us into war to maintain the status quo."],"Date Submitted":"03/31/1992 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Los Angeles","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-03212007-0006"}
