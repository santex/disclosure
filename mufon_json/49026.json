At first I saw just one object coming in from the northeast, I thought it was a plane on fire, then seconds later there was another one. They both seemed to stop, hovered for 45 seconds or so, and flew away going southeast, then seemed to have disappeared. 2-3 minutes later a third one comes, also from the northeast, going the same route the previous 2 went, this time without stopping or hovering. I do have video footage but I don't want to leave it here. If someone from MUFON contacts me, I will send them the footage."],"Longitude":"-75.621799","Tags":"City"}
