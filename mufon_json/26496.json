My mother had a co-worker today tell her that she saw a UFO last night (11-8-10) that appeared to be a very large glowing red light with smaller red lights moving around it. She said that it was just sitting there and then noticed 3 aircraft approaching or following it. She then said that it started moving in one direction slowly and then stopped for a second and then moved the opposite direction. It stopped again and then disappeared. This women is located in Doney Park just east of Flagstaff and at the base of Mount Elden and the San Francisco Peaks. I do not know what direction in the sky this took place. I have told my mom to have the lady report her sighting here.. so hopefully she will. There is also a report of someone seeing 8 foot tall creatures on the mountain here on the 7th of November. This ladies husband also saw the event and had binoculars with him. He believed it to be a military exercise while his wife did not think so. There is no military installation housing aircraft anywhere near flagstaff."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26496.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26496.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.210902,+-111.637379(26496)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26496) map </A>","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arizona","Latitude":"35.210902","Date Submitted":"11/10/2010 06:33 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/08/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Summary":"Large Red Light followed by Jets"}
