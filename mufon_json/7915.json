I could not judge the direction. It moved towards the mountain range (Franklin Mountains). Very fast, very bright, on the larger side, since I could see it through the city lights. The sky was clear. It may have not been a UFO, but I cannot identify it. I had no particular feelings at the time. I work as a delivery driver, and was returning from a delivery from Ft. Bliss, coming across the bridge from the gate. When I saw the object, I remembered to write down the time when I next stopped. I am not sure if anyone else noticed it."],"Latitude":"31.76312","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in El Paso","There were no other sightings in El Paso on or around September 14th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.76312,+-106.481911(7915)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7915) map </A>","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Flash, Star-like","Longitude":"-106.481911","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7915.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7915.html"],"Tags":"City","City":"El Paso","Date Submitted":"09/14/2007 09:12 UTC","Summary":"possibly a falling piece of debris or \"shooting star\"","Case Number":"7915"}
