There was not a single cloud in the sky. Approximately 10-15 workers surrounded the window to see and try to understand what they were observing. After several minutes, the object could no longer be seen as the sun began to rise above the mountains. Several witness agreed that it looked like a cross, or perhaps the silhouette of a person with arms extended outward. To date no one has come any logical explanation of what we all witnessed."]}
