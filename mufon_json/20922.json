I noticed a star moving from the south going north. It looked like a statelite but then all of a sudden it turned around and headed back towards the south. It was traveling somewhat slow but then would speed up and was not going straight. It would surve around kind of as it went. It also would become brighter at times then duller again. We were very curious as we did not understand it's flight path. It took about 10 to 12 minutes to fly by both ways and then it just dissapeared over the hills. We were not afraid just very curious. It was about the size of a star."],"Date of the Event":"12/07/2009 06:02 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-122.320828","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Washington","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12082009-0008"}
