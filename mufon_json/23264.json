I looked up when i saw what was a shooting star, as i looked up i realized what was up there was much bigger and much closer than a shooting star.. and it continued to glow. I stared up at it and it didn't seem like it was very high up at all above me maybe only 100ft. But if it was only 100 ft in the air then it couldn't have been much larger than a big beach ball. it moved in short but fast bursts with no sound kind of like how a squid moves through the water. The sphere glided right over my head and in about 15-20 seconds it sped off quickly behind a small hill. It seems lame but I swear I got the feeling it was looking at me."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
