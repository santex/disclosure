{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWife was standing outside and observed a dark object moving across the sky from the back on our house. I was in the shower at the time and wasn't able to observe the object. She was sure what the object was because she couldn't see any lights of hear sound. We do live West of the airport and a lot of planes fly over, but this object was dark with zero lights and sound. She said that it was a dark blimp looking object moving from the South and heading Northeast across the sky. It didn't have any lights or windows that she could see. The object moved out of sight behind trees that are located to the North of my property."],"City":"South Bend","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50371.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50371.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in South Bend","There were no other sightings in South Bend on or around September 1st 2013"],"Date of the Event":"09/01/2013 09:15 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-09022013-0015","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.724238","Summary":"Black mass moving across sky heading NE","Object Shape":"Blimp, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.724238,+-86.362755(50371)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50371) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/02/2013 01:41 UTC","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-86.362755","Case Number":"50371"}
