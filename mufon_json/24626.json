I was walking with my head down through a nearby Vons parking lot. When I picked up my head I thought at first I saw 3 black crows flying. Then I realized one of those crows was a UFO. It was entering a field where railroad tracks used to be. It was traveling to the far left of the field. It was all black, and about 20 feet long. It looked like thin panels with semi-circles in the front and back of it. The center of it had a large dome. It was rectangular with short curtains of whatever material in the front and back. It was about 1\" thick all around. I watched the object as it approached a main street. It traveled at 2 to 3 mph. When it crossed the main street it continued on through another field. I soon lost sight of it as it disappeared into some fog or midst."],"trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Anaheim","There were no other sightings in Anaheim on or around October 18th 1989"],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Hoax","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24626.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24626.html"]}
