Then me and my friends (6 people all together) saw that it was rather a fleet of strange blue lights, some bright some not so bright maybe a hundred of them or more traveling south bound over Itokent Urla. They were moving unhurriedly but quite fast for an object of such altitude. They had the bouyoncy of balloons. But some of them had very sharp blue lights shining. They traveled southbound and disappeared unhurriedly. The blue light parade lasted about 5 minutes before it disappeared."],"Summary":"A fleet of blue lights flickering and moving south in a sort of disorderly manner.","Log Number":"TR-06252010-0016","Latitude":"38.41885","Region":"Izmir","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"27.12872","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
