(the persieds(?) are over aren't they?)maybe whoever is flying up there likes to watch the afternoon traffic...it's a very busy area...it's location was approximately above denton hwy.\\basswood in fort worth.(both times)"],"Date of the Event":"08/19/2009 06:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.861936","Longitude":"-97.244847","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Region":"Texas"}
