{"Object Features":"None","City":"Lexington","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"US-08092012-0011","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friends and I were sitting outside on July 4th watching the fireworks which were about 350 yards away. Off to the right of the fireworks I saw a bright orange orb or fireball moving steadily from left to right. Directly after that, another one, exactly the same, appeared and followed the first one's exact path so that both were briefly visable at the same time. They looked like two huge basketballs on fire. I would say they were about 70 feet above us. They disappeared over and behind a building in less than 30 seconds. My friend sitting next to me saw the exact same thing. The other two people with us had a somewhat obstructed view and did not see anything."],"Longitude":"-84.500747","Region":"Kentucky","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Lexington","There was one other sighting in Lexington on or around July 4th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.050907,+-84.500747(41584)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41584) map </A>","Summary":"2 bright orange orbs","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Fireball","Case Number":"41584","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41584.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41584.html"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.050907","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/09/2012 12:51 UTC"}
