So I was taking my dog for a walk at about 5pm, on my way in I saw a plane in the sky that drew my attention, then coming down is what i thought a shooting star that crossed paths with the plane. it keeps slowly flying across the sky downwards as the plane flies into the distance, but then the thing just stops and pulsates a light and starts going up suddenly! Then it flew to the right and i watched it for about 10 minutes just staring in suspicion. And then after i had been watching it slowly move in a straight line, it stopped moving and just started bouncing slightly, or what appeared as it \"shaking\". I just stopped staring and came in, quite freaked out."],"trends":["There have been 53 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around December 11th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"33969","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.16609,+-77.605142(33969)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33969) map </A>","Summary":"At first i thought it was a shooting star,m but then it stopped and flew up and then to the right and its direction changed.","Date Submitted":"12/11/2011 09:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-77.605142","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"43.16609","Log Number":"US-12112011-0014","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/11/2011 05:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"New York"}
