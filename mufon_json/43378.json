Almost exactly a year apart of the first sighting. Was driving South towards home, looked up to see a star like object low to the ground. appeared to be close and couldn't possibly be a star. I came up to it as it hovered over a school on the road. When directly under it the white star like beam was diminished. Triangular in shape with a different color at each point. No sound. Maybe 100 or so feet directly above me before it disappeared while I attempted to get out my camera phone. Appeared approximately a half mile away, same colors before changing to a solid red before blinking red. I had turned around and was facing North at this time. I called my mom who lives in the area it had gone. 2nd witness. She acquired a grained camera phone photo. She watched it as it changed direction several times, I could no longer see the object. 3-4 more came and joined with the lone ufo. All hovering above the ground now at approx a mile above. They circled each other for a bit before moving off. Total observation time 1 hour. Can send photo upon request."],"Latitude":"40.216234","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43378.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43378.html"],"Case Number":"43378","Date of the Event":"10/17/2012 07:15 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Source":"MUFON","City":"Stevens","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Stevens","There were no other sightings in Stevens on or around October 17th 2012"],"Tags":"City"}
