We live in the hill country and the sky was very clear that evening. I noticed a bright light in the north east, thinking it might be a star. It was much, much brighter than the other stars and began to move very quickly both vertically and horizontally. The lights seemed to pulsate, and the vehicle moved at rapid speeds. I couldn't take my eyes off it as it was unlike anything I have ever observed in the night sky. It lasted about 10-15 minutes and disappeared."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Helotes"}
