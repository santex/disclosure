The sky was mostly cloudy the night before but clear at that time. After a few seconds, I noticed a star like object moving from West to East. The object was very high in the sky and could easily be confused with a star. The light emanating from the object was solid white, and did not blink. The movement was at a constant speed and there was no sound. The object moved in a straight line as if it had a fixed path. When the object was almost away from my sight, I noticed another object with the same characteristics moving in the opposite direction (East to West). As the object moved about halfway of my scope of view, another object appeared moving from North to South. The objects were observed for about five minutes until they were no longer visible."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Bridgeport","Longitude":"-73.185347","Region":"Connecticut","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.195148,+-73.185347(18465)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18465) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"08/03/2009 03:46 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.195148","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Three start like objects moving in different directions","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Bridgeport","There were no other sightings in Bridgeport on or around August 3rd 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18465.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18465.html"],"Log Number":"US-08042009-0002","Case Number":"18465"}
