I first thaught it could be military but there were no flashing lights. All of the sudden the one closest to the ground curved upwards toward the one above, merged into one entity and began to pulsate. It was like a mile high strobe light. What happened next is completely irrational in human terms. The object began to move up and down vertically at a speed unknown to man and faster than anything i have ever scene. I ran inside and dragged my poor mother outside by her arm. By then the object had slowed down and it disappeared over the mountain in a westerly fashion. Freaked out and in disbelief I countinued to observe what looked like flashes of lightning for an hour or so, although there were no clouds and the nearest thunderstorm activity was hundreds of miles away in Kentucky. I've been looking up for years and feel it necessary to report this dramatic event. God be with us all."],"Case Number":"31085","Longitude":"-86.573197","Date Submitted":"08/22/2011 10:04 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31085.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31085.html"],"Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[],"Log Number":"US-08222011-0007","Summary":"Two red orbs appeared from the east moving west at the same rate of speed, became one pulsating orb that changed directions and disappeared to the west.","Date of the Event":"08/21/2011 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.522241,+-86.573197(31085)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31085) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
