I continued down the road and it started moving down very fast and 4 distinct lights appeared on the corners in the shape of a diamond. I kept watching it until it disappeared behind the treeline, and then watched it move back up. I was very excited to see this because I have been following UFO cases for 3 years now and I finally get to see one."],"trends":[""],"Log Number":"US-06192008-0011","Date of the Event":"06/19/2008 09:20 UTC"}
