It was just after 6pm when I first noticed the object. It was just becoming dark. I thought it was an airplane. But the color was wrong and the light wasn't blinking. I should also mention that it was also over a lake. I was partially in the woods so I lost it a few times through the branches. It seemed to be coming towards me when it stopped. It hovered in the air for about a minute and then headed off to my left. I then lost it through the trees. I felt no ill effects before, during, or after the encounter. Nor did I experience any time distortions. Only I, that I know of, saw the object."]}
