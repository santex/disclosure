I ran inside to get my family and by the time we got out of the house the object had moved and disappeared. It reappeared South about 2-3 miles away. It was hovering over a field at about the same height. There were military jets in the area, we counted four of them. We couldn't tell what type the jets were, but we could hear them. The jets came from the West and as they came near the orange light, which was round and about as big as our house, the light disappeared. The entire incident took about 1 minute or less. Nothing appeared in the sky after the jets left the area. W took some video of the object."],"Log Number":"US-11112008-0005","City":"Dublin","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.089093,+-98.336288(13661)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13661) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-98.336288","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dublin","There were 3 other sightings in Dublin on or around October 23rd 2008"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"I was outside our house and I saw a big orange light 400' to 500' above our house."}
