His Mother met me in the driveway and we were chatting, standing outside of my vehicle. I noticed an orange glowing orb flying past, going from east to west. I mentioned to my son's Mother that it was a UFO. She then noticed a second orb of the same color and size about 30 secs later flying in the same direction at the same altitude.
