mother, my grandmother would fly me from edmonton canada to bellingham washington where she would pick me up for the summer,then fly me home and i would live with my grandmother when my home life was unfavorable. anyhow it was early in the summer because it was warm enough to sleep under the stars i'm pretty certain i was about to turn 9 years old and at the time was taking horse riding lessons from the lyons approx 1\\4 mile up on the left from my grandmothers property.she had a son about 3 or 4 years older than me an a daughter a few years older than him.(please keep in mind i am 30 years old now and don't have a-lot of exact details i wish i did)i remember i was excited to have a sleep over, because of my constant relocating\\moving i was able to make few long term friends as a child, estacada was the only place i lived frequently as a child, so i don't remember much about that particular day until we were laying in the sleeping bags staring at the clouds, very evenly covering the sky with small gaps not very thick at all infact i remember watching them pass in front of the moon and still being able to see the craters an the moons white glow coming through, theres a name for these clouds i just don't know it, i remember talking with them until they both fell asleep , now 7 miles out of estacada in the hills on the edge of the skinner loop valley elevation around 3000ft so these clouds are close like i wanna say 100 ft. maybe a little more above my perception could be off but i could recreate exactly what i saw with the right tools,so i'm just watching the moon n clouds wondering if its gonna rain when a large round green light zips over just above the clouds completely silent, it didn't even break wind, the light \\glow strong enough to come through the clouds and its moving faster than anything i've ever seen, it does a straight line across the horizon ,which i can see for miles on the hill, disappearing behind the tree line, if i had to guess i'd say it was approx. 100ft wide perfectly circular and somewhat sphereish but more disc shaped. it crossed the horizon in less than a second. i have always been very aware of my surroundings and the way the world works i can remember cursing god at the age of 4 for the things i was going through at home, by the age of 5 and none of my prayers had been answered i swore him off all together, in the second grade i can remember the counselors walking the halls with me asking me why i spoke the way i did and acted like someone well beyond my years and was never able to connect and play with children my age,by the 7th \\8th grade they wanted me to take 12grade reading and english to prepare taking college classes in high school i imagine i could find witnesses to all of this, but not to that night, i woke both of them extremely excited and tried to explain what i saw, they both insisted i was dreaming and told me to go back to sleep. that might have lasted about ten minutes and i remember being angry that they did not believe me and now i could'n sleep i knew what planes looked like and i had seen shooting stars this was absolutely neither, as i was laying there stewing over there disbelief the same object at the same speed came directly overhead again just above the cloud line this time doing a perfect 90degree zigzag, there was no change in speed when it turned and this time maybe took just under 2 seconds to cross the horizon. at this point i was completely convinced i saw what i saw, i knew no aircraft known to the public could move like that, i didn't bother waking up the lyons children again i layed restless an somewhat afraid until sometime in the early morning when i fell asleep, when i awoke the lyons children had gone in the house an i was really wet, turns out it did rain later that night and they went in and left me out there which was poopy because i was very prone to swimmers ear with horrible infections, i told many friends about that experience and even the next morning went and asked my grandfather about ufo's. my grandfather jim lyons was a retired marine merchant mechanic that served full term in the military and served in japan in ww2. he killed many men the only reason i know that is because i heard him scream about it in his sleep every night, my grandmother n him slept in separate rooms because of this, blood curdling commands an screams for help, telling people to leave other people and on and on. he was always the authority and never joked unless he was telling an actual joke, i always looked to him for moral guidance as my father figures were less than worthy and i knew it, and when i told him what i saw his answer floored me. all he said was \"o yea they used to land in the valley when i was a kid\" in his slightly raspy calm voice i asked what they where doing and he did not answer. we never spoke about it again. he passed on 2 years ago. so 5 or 6 years past and who would become one of my best friends moved to town in the 7th grade his parents baught the property next door closer to ours. being my age and close by it made sense to hang out. i kept my distance being a towny and knowing everyone a little i wanted to see how he faired, sure enough his first day another friend of mine beats him up for a comment he made to a girl after she had said something rude, anyhow his folks took initiative and invited me to go skating with him (through my grandmother) and i agreed, that night was interesting aswell but long story short we became good friends and i got my buddies to lay off him as much as i could (anyone from a small town knows outsiders have to earn there welcome)so this movie comes out a few years ago called \"the fourth kind\" and its not the best movie ever but it gives me chills to my core like i've never felt and then i get curious an start seeing all this ancient alien stuff and want my friends to see this movie to see if anyone reacts the same. well my buddy watches it with me and he sais \"he's not to convinced an it was ok but - do i remember that night in the orchard (we used to sleep over an stay in a tent so we could smoke cigarettes n chew tobacco with out the grandparents seeing or his folks) in the tent an that light filled the tent\" i replied \"no?\"he then proceeded to tell me about a night when we were up late talking bout girls or whatever and a light so bright filled the tent he could hardly see me , he checked outside the tent afterward and saw nothing, when he told me that i got the same feeling i got during the movie and tried to remember and it hit me, i did remember the light but only the instant it came, and discussing it after with him was a blur, he said we talked about it in length. i could'n get much more information out of him but i know where the tent was and were 7 miles out of town on a rural road on 20 acres in an orchard 300yards from any driveway or road. the light i'm trying to describe is more intense than a dozen event spot lights. i would really like to under go hypnosis to try and remember this night i feel like there's more to this story. i can show exactly where i was for both these events, unfortunately at this time for legal reasons my buddy will have to remain anonymous but i am absolutely certain in the near future he would tell his side if i asked neither of us really care for attention outside our close circle of friends. thank you for your time"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Case Number":"38367","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/10/1989 12:00
