I went to open the window because it got cool out and noticed an extremely bright light in the sky. It looked like a star but WAY too close. I observed it for about 2 minutes before I went and got my binoculars. Once I saw it through the specs I knew I had to try and film it. I have seen this kind of thing before here and I live very close to picatinny arsenal. Is it something from there? I don't know. I got my camera and it had power... Once I saw it zoomed and closer I knew this was no star or airplane. I definitely felt relieved that I caught it on tape because I knew none of my friends would believe me. So in the A.M. I will get it uploaded and send it on over. It was still there when my tape ran out."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Summary":"10pm looked out my bathroom window and saw a VERY bright light (not moving)","Longitude":"-74.473564","Region":"New Jersey","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.798777,+-74.473564(7164)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7164) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown"}
