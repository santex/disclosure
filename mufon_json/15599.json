Several times during last year when I would pull up the webcam (during the day) there would be unusual objects in the sky. I did save several of the photos to our computer server. (Unfortunately, there was a huge flood in the building where the server was kept and I lost all the photos that were saved. It was a very freak flood that we have spent over 5 months and many thousands of dollars recovering from.) Keep checking the webcam!"],"Date of the Event":"06/30/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc, Oval","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02192009-0015","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.082458","Date Submitted":"06/30/2008 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Wyoming","Summary":"Concerning the Old Faithful Webcam","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15599.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15599.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-107.280344","Case Number":"15599"}
