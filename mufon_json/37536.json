We work at a hotel in West Chester PA and I wasnt going going to report this until I saw that the same lights appeared in Texas City a few days later. These lights would appear and then disappear and at 1 point we counted 22 of them. They didnt seem to have any direction but they were reddish orange in color. As far as the reaction well, you can clearly hear that on the video. The video is a little shaky but in the beginning of the first video, you can really see them. The second video was shot towards the end of the sighting and if you watch long enouph at the one light, you will suddenly see a second light appear under it. They looked like they were spining or something. I cant explain it but Im still freaked out about it."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-75.592269"}
