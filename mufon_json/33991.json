As they were driving home they noticed what they believed to be a shooting star or even a possible meteorite falling from the sky. Only they told me they had never seen one so bright, and there was apparently no trail, as most meteorites leave in their wake. They usually look to the night sky, having seen many unidentified flying objects of various shapes and sizes in their lifetime. The object shot across the sky in an arch, and then straight towards the Earth, no longer visible. The color was a very bright starlike white and orange mix. To me it sounded very much like an incident witnessed by my entire family in January of 2010. We watched four brilliant orange objects one behind the other slowly rising into the sky, glowing with a great inteansity before rising so high they were no longer visible."],"Date Submitted":"12/12/2011 09:27 UTC","Latitude":"41.00388","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-12122011-0017","Longitude":"-80.334268","Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in New Castle","There was one other sighting in New Castle on or around December 9th 2011"]}
