Tonight I saw one single orange (very bright) sphere high in the sky it was very fast, no more than 5 minutes later a helicopter flew over my house heading in the same direction. My guess is that someone reported it or they knew it was in the air space but it was freaky.... Two nights in a row. Anyway if anyone else has any more reports from Scotland or the Paisley area I would love to hear them.
