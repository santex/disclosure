{"Case Number":"25810","Summary":"UNKNOWN SHAPED OBJECT WITH LARGE BLUE LIGHT ON ONE SIDE AND RED LIGHT ON OTHER SIDE","divs":["Sighting DetailsI WAS DRIVING NORTH ON I 205 AT AROUND 8PM. I NOTICED 2 LARGE LIGHTS ONE BLUE AND ONE RED SIDE BY SIDE THAT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING ABOVE AN OVERPASS. I LOST SIGHT OF IT AS I WENT UNDER THE OVERPASS. WHEN I PASSED UNDER THE OVERPASS, THE LIGHTS WERE VISABLE AGAIN. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE LIGHTS ON AN AIRPLANE, BUT THEN THE LIGHTS SUDDENLY MOVED WEST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT THEN SEEMED TO TURN NORTH. THEN THE LIGHTS WENT BACK AND FORTH WEST TO EAST. I LITERALLY WAS DUMBFOUNDED AS I OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT ONE MINUTE. I PASSED THE OBJECT AT THIS POUNT, BUT I COULD SEE IT IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR FOR ANOTHER 30 SECOND. THEN IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT. THERE IS NO WAY IT WAS AN AIRPLANE OR A HELICOPTER. THERE WAS HEAVY TRAFFIC ON I 205 AT THE TIME. OTHER PEOPLE MUST HAVE SEEN IT ALSO.I WAS AWESTRUCK FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES, AS I TRIED TO WRAP MY MIND AROUND WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN."],"Region":"Oregon","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Clackamas","There were no other sightings in Clackamas on or around"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-10112010-0005","City":"Clackamas","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.561839","Latitude":"45.41565","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25810.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25810.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/11/2010 05:28 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.41565,+-122.561839(25810)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25810) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
