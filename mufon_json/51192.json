But being familiar with constellations I knew these were not stars. When then observed them moving towards us. They appeared as 2 lights in formation which could have been 2 miles apart from each other. But the moving lights were synchronized as if a single object with a solid white light on each end but no visible structure in the middle. The object then descended below the mountain line and dissapeared."],"Summary":"While taking astro-photos observed 2 lights in formation moving together as if one object.","Longitude":"-120.54076","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51192.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51192.html"],"Region":"California","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mountain Ranch","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/29/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
