{"Region":"Illinois","divs":["Sighting DetailsTalking on the telephone to my daughter in Wisconsin when I noticed a very unusual object in the sky. There were red and white lights and the shape was a large V. It was moving from the east to west at a slow rate of speed then picked up speed and left quickly. Never have seen anything like this and told my daughter while I was watching it. I was married to a retired USAF Major. I know planes and this was very odd. Not a planet, it was moving, it was low in the sky and quite large. Motion was steady until it increased in speed. I was calm and told my daughter about the event. Object should still be moving west over the country right now."],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.635875,+-89.394428(3611)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3611) map </A>","Longitude":"-89.394428","Log Number":"US-07202005-0004","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3611.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3611.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"very large object, not an aircraft, moving over Paxton at 915PM.","Date of the Event":"07/20/2005 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Date Submitted":"07/20/2005 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.635875","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3611"}
