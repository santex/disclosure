{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving on Hwy 49 from Nevada City going toward Grass Valley about 2:30pm when I saw a big, bright white, glowing cylinder object that appeared to be hovering above the trees at a slant. This \"rod\" type object was about two inches at arm's length in the southeast direction. As I continued driving and keeping an eye on it, I lost sight of it from the trees. I tried to locate it and then came around on the road and saw a very low, flat, \"squished\" cloud-like object that was about 8 inches to a foot long at arm's length. It was the weirdest thing since there wasn't a cloud in the sky and the weather was gorgeous. I only saw that cloud-like thing for a minute and then lost sight of that from the trees. I tried to take pictures but it was difficult while driving."],"Longitude":"-121.014229","Latitude":"39.267161","Date Submitted":"03/05/2012 11:16 UTC","Log Number":"US-03052012-0019","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.267161,+-121.014229(36273)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36273) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36273.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36273.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:13:00","Summary":"I was driving on Hwy 49 and saw a bright, glowing cylinder shaped object hovering.","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Nevada City","There were no other sightings in Nevada City on or around March 4th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Nevada City","Date of the Event":"03/04/2012 02:32 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"36273"}
