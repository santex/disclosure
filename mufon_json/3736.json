I was going back inside when I saw a white metallic speck right over my head. my first impression was that it was just an airline jet at a high altitude, but it was moving way to slow. then it just stopped there. suddenly, it started moving again. I thought that was kinda strange so I got inside and got my digital camera and proceded outside to take a picture of it. The object was oval shaped and was moving towards the south. I took two pictures of it and then it just faded out and disappeared as if it evaporated."],"Longitude":"-82.112864","City":"Plant City","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"3736","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.018632,+-82.112864(3736)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3736) map </A>"}
