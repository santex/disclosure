{"Latitude":"32.647457","divs":["sighting detailssaturday september 17, 2011 4:31am: i went outside, was on 2nd floor balcony, which faces due south, smoking a cigarette before i went to sleep, wasn't looking into sky, was looking straight ahead into next apartment building breezeway. a small non-flashing, red light (like a led light or power indicator light) came into my field of vision, i wasn���t looking up at the sky or anything. it captured my interest because i thought it was flying extremely low, must be a helicopter? don���t see many helicopters in this neighborhood unless it���s the law chasing somebody & if that were the case, there would have been searchlights. plane? where���s the flashing? also don���t they have white lights as well? also, there was no sound whatsoever. the sky was clear, however it had rained for the 1st time in over four months most of the day before. the air was humid & thick. what i saw was hauling *** (word removed cms 09\\18\\11 14:32 cst flg), faster than anything i've seen. it remained at the same elevation, heading from my right to left diagonal path. as it grew closer, i noticed some sort of circular type field around the red light in center. the circle was translucent & it was glistening\\shimmering opalecant colors. not twinkling like christmas lights, not blink pattern at all. there were also i think 6 rays surrounding the opal circle, shining from the circular field, all the same length, just about the length of the circle in size. i simply couldn't take my eyes off it, i then remembered i had my android mobile in my hand, so i hit the buttons to quickly try to capture it on digital. it took me 5 seconds to get it started, by then; the object was straight above me. i tried to get it in my viewfinder, but it was moving so quickly, i just couldn't keep up. i attempted 3 shots 8 seconds apart, i've no flash & the lens was on the full zoom out level. it then was out of my view once it flew over the building. i ran down the stairs trying to adjust the zoom in, got to ground level & my view was blocked by the building. i should have run to the street, but i didn't think of it, i was so amazed! i felt no fear of the object. i gave up & went upstairs & indoors. then i looked to see what i might have gotten on digital, but with no luck, just darkness. i went to sleep. i woke up @ 10am & the 1st thing went thru my mind was the event. i plan to upload the photos onto my computer & see if i can find anything by resizing them.
