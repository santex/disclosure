When the director told us to sit down, we did, and while I was listening I looked to my left. I saw a Spherical object slowly going low across the sky. It made 1 stop, then kept going in the same direction. I felt happy. This is not the first time I have seen it. It usually appears when I am in a good mood. I lost sight of it when it went below the horizon."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.870503,+-85.638729(21585)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21585) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-01222010-0001","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"A spherical object moving slowly across the sky."}
