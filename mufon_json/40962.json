Two of the lights faded out while one continued. Two more lights rose up and faded out rather quickly while the third light remained bright and began to move Westerly (toward me) then drift down and to the South followed by a slow change in direction to the North. Finally it descended and became so dim you couldn't see it anymore."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-118.514798","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around July 19th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Los Angeles","Summary":"Three lights that initially formed a triangular shape, then moved independently.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.272104","Date Submitted":"07/20/2012 11:22 UTC"}
