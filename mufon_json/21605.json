That doesn't look like a plain? my boyfriend & josh look up & all of a sudden these bright blue lights are alternating and making these weird shifts & the object is \"floating\" sideways & at the same time as if it was jumping up and down & side to side in straight lines extremely fast, we stood in aww then called everyone out saying there was a ufo & no one believed us until they walked out & immediately jaws dropped staring, like no one could think because we were just in shock not wanting to pull our eyes away even for a second. Someone out of all of us had the sense of mind to record it on her phone & a few days later on facebook everyone there that night was tagged in the video. The girl who took the video on her phone would have the exact time & date recorded."],"Summary":"We have footage.","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Minneapolis","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.257046","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO"}
