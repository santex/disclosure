So we went out on my patio and in the sky we saw a fireball like thing. At first I thought of a plane unfire. But it kept moving and was really moving fast. It was not like it was being carried by the wind. It was moving to fast. I called my brother who in MUFON and he thought of a Chinese Lantern. I dont think so as it was moving to fast. It was very bright red and the fire was pulsating like a fire would be. Not just a fire in the chinese lantern. What ever it was was sure unfire and really moving. We were really scared because we thought someone was in trouble, and also why was it suddenly appearing like that?"],"Longitude":"-83.39531","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/07/2011 10:25 UTC"}
