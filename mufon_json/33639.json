It was fairly low on the horizon and behind some trees. I looked at it and realized it was moving behind the trees at a very slow pace, slower than a plane, and descending slightly as it went. The brightness of it was really noticeable and steady in intensity. I used a 20x spotting scope but all I could see was a star-like image. the object was traveling from southeast to northwest and finally dropped below the treeline. I've seen the space station before, and this was a much larger and brighter object, moving appreciably slower. Thanks you guys."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11272011-0011","Tags":"City","City":"Warren","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-82.977429"}
