At approximately 9:30 PM MT Saturday October 17th, Mountain time (rough estimate), as I was walking in the alley behind my house just north of Mile High Stadium in Denver, I happened to look up at the sky to see three points of light, arranged roughly in an equilateral triangle formation (if viewed from an oblique angle), moving extremely rapidly across the sky, in approximately the north to south direction. The object(s) were roughly west of me. The speed seemed very high, at least compared to what I expect of a commercial airliner traveling at high altitude at cruising speed or low altitude on approach to DIA. I would estimate that a typical military fighter would have to be traveling very fast and very low to have the same apparent velocity that the three points of light had (having had experience with low military aircraft flyovers of Bronco���s games at Mile High). It is hard to estimate how long the three points were visible to me, but I would guess perhaps 3-5 seconds. The sky was extremely clear that night, with no visible clouds. In terms of size and intensity the points of light appeared very similar to stars, but without any oscillation in the apparent magnitude (i.e., they did not twinkle). The points had the brightness of a middle bright star, i.e., they were very obvious, but there were both brighter and dimmer stars visible in the sky. The lights were definitely white, not red or green or blinking white as you'd expect from commercial or general aviation aircraft. There was no point of light in the middle of the triangle. The three points seemed to be arranged in an equilateral triangle formation for the majority of the time that they were visible to me, however, as they receded into the distance to the south, the triangle formation collapsed. I cannot say for sure if the orientation of the objects was equilateral or not given the uncertainty of the object's orientation with respect to my viewing position on the ground. It is also impossible to tell if the three points were on the same object, or if they were three separate objects. The collapse of their apparent triangle orientation could have either been a single object rotating or three separate objects changing their position with respect to each other. I listened intently for any sound, expecting to hear jet engines, but there was no audible sounds at all above the ambient noise of the highway (I-25, a couple hundred yards to the east of my position). The object(s) were certainly not satellites, whose slow constant motion across the sky I am very familiar with. It is impossible for me to give an estimate of the size of the object or the distance between the points of light as there was no frame of reference available. If I assume that it was a single object, I could not discern any outline to the object as it appeared black against a black sky. Searching for more information on this, I found the 1990 Brussels video, and what I saw over Denver looked very much like that. The primary difference between my sighting and the Brussels video is that the object(s) that I saw were not moving slowly or hovering. When I saw it, it was moving very fast in a straight line until it was out of sight. I have seen other rare phenomena in the sky, including a Soviet rocket engine entering the atmosphere, appearing as a large fireball, and another large fireball that I assumed was a large meteor, but this was absolutely nothing like that. These were three discrete points of light traveling rapidly and in synchronized formation, without trails, without sound. Personally, I am an extremely skeptical individual and if I were to hear a similar report, I would normally attribute it to either a meteorological phenomenon, or to simple psychological misinterpretation of the scene, which is very common given our brain's inherent pattern seeking mechanisms that lead us to find patterns where none really exist. However, in this case, neither of those explanations is plausible to me. This is one of the strangest things I have ever seen in the night sky, and I can honestly say that I have no idea what it was."],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Three points of light flying in formation at high speed","Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-105.778557","Log Number":"US-10182009-0012","Date Submitted":"10/18/2009 02:39 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19999.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19999.html"],"Case Number":"19999","Date of the Event":"10/17/2009 09:30 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.559751,+-105.778557(19999)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19999) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":[],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Unknown"}
