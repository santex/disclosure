I parked my car, looked up and saw 3 bright orange red orbs in the sky above our street but appeared to be only slightly higher than the clouds (we have had recent rain which is subsiding and there were partial clouds in the sky). The orbs were not moving, they were perfectly still for about 30 seconds and then they slowly began moving southwest in perfect unison and in perfect equal spacing from one another. It was quiet and peaceful but we were all in awe wondering what they could be. They did notlook like planes at all with a very different movement and lighting presentation than the planes we see all the time. We couldn't stop talking about it all night. I texted my friends and 3 adult children to tell them what I witnessed. Because they disappeared as they reached a cloud, we could not be sure if they disappeared going up, or because they went behind a cloud or for some other reason."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"We (neighbors too) saw 3 bright orange/red orbs standing perfectly still then slowly moved to the left in perfect unison with perfect equal spacing as they moved; they one by one disappeared beyond the clouds.","Log Number":"US-04062013-0008","Date Submitted":"04/06/2013 01:31 UTC","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Santa Rosa","There were no other sightings in Santa Rosa on or around April 5th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.446887,+-122.705651(46626)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46626) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Case Number":"46626","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46626.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46626.html"],"Longitude":"-122.705651","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
