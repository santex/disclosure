(note these spheres were not stars or planets of any type or size as they were well defined spheres and had no wink effect as a star or planet would have viewing through the atmosphere). also made note that they were no other aircraft observed to be in the air at the time, because i made an attempt to recognize and look for any form of the typical red\\green running lights that aircraft have their wings and noted no bright white light that would be on the tail of an aircraft either. also observed no contrail, exhaust or wake near or around the spheres. at first thought the lights might of been flares set off by a military aircraft(the type of flares used when heat seeking missiles are fire at them, to try to divert the missile, plus the location to the south is grissom afb)but these flares are of a very bright white in color and last for a duration as these were orange (like a pale colored pumpkin)and then just winked out and not just fade out like a flare would. unable to note any noise or sound from any form of propulsion as i was inside my car driving. these spheres were very similar to ones that i had noted about 3 years while out star gazing with my telescope except for that episode noted that there were four spheres in a formation, that of a trapazoid again noted to the south - south west and moving to west at about 3 - 5 mph. my feelings at the time of the first sighting july 21, was exhilarating to see another ufo as i have seen many in the past. also brought back things that i had learned in a couple of night courses that i had taken at vincennes university 67 - 77 presented by j. sievers and k. tevorbough, and tried to follow the procedures that they discussed to document these type of sightings."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Latitude":"41.2381","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Warsaw","There were no other sightings in Warsaw on or around July 21st 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.2381,+-85.853047(11818)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11818) map </A>","Longitude":"-85.853047","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Warsaw","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07302008-0005","Case Number":"11818","Summary":"observed numerous groups of 3 spheres in the sky over 5 nights"}
