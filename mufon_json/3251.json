I ve never reported anything before.This is my first time seeing and reporting.I just had to tell someone and you guys were my best bet."],"trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around March 16th 2005"],"City":"Los Angeles","Country":"United States"}
