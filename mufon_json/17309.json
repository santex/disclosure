We have a sliding glass door going to the deck facing north. I am always on the look out for planes and chemtrails and whatever else may be in the sky. My daughter and I also like to look at our flowers and birds and other wildlife. So monday about 11am I see what I at first thought was a flock of birds flying south towards our house. They got closer and I realized that they werent birds; they seemed to be 5 wide, narrow diamond shapes. What really then got my attention was when they made 45 degree turns, all in tandem, with no sound whatsoever. They seemed to reflect sunlight when they were facing about southwest it seems. From that angle they appeared to be metallic without a doubt. When they \"turned\" in other directions they appeared more of a light brown, almost grey color. There were 4 diamond-shaped objects in the middle, all in a diamond shaped pattern. They remained in that formation the entire time. There was a 5th object that seemed to \"orbit\" the other 4, first one way then another. As soon as I could get my camera they faded into the sun. There was never a sound."],"Date Submitted":"06/01/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States"}
