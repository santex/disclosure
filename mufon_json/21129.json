{"Case Number":"21129","Summary":"Unknown silent circular craft shined light on us.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21129.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21129.html"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsIn the summer of 1967 or 1968, my friend Tim and I were sitting in a pickup truck watching for bears in a garbage dump on Werth Road, just outside Alpena Mi. It was 10:00 PM or so when Tim saw a moving light, kind of like a distant star, on the horizon far to the east of us. What surprised us to begin with was it reversed and went backwards then reversed again as if on a string. Tim had a spot light with a DC-10 landing light in it and he flashed it at the dot of light. After a moment, we could see that the object was coming toward us and Tim continued to shine the light at it. We got out of the pickup and got onto the roof. The object traveled to a point that appeared to be high in the sky directly above us. The object then appeared to be getting bigger and bigger and we realized it was descending. It got to a point where the spotlight was able to reach the bottom of the ���craft��� which we could now see was saucer shaped. Earlier in the evening we were outside our cabin on Beaver Lake and used the spot to light up the woods on the other side of the lake. Where we were, the lake is about ��� of a mile across, so we guessed the ���craft��� was about 3500 to 4000 feet above us. There was no noise and no downdraft. Suddenly a light emitted from the ���craft���, like a spot light but looked florescent, right down on us and only lit up the area of the truck, not the surrounding area. At that point we jumped down and into the truck and got out of there. We drove a couple miles west to a little known town of Spratt, which had a bar and Laundromat. In the parking lot of the bar was a payphone. We called the Michigan State Police and told them what happened. They told us to wait for a car to respond. We could still see the ���craft��� hovering over the dump area. A little while later a DNR vehicle showed up and asked if we were the ones who had an animal complaint. He said there wasn���t an available car in the area so he was sent but they didn���t tell him what it was about. We told him the story and pointed out the ���craft��� that was still there. He got on the radio and advised what he had and that it was still there. A short while later, the dispatcher advised him that Alpena AFB, Grayling and Travers City said nothing was on radar, as the three of us stood there watching it. He took our information and we all left. The next morning, a State Trooper knocked on our cabin door and advised us we were to go into Alpena AFB, that they wanted to talk to us. When we arrived, officers from the Voodoo Witch Fighter Squadron separately interviewed us and were both asked to draw pictures of what we saw. Several months later we received an in depth questionnaire from Wright Patterson AFB. We both filled them out and returned them and that is the last we ever heard of it."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Alpena","Date of the Event":"11/30/1966 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"45.067099","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-12252009-0015","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Alpena","There were no other sightings in Alpena on or around November 30th 1966"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/25/2009 05:16 UTC","Longitude":"-83.425543","Region":"Michigan","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.067099,+-83.425543(21129)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21129) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
