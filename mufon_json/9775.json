{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were down in Point Loma at the old NTC base at about 6:45pm February 27, 2008 looking south west when we saw 3 disc like glowing objects with a yellowish glow. They were floating in position, no noise, for about a minute. Then the one on the far right just disappeared, almost like it evaporated. Then within seconds the other two did the same thing. This was witnessed by about 10 people."],"Date Submitted":"02/27/2008 06:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9775.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9775.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-117.147855","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.721389,+-117.147855(9775)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9775) map </A>","City":"San Diego","trends":["There have been 151 other sightings in San Diego","There were 8 other sightings in San Diego on or around February 27th 2008"],"Region":"California","Latitude":"32.721389","Summary":"3 yellow floating orbs...","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02282008-0035","Object Shape":"Disc","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/27/2008 06:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"9775"}
