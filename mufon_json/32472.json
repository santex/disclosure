Nearly over head at about a 80 degree angle I saw small pinpoints of light like stars. first light went east for about two seconds then went out. Then the second light from the same starting point went west for about two seconds and went out. Then another point of light appeared went south for about two seconds and went out. Then another point of light appeared went north for about two seconds also went out. It looked like if you joined them all from their starting points that they formed a plus sign in their flight paths."],"Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/09/2011 01:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-10092011-0001","Latitude":"33.240303"}
