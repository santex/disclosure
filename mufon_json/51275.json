At first I thought it was a helicopter hovering, but the three light from this object was one above the other. and all lit. and just below the object it flow one of the L A X planes Im sure they saw it. I set out there for a while and after I smoked the whole cigarette and watch the object not move at all with the air planes flying under them this thing did not move at all. I brush it off as something the sky and went back in the house after watch this thing for over a hour. just to see if it will move but it didn't so I just went to bed.
