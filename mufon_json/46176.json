It was still very dark the sun was not yet rising. I was looking SW in the sky. I saw a stationary light just above the horizon.. At first I thought it was maybe a helicopter because it was not moving. I saw another light approach the stationary light then suddenly 4-5 lights dropped out of the stationary light straight down to the ground. The stationary light disappeared. I watch the sky for another 20 minutes but saw nothing"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46176.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46176.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.732499,+-97.31105(46176)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46176) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/13/2013 06:50 UTC","Case Number":"46176","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown"}
