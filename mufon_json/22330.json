( if it is a star) At 10:30 it's about 20 degrees off the horizon just to the right of the Big Dipper handle. When it first comes up it's east to west in line with the Big Dipper. But, as time goes on it moves in a southwesterly direction NOT WEST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE. I've written MUFON with no reply. Who can I contact that gives a crap enough to answer my e-mail? There are a thousand stars out there tonight and not one looks like this one. It flashes red, white, blue, green, yellow at a fast pace and through the telescope looks like a round black background. Does anyone have a clue what it is? It's been there every night for several weeks now."],"Region":"Indiana"}
