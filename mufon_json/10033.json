{"Tags":"City","divs":["sighting details2\\20\\08 i was recording the lunar moon between 9pm-10:15pm in north chicago il. at my girl house, on the back porch with the window open. it was very cold that night! i know they said on the news that the satalite was suppose to get shot down, but it dont suppose to reach earth until march and when it hit the atmosphere, it wasn't gone be no bigger then a foot ball! i emailed cnn,fox and cltv and told them what i recorded that night and i didn't get no response back yet! maybe they think i'm pulling their coat tails or something. i don't know, but as i was recording the lunar moon with an old camcorter,(sony hi 8. model:ccd-trv108)so you know i can't stage or fake what i recorded, all of a sudden out of nowhere, this bright light was falling real fast and disappeared.my girl thought it was a falling star and i said stars don't fall! i knew it couldn't of been the satalite either! so what was it? the next day i played my tape back and what i saw wasn't no falling star, no satalite and damn sure not no air plane!!!!!! it was this light from a far distance, but yet in our atmosphere falling super fast. as i kept rewinding my tape, around this light, looked like some smaller type lights, flashing all around it, poping on and off like shoots from a gun at night! it wasn't attached to the falling light, it was flickering from a distance around it!(mind you, it was from a far distance, recorded on an old camcorter!) i seen ships all my life and i would of thought i was crazy if i seen them by myself, but i always have somebody there to witness it with me every time! this time i got it recorded on tape and it's all real!!!!!!!! i let my dad and friends view it and they can't explain what it could be either. i can't down load it on my computer, because i don't have the proper connects to plug to my camcorter and computer. the computer old too! need an upgrade.lol! but anyways, i just been sitting on my tape, trying to get some feed back and hopefully paid for my discovery, caught on camara!!!!! i'm sorry i can't send a copy, but i still got it thow! contact me or leave a email and let me know what should i do from here. thank you, w. randy pitts"],"Log Number":"US-03242008-0011","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Shape":"Flash, Oval, Star-like, Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Windy, Medium","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.363633,+-87.844794(10033)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10033) map </A>","City":"Waukegan","Summary":"Light falling real fast, with other lights bursting around it.","Region":"Illinois","Date of the Event":"02/20/2008 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/20/2008 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Waukegan","There were no other sightings in Waukegan on or around February 20th 2008"],"Object Features":"Other","Longitude":"-87.844794","Case Number":"10033","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10033.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10033.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10033.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"42.363633"}
