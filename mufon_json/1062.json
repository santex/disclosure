Clear sky. I was outside, in front of my house facing East and justhappened to look up about 45 degrees to see 2 steady pale yellow-white lightsflying East to West at an extremely fast rate. It passed about directly overheadand proceeded to fly off to the horizon in the West, possibly jinking a bit tothe North at about 45 degrees above the Western horizon. This all took under 10seconds. More like 5. The two lights moved parallel to each other and may havebeen two lights on either side of a dark central structure. There was no soundand the object(s) must either have been huge, or low level, as several normalaircraft were in the air at the same time and their running lights appeared muchsmaller than these lights. The lights did not change in intensity, it simplykept going West until I could no longer see it. I thought at first it may havebeen MIR or the new Space station or shuttle, but dont these objects travelWest to East? There were no trails of any sort."],"Log Number":"","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Pair of lights moving rapidly east to west.","trends":["There have been 53 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around February 18th 2001"],"Date of the Event":"02/18/2001 09:05 UTC"}
