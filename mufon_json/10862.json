What we saw was no comet it had not trace of fire behind it and did not fade out it just kept flying across the entire sky until it faded away. The night was clear and you could see all the stars this object was round like a ball and faded off white. The ufo was so high in the sky it looked like it was flying near the stars but the circle was clear enough to see. I wish I could have recorded this because we knew this was not a plane, comet or anything normal it was traveling north west it looked maybe like it was over Ohio going west. This is not a false sighting! I believe we are not alone and the government is keeping this education form us. I sent this info to the ufo hunters on the history channel. I uploaded an image of what it looked like."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/27/2008 10:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Jonesborough","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Jonesborough","There were no other sightings in Jonesborough on or around April 27th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.294272,+-82.473479(10862)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10862) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/27/2008 10:05 UTC","Latitude":"36.294272","Region":"Tennessee","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Faded Circle No Lights it was not bright","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
