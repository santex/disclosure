I thought, if they need help down there from a tsunami I can go there now and never come back. Fortunately, there was no tsunami, but there was this video from SkyNews out of Britian. The funny thing is, is that there are other videos posted on youtube from the same news company, but this part was edited out. Why would it be on their site and all of the other sources have it edited out? It was a live broadcast. It is certainly not a bird or a plane."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around September 5th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"42318","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.913972,+-77.047854(42318)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42318) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Country":"United States","Summary":"Searching for video on quake and noticed objects","Log Number":"MX-09052012-0014","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.913972","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42318.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42318.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
