Right before we hit Joppa Town, there was an object about 100 feet up to the left of the car that I thought was an airplane. Then, I noticed it wasn't moving and it was blinking two large flood lights in the front and on the sides. They were flashing on and off slowley. There were numerous small blinking red lights that were blinking around the perimeter, they were blinking at a much faster rate. It hovered there, and we were actually driving, we never saw it leave, it just got out of our view. It made me just feel very confused. I really thought it was a plane, so I was looking at it waiting for it to move. My husband was seeing this also. He is the one who pointed out to me it was not a plane. We live very close to Aberdeen Proving Grounds. I'm more inclined to think it was something from the military."],"Weather Factors":"Windy","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Joppatowne","There were no other sightings in Joppatowne on or around January 17th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"H shaped.
