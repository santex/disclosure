Sattelites go east west, these move north south, and change direction, dip into lower altitude and get brighter, then climb and fade out in brightness. Some move slow some very fast, much faster and definatley higher than comercial or military aircraft. I work security for Fallon NAS at Boeing on the grave shift, but also have seen them at home at night if there is no full moon or excess light. I know that there are no aircraft that fly that high that regularly and have no running lights, or flashers. They seem to almost wobble side to side as they move at times."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
