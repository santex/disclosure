{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile driving down I35 last night, right before the rest area before exit 178, we were noticing a truck with a large trailer swerving a great deal. Immediately, to my left, I watched as a very large orb, emitting an incredibly bright white light appeared to land in an area surrounding a private subdivision on the east side of 35. As it landed, it seemed to become almost like plasma...or liquid light. We drove around looking for some sort of either a crash or other witnesses. We found neither."],"Latitude":"29.61161","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Schertz","There were no other sightings in Schertz on or around April 9th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.61161,+-98.26437(37351)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37351) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-04102012-0015","Summary":"Driving down 35 towards exit 178 heading south light land","Case Number":"37351","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37351.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37351.html"],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball","Longitude":"-98.26437","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"04/09/2012 11:20 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/10/2012 05:42 UTC","City":"Schertz","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
