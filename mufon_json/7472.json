{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking a nightly walk throughout the town of Moscow, ID listening to music on my mp3 player and as I was coming up the street to my apartment I looked up to the east (bearing of 50 degrees, approx 35 degrees elevation) and saw what I thought at first to be a bright star, however there were no stars (or planets) that were that bright in that sector of the sky. The light then got brighter for a moment and then started moving in a U type curve higher into the sky and began to get dimmer. Shortly thereafter I lost track of the object. Shortly thereafter I sprinted to my apartment to grab my camera, but by the time I got back outside I could not find the object again after about 30 minutes of searching the sky. The sky is also hazy in this area at this time of year due to dust which did not help in tracking the object."],"Log Number":"US-07182007-0001","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-117.000165","Summary":"Bright yellow moving light in the night sky","Date of the Event":"07/17/2007 10:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"46.732388","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.732388,+-117.000165(7472)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7472) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7472.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7472.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Region":"Idaho","Date Submitted":"07/17/2007 10:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Moscow","There were no other sightings in Moscow on or around July 17th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Case Number":"7472","City":"Moscow","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown"}
