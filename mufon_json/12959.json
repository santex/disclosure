{"Summary":"Many white tiny, star like, blinking objects traveling at high rates of speed in a very confined area of the sky.","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsit was around 9 pm on thurs sept 11, 2008 in warrington which is located in bucks county, pa. i was sitting on my recliner watching tv when i started hearing this loud rumbling noise. i figured it was a plane and didn't think much of it. after i heard the noise for several minutes i started to get a little concerned and got up to see what it was. at that same moment my wife came dowstairs and asked me if i heard the noise. after we both agreed on hearing it, we went outside on the front porch to see what it could be. we looked up in the sky and both were immediately surprised to see lots of white tiny blinking star like objects in a very confined area of the sky. my first immediate thought was that maybe we were getting attacked since it was 9\\11. i knew it was definitely something that i had never seen before. the blinking lights were traveling at a high rate of speed almost like falling stars which made me think these were no airplanes. there was definitely too many lights in the same area to be airplanes. if i had to put a number on the objects that i saw, i would have to say around 10-20. we both stood there puzzeled for 5 minutes watching these lights, when to make things worse my wife looked over on the porch and pointed out a black cat about 5 feet away just sitting there staring at us. freaked out by this point, we both ran back in the house. after being inside the house and trying to figure out what it could be, i decided to call the willow grove navy base which is located not far from our home. a woman answered the phone and told us that they were testing planes in the area. i hung up the phone unconvinced and wondered several things. 1. why would the air base conduct such a test on sept.11 when they know that people's anxieties are already high to begin with? 2. i have lived at this location for almost 10 years and have never experienced anything like this, so was this the first time they were ever conducting this test? 3. i am no pilot by any means, but how could atleast 10-20 airplanes be confined in such a small area of the sky at the same time, especially at night, and traveling at such fast speed and be able to avoid crashing? a few minutes after hanging up the phone we went back outside. the loud rumbling noise was gone and the sky was completely empty. i can not say for sure what it was that i saw, but i can say it was definitely something that i had never witnessed before in my life."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.954125,+-75.155329(12959)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12959) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/11/2008 09:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/11/2008 09:00 UTC","Case Number":"12959","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.954125","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12959.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12959.html"],"Log Number":"US-10082008-0013","Longitude":"-75.155329","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There was one other sighting in Philadelphia on or around September 11th 2008"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Philadelphia","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
