I thought it might be a plane but could not see red and green blinking lights its was just a steady bright white star moving faster than a plane. There was no clouds just a nice breeze. I would say it was about 1000 miles away from me, it was far enough but close enough to see that it was not a plane. I looked at my watch and recorded the time 9:13pm and it lasted till 9:15PM until the bright object dissapered behind the tree line. I happened to notice that there were two other planes above me that were heading straight for the object they dissapered as well behind the tree line those had blinking red and green lights I don't know if they were following it but it sure looked like it.
