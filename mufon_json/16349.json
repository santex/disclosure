Time was 20:55 hours. They moved quickly, making no noise, heading to the east sky of route 16 heading south. Total time lapse 22 seconds. I was driving home from Springville after just going grocery shopping at Wal-mart. I was driving on Route 16 heading south to Machias when I saw 6 white lights in the western sky. They were at first formulated in a parallelogram shape pattern but then started to make a straight line. These lights continued over my vehicle, making no noise, into the eastern sky. I continued to watch until they disappeared. The time I noted was 20:55 (8:55pm) on my wristwatch then when they disappeared it was 20:55:22 (8:55:22pm). I could account for no sound because I had my window rolled down and it was a clear night as well."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Buffalo","Region":"New York","Log Number":"US-03312009-0018","Case Number":"16349","Date of the Event":"03/17/2009 08:55 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-78.874869","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/17/2009 08:55 UTC","trends":["There have been 56 other sightings in Buffalo","There were no other sightings in Buffalo on or around March 17th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.888527","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16349.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16349.html"]}
