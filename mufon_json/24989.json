Last night the sky was so clear and beautiful. I noticed one of the stars move then move back. I thought it was a spasm in my eye. I focused on this star. It did this quick movement three times. From where it was stationary it went west then back to its original spot. The distance it moved was very short. Afterward it moved across the sky a great distance. From where I originally saw it and headed east. It kind of wobbled in its flight path it was weird hard to describe. Moved past another dark object in the sky, that had no illumination and continued on. It kind of looked like an eclipse. Then it stopped for a few seconds, and then faded away like a shiny object sinking in murky water. I assumed it could have been a satellite. But I never heard of a satellite change direction so quickly and then disappear. Possible asteroid? Again not sure. The change in direction is the only thing making me consider intelligent guided craft. Of course when I see something like this I don���t have a camera, binoculars, or my telescope handy. I did grab my binoculars afterwards and watched the sky for a further 20 minutes. But only one shooting star from a south to north direction was observed."],"Case Number":"24989","Longitude":"-75.175491","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.009319,+-75.175491(24989)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24989) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
