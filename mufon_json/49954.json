Right before the 21:52 pass, there was a red glowing \"thing\" at about 60 degrees going from the NE to the NW (the opposite direction of the ISS). It went straight across, then up, the lights went out and it continued NW - it was shaped like a stealth fighter - like an odd trangle. As far as we know, the Air National Guard at Toledo Express doesn't have any stealths. Later at about 22:45 - 22:50 another one passed overhead, followed by 4 more - all of those were at approx 90 degrees, directly overhead. None of them made a sound. When the second set came over, I got the camera and grabbed some video, but it's not really helpful, just looks like a red circle going across the sky."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08172013-0040"}
