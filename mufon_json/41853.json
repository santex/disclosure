Directly above the houses","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside on porch with 2 other people, the blue slightly glowing yet transparent orb came across the sky at about a 45 degree angle above the horizon from east to west. We were in amazement to see such a sight and watched it glide behind the neighbor house who lives in front of ours, across the street, we didnt get up to see where it was going( still in amazement). The object didnt stray off course or project anything, it was at a steady speed, it wasnt slow or super fast. The orb just glided along by itself. my daughters daughter was scared and started to cry and just a minute before this she came out of the house to tell us the internet wasnt working. my daughter noticed it first and pointed the orb out, and i just enjoyed the view."],"Date Submitted":"08/19/2012 12:48 UTC"}
