It aired today at 11pm on Monday February 20 2012 on direct TV channel 236 in New Mexico. During the episode the camera goes to the LA skyline when a very fast moving object could be seen flying right above the skyline very bright and very fast. It looked like if was changing speeds as it changed in length as it flew across. This was captured on video and I believe is worth investigating! I am a police officer in Albuquerque NM and this object is the most interesting thing I have ever seen and since it is a reality TV show I don't see why it would be faked and really can't see what else it could be so close to the skyline and going so fast!"],"City":"Los Angeles","Summary":"Ufo captured on video going across city skyline","Case Number":"35960","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35960.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35960.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.053514,+-118.235535(35960)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35960) map </A>"}
