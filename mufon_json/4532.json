What caught my attention was the fact that there were no blinking lights on the craft. As I continued driving I noticed it was getting closer. I lost track of it for a couple of minutes, because of some buildings and trees I was driving by. Once I located the object again, I realized it it was taking a strange shape. At one point I thought it was a blimp because of a low-humming sound it was expelling. As I neared my destination, I can make-out a triangular shape, with about 4-6 white lights on each side,and a red light in the center. It continued its path, until it eventually disappeared into the sky."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"03/08/2006 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Santa Fe Springs","There were no other sightings in Santa Fe Springs on or around March 8th 2006"],"Summary":"Triangular- shaped, white lights on each side, with a Red light in the center","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Santa Fe Springs","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.947236,+-118.085345(4532)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4532) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
