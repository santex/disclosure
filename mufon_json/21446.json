(4 of us saw it, 2 at first). i watched them for maybe 5-7 minutes. thanks and good luck with your show, it's starting to strike home with me now. it's funny, it actually really didn't surprise me after i began to think about it. people have been seeing ufo's for a long time. i just never thought it would be this blatant and this amazing right here in pico rivera with that much light pollution. thanks again for your time. i can give a word for word description of what happened at any time. the events will never go away in my mind, i hope someone out there shot some video. i sent this to ufo hunters and just found your website. the most amazing thing about this was that they were able to go from the intensity of a dim star to a light that was 10 times brighter than any helicopter or plane in the sky and they all left in the same direction. incredible. 1. i was standing on my friends front porch smoking a cigarette. 2. i first noticed what looked like 3 planes coming towards us from the west, the intensity of light is what made me first notice it. 3. i didn't know what it was, i asked my friend and he said it could be air traffic from lax, but when they stopped in the sky and and slightly reconfigured themselves to form a perfect triangle is when i became suspect. 4. i think i've covered this. 5. i was shaking, i couldn't control my thoughts. i called my friend who has a similar mindset when it comes to these things and all he could say was \"cms\\tg\\pd]\". 6. the 3 objects disappeared in the same direction, with it's light decreasing as it moved south across the sky and out of view. the last one got really bright for a period then went in the same direction as the other two."],"Date Submitted":"01/11/2010 11:32 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/10/2010 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.990809,+-118.094465(21446)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21446) map </A>","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Pico Rivera","There were no other sightings in Pico Rivera on or around January 10th 2010"],"City":"Pico Rivera","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"21446","Log Number":"US-01112010-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21446.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21446.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
