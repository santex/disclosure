My husband and I have been watching, going in and out of the house. Throughout the evening we have been seeing the airplanes from far and close. The meteors, which were shooting in all different directions: Some were very high and dim, some were close and you could see the trail just after them! One would shoot off the southeast and about 5 minutes later one would shoot off straight to the north. About 1:15 am or so we started back outside for a bit. As I was preparing my chair to sit down (we had been watching the northeast sky, way from the city lights) I was facing south and looked to the east and I see an Orange Glow, keep in mind we had been watching the meteor shower all evening! I told my hubby to take a look; I grabbed my phone and started recording it! I recorded the Orange Glow for about 25 seconds as it crossed the sky. It had to be flying just above the Hwy 175 heading northwest towards Dallas. Just as I turned off the camera on my phone, I noticed another Orange Glow just behind it! I started recording again. Just behind that Orange Glow, this time there were two more flying side by side, with yet, another behind that one. Totaling 5 altogether! While I was taking video, my hubby was shooting pictures from the iphone 3GS. The same type device I was recording the video. After the event, we were discussing our opinions. There was not a sound, no trail behind them, and they were flying perfectly together. I would assume around the same speed as a slow plane. Almost like they were following something up the highway! I have the pictures and the video! On the video, the night was so dark you cannot even see the houses or trees in the frame. Nor can you see the color! However, in the pictures my husband took you can see the color! I figure if they had been meteors they would not have flown in such a formation, there would have been a trail behind them, and I don���t think they would have been flying so slowly! My husband says, ���We see and hear the planes and helicopters fly by all the time. No sound, no blinking lights, just orange lights floating through the sky. ���"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","City":"Seagoville","Region":"Texas","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Seagoville","There was one other sighting in Seagoville on or around August 12th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41758.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41758.html"],"Log Number":"US-08152012-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-96.539625","Date of the Event":"08/12/2012 01:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:45","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.636303,+-96.539625(41758)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41758) map </A>","Summary":"Watching a meteor shower, saw 5 orange glowing objects flying toward the city","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"41758","Date Submitted":"08/15/2012 12:29 UTC"}
