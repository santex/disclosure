Late in the afternoon, I was alone in the back yard next to the pool. I heard a large plane flying by. I looked up. I noticed it was a military plane. No big deal cause Mirimar air base is close by. Until I notices a small silver ball moving behind the air plane. I watched it follow the plane. My first thought was, oh look, the plane is towing something. then I noticed it was moving slightly in another direction. I ran to call my wife just 10 feet from me. Took maybe 6 seconds, by the time i looked back up the sphere was gone. Dont know what it was..."]}
