Md. I look up at the stars. I saw one making squares .I said \"look Bud what is that? It dident make a sound just made squares all over the evening sky.Then shot away. We never told any one. Also about three years ago I saw an alien in my back yard. It was summer IIwas in bed about midnight looked out the open window by my bed. Something was moving,I put on my glasses to see what it was. It was a very small person about 4 feet tall. He was creeping across the yard I knew He didn't want to be seen.My yard is very bright there. He was wearing some kind of suit one peace with hood as I saw no ears. I was fasanated. He creeped so slowly looking all around.He sure didn't want to be seen. I thought he was cute. I realy wanted to speak to him but thought better of it. He was not human. I searched the web to see if I could find one who looked like him. and I did but its not much help as he looked like the one in the alien autopsuy Sure wish I could see him again. I layed back down when I looked again he was gone.This took place at my home in Kanab Ut. In 2005"]}
