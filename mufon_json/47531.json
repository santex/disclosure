I do not know how long it had been there since the trees had been in the way until I got closer to the barn.I stopped to watch it and called out to my friend who was helping me. We looked at it for a couple of minutes and then it disappeared as if it had been turned off.It was nearly as big as the moon.I have never seen anything like it. I am a stargazer and have seen odd things before, but nothing like that. I have no explanation for it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.417074,+-88.245384(47531)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47531) map </A>","Case Number":"47531"}
