They apeared to have a hazy mist around them.5 minutes later from the south a very large v shape of these lights 20 or 30 apeared going north quickly. As I watched some of the lights moved so it was aw shape. I observed this for about 3 seconds.I live where there are a lot of geese always going by and I am certain these werent geese because the rate of speed this moved at would indicate the geese were low to the ground and so easy to see wings, knecks etc.There was no such things!These things werent solid objects at all and were not aircraft!!!I havent told this to anyone but my husband who thinks Im just crazy."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/23/2010 06:05 UTC","trends":[],"Object Shape":"Oval","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"beam of light apears in a clear dawn sky, turned and 6 or 7 balls of light fall out of it, rolling to the north and form a v shape. etc.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.019002,+-98.477516(35014)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35014) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
