It was a cloudless, windless, moonless night. I observed a bright white circular light travelling southwest to northeast from horizon to horizon in a straight line. I first thought the object was an aircraft, but the object appeared larger and brighter than Saturn and had no navigation lights. It was moving several times faster than commercial jets and was also faster and much brighter than any satellite that has been seen from the same location. The object went horizon to horizon in less than 30 seconds. There was no noise heard. The object remained bright white for a few seconds after passing overhead, then changed color from a bright white to a dull orange. I continued to observe until I could no longer see it."],"Region":"California","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.683317,+-121.651291(26373)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26373) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-11052010-0001","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Salinas","There were no other sightings in Salinas on or around November 4th 2010"],"Summary":"Large object went horizon-horizon in 30 secs extremely bright & changed color","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"36.683317","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26373.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26373.html"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"26373","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
