{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThere have been many sightings by myself, friends, and family around and above my house for the last three years. Some objects appear as stars then jet off at incredible speed and others are reddish orbs. A few times they just swarm overhead with my fiance and I observing. I had a sighting as a child as well, so I don't know, could be coincidence. June 15, 2010 around 9pm, outside my house, was a particularly strange sighting I had with my sister and fiance. We were watching a few ufo glide around a while and then one came up to us and blared us with light for a few seconds and sped off in a blink of an eye. This left me in tears, it scared me. I saw a daytime ufo two days later over my house, bright white orb. Don't know what to make of it all."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 03:22 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.787421,+-119.409882(24283)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24283) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07062010-0034","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"06/14/2010 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-119.409882","trends":[],"Case Number":"24283","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24283.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24283.html"],"Latitude":"36.787421","Summary":"Multiple orbs, some at fast speeds, one approached and flashed a light at us.","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
