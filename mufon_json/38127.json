He witnessed a pillow shaped object that at first he said he thought was a blimp or balloon. When he finally focused on it he realized it was pillow shaped. He said there was a con-trail in the sky also that i believe he said partly obscured the object at times and he was not sure if it had left the trial. He said he was not under the influence of any drugs or alcahol. He said it was real big, bigger than a plane, moving real fast, flying lower than any plane would. It was flying over homes in our city nieghborhood. He wanted to get his phone out to take a picture but said he did not have time. I see no reason to doubt his claim. At this point he only says it was an unidentified flying obect, not necessarly extraterestrial."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38127.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38127.html"],"Summary":"pillow like object moving very fast in one direction"}
