As I walk down the street going towards my house, I see a ghostly hazy image of a smog that looks like a real old looking huge DC-3 Aircraft from the 1950s. I see this airplane as it just sit there parked on top of the roof as it hovers over my 3 flat apartment house. Seeing this thing as it read ���Ozark Airlines��� as plain as day. As soon as I turn my head for a split second, poof! It is long gone! This has happened right after my good friend who recently had passed away, because he used to fly home on family visits on Ozark Airlines from O'Hare Airport to his hometown in Quincy IL. One evening last week my brother had met me up at the 7-11 store on the corner, and he had seen the same thing I did. And he recalls that he too at one time he had flown on Ozark Airline when he was drafted into the Army this was back in 1969. Why Am I seeing this Thing for? Is he coming back to haunt me? Or Maybe I just realy and truly missed him and that his way of saying that I am here?..."],"Log Number":"US-10232009-0007","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.641925","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"A Ghostly Airplane ?
