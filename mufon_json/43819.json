She knew I was into that sort of thing,6\" telescope in the yard. It was coming in through Draco straight toward us. at first there was no detectable motion, but tnen I noticed the distance between stars were slowly changing. As it got closer, it came in fast and stoped and formed a triangle with 2 others. It stayed there for 2 minutes then zoomed over to the right part of the angle and stayed there for 2 minutes then went back up and formed the angle again. After 2 munites it shot straight up and stoped next to another that was already there. The one already there went south, all the was across the sky so fast my eyes could barley fix on it. The one that came in from deep space...after 3 seconds it's light faded slowly, and it was gone. Watching this changed my life. I spent the rest of my life developing a theory that exsplains how their propulsion works...a displacement theory. My second book will tell it all."],"Log Number":"US-11102012-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"about 20 minutes","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Lawrenceburg TN.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43819.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43819.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lawrenceburg TN.","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-81.159704","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.844261","Date of the Event":"04/16/1971 08:20 UTC","Region":"South Carolina","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
