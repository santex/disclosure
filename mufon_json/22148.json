The coolest machine I ever saw about 20 ft in diameter 4 ft in the center,a pulsein hummin sound like magnetic very shiny like silver with a ring of light around the outer,underneith it moved to line it self up for a lighting takeoff to the stars,gone in less than 3 sec,the most incredable was the speed! It's awsome to watch these shows and people don't realy know if it's real,well I came up with the conclusion that it's not from earth,I would have to guess it's human but many generations ahead of us from somewhere else and were not ready for that tec yet. And yes I was scared stiff,what the hell ya gonna do when ur looking at what everyone talks about and don't know what it's there for? Luckly enuf it just left and now all I can do is tell the awsome story.yes they r there!!"],"Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.323114,+-85.594634(22148)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22148) map </A>","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"44.323114","Longitude":"-85.594634","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
