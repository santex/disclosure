At first glance I thought it was a helicopter or an airplane. But when I looked out the window a few minutes later it was stil there. I foucused on the lights for a few minutes trying to see if it was a helicopter. I couldnt tell so i got my telescope and tried viewing it. I noticed it looked like it was spinning in one spot so I grabbed my camera and went outside to take a picture. The light did look like an object but was not circle. But since it was spinning it looked like a circle. When I snapped the picture a bunch of lights formed around it as if it was more than one object leaving a trail of lights all over. so i believe this was a ufo sighting"],"Longitude":"-95.858823","Summary":"Seen outside in the sky","Date Submitted":"01/04/2012 10:23 UTC","Latitude":"41.270624","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Council Bluffs","There were 2 other sightings in Council Bluffs on or around January 3rd 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34609.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34609_submitter_file1__DSCN1572.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34609_submitter_file2__DSCN1565.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34609_submitter_file3__DSCN1566.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34609.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Case Number":"34609","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Iowa","City":"Council Bluffs"}
