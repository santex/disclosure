The light was so bright and consuming that it was hard to tell exactly what shape it was, but if pressed I would have to say cylindrical. It flew right over me. If you hold your hand out at arm's length and look at the size of your thumb, that's how big it looked, and how high. It didn't make a sound. It continued on toward the NE and disappeared. The most amazing thing I've ever seen."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/15/2007 06:44 UTC","Region":"Oklahoma","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date of the Event":"02/15/2007 06:44 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"9553","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Duncan","There were no other sightings in Duncan on or around February 15th 2007"],"Summary":"A large golden glowing cylinder shaped object approached from the SW and flew NE silently over my head.","Longitude":"-97.957813","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Duncan"}
