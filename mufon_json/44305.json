My coworkers and myself noticed a cirle of hawks above our heads. We were looking at them, the air was still; no noise whatsoever. The object entered our view roughly a mile in elevation. It sharply changed vector and took off toward the sky at approx. 3500-4000 miles-per-hour. It was boomerang shaped with sharp edges and had a blur surrounding it; as if it was disturbing the air around it. Estimated 600-700 feet across and travelling at impossible speeds. I drew a picture of it."],"Tags":"City"}
