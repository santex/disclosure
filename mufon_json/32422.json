I knew it was a ufo, considering i have past military secret clearance. It was tree elevation above a hill at my job about the size of at least 5 747s end to end with no sound. It was extremely slow moving and did a U turn right in front of me. Right after that all the animals of the woods headed to the top of the hill, it just left oddly enough. The second sighting was on 10-6-2011 when i was at home smoking outside still thinking about the first sighting, i flashed my high intensity flashlight at an object that looked like an aircraft with a banner to catch its attention, as soon as i flashed it the 'banner' disappeared and a few moments later the aircraft in front disappeared in a clear sky."],"Disposition":"Hoax","Date of the Event":"10/04/2011 08:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"multiple kansas city ufo sightings","Date Submitted":"10/07/2011 06:32 UTC","Latitude":"37.969783","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10072011-0011","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.969783,+-91.829973(32422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32422) map </A>"}
