At first I passed it off as a plane but it would hover for a long time. One time it was there about 1am, and after hovering in the sky it fly over the home and I then thought it must be a big plane. Then thought there are no aircrafts allowed to fly at 1 in the morning. I have been getting up every morning to see if it is there and it is. Very strange. This has been going on for about two weeks."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25894.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25894.html"],"Tags":"City","trends":[],"Summary":"there has been a bright light shining for a few hours every single night between 4-5:30am.
