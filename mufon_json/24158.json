Saw a yellowish light in the sky, thought it was fireworks at first, but it kept moving slowly across the sky and passed just on the south of us. It was fairly low in the sky. Got out of the car for a better view and it kept moving with out the light diminishing.Two others soon followed heading west. We watched until they disappeared. There was no sound noted from the objects and no positioning lights. We decided to head West out of town to see if we could sight them again. About one mile out of town on a dark road noticed what appeared to be a bright star low in the sky. We pulled over and observed it to see if would move. It stood still then it shifted to one side and then back again before heading to the South. Then it just disappeared from sight."],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 01:47 UTC","City":"Concordia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24158.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24158.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:40 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Watching fireworks saw yellowish light in sky heading west followed by two others on same course.","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Case Number":"24158","Latitude":"39.570835","Region":"Kansas","Longitude":"-97.66254"}
