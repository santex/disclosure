{"Case Number":"40274","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Details@ 9:55 pm cdt my family and I were returning home from a fireworks show. As we turned on the street we noticed a bright red light pulsating in the sky. We quickly pulled into the drive and got out of our car to watch the craft go over head. It was a bright red orb that glowed making it look somewhat fuzzy. The craft flew by not making a sound going from south to north. We watched it for a min or two and it was gone. I then noticed a second light coming from the south again. It was the same type of craft on the same flight path. We tried to film the second with an iPhone. It was a poor quality video, but we do have it."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 08:55 UTC","Longitude":"-98.478876","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.014082,+-98.478876(40274)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40274) map </A>","Latitude":"39.014082","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 09:55 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40274.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40274.html"],"Region":"Kansas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"2 glowing red orbs spotted in overland park is July 4","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07052012-0098"}
