In my small town of Paris Tennessee. These objects were seen by untold numbers of people in my town. It last for three days some in the news media. Were saying these were metors. They were not metors by no chances. This very bright amber objecting would fly at great speed. Then stop in midflight and stay in one spot for more then ten mins or more. Then othr bright amber objectings were all doing the same manuver. Going from spot to spot in the heavens. It just did not making any logical sense. This has always be a Great Mystery to me. It was not just a few amber like objects do this manuver. I could not count th numbers of objects. Going from one spot and stoping and another objecting a great speed doing the same thing. Stoping at great speeds like it was lineing up. This story ran in our local newspaper. No one has every said what these objects were."],"Summary":"In June the Eleventh i saw many UFOS","Object Features":"Other","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-88.812877","Log Number":"US-06242008-0001","Tags":"City","Case Number":"11286","Weather Factors":"None"}
