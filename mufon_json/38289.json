There was red glowing fireballs, they ejected some red light streams into the clouds and then black triangle objects changed their form and transform into some boomerang shaped objects with lights. One of black objects was above me (~100 meters), he floating very slowly, rotating and blinking , he didn't make any sounds. Then I saw rest of objects. I observed this event about 2-3 hours and they seemed they were like living creatures not just machines(but this is just mine opinion) I was in my yard when this happened. I just looked up and saw some red fireball and then this fireball started to move, after that i saw some black triangles, they moving slowly. One green fireball appear and gone in a few seconds later, same happened with blue fireball, and there were some white lights they just blinking and moving around black objects but not very long time."],"Region":"Zakarpats'ka","Sighting Duration":"02:30:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/20/2012 05:32 UTC","Country":"Ukraine","Date of the Event":"05/21/2012 06:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Unknown","Latitude":"48.181389","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.181389,+23.297778(38289)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38289) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Khust","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Fireball, Sphere, Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"big triangle rotating object and WHITE,RED, BLUE, GREEN LIGHTS","Case Number":"38289"}
