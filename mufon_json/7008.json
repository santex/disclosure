This has been my 5 or 6 posting using this website. I am tired of wasting my time posting and not getting any response but I wanted to share this latest video. If anyone has a comment on the video, please email me at HSIBILLY@hotmail.com. Please ask permission to use this video anywhere else. Thanks I don���t have the software to cut off the last 2 min of the video, sorry. The first 3 min. are interesting. This orb was seen on Sunday, almost directly above the house. The camera would have been pointed north. The brown object on the top of the video is my rain gutter. The wind was blowing a good 10-15 miles an hour to the east. Sorry if my video is shaky, but its very hard to find these things in a 3��� viewfinder. What���s interesting about this object is that is moves towards the house, parallel to the house, and then back towards the direction it came from. You can see in some parts of the video the objects speed increases and decreases suddenly. I have been seeing these objects since March 2007. I have taken many pictures and videos. Tips to watch these things; use polarized sun glasses to see them better in the day. They someone use the sun to hide, so watching them from under your patio helps. They know when you���re watching because they are watching you. Have faith and you will see them. Sounds a little nutty but every time I think I am done seeing them, they get a little closer.
