Suddenly, we saw a brilliant flash of beautiful blue to blue-green light, illuminate the entire sky for an instant. After about 5 seconds, there was a second flash of this same colored light. No sound, no thunder, no lightning. All the clouds lit up. There was nothing else to be seen. I can't emphasize enough how beautiful this light was. I noticed that a similar event was recorded in Auburn Hills on the NUFORC website on Dec. 24, 2008."],"Object Shape":"Flash","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"16034","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16034.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16034.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/27/2008 12:00 UTC","City":"Canton","Log Number":"US-03152009-0013","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"2 huge flashes of brilliant blue light illuminates the sky, Canton, Michigan.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.309764","Longitude":"-83.477926"}
