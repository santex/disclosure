It was so bright. It couldn't have been a star because the sun was still out and I couldn't even see Venus. The object would dim every 30 seconds (estimated). It would go in and out of brightness. A commercial plan flew right by it but the object would loss its brightness as the plan flew by. When the plan was out of few the object would re-illuminate. There is no way anyone could have missed this. The brightness was just to much to be unnoticed. It moved slower than any craft that I have seen in my life. My whole family was there to see this thing."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38335.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38335.html"],"Latitude":"30.306912","Case Number":"38335","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Austin"}
