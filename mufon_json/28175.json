But this time something very unexpected happened i noticed one light popping up slowly moving to the west, and behind that popped up another one. They had a Length of distance at between... 300 to 350 meters, and were moving at the same pace. randomly the back one would slow down or stop frequently. and then the front one would stop so the back one could catch up. If anyone has seen the same as me... please email me, cause this sighting leaved me very freaked out and confused. ( i tried to film it, but as i pressed the record button it said no memory unit, left it on my desk >_< )"],"City":"Leiderdorp","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"52.160183","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28175.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28175.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"4.533166","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/07/2011 07:40 UTC","Summary":"two lights moving together Near my house","Source":"MUFON"}
