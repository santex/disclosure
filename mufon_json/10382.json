I immediately went outside and watched for approximately seven minutes as the craft slowly made its way over my house. At times, it was moving erratically (side to side) which told me I was not seeing an airplane. Also, it emitted a strange, high pitched sound. It's difficult to explain what it sounded like but it was unlike the sound of any aircraft I've heard flying overhead. While the craft was over me (approximately 200-300 feet in the air), I noticed that it had a white light on each point of the triangle, a red light in the center and a red light in the rear. As it slowly moved away, it seemed to change shape from a triangle to a diamond (or a kite shape) with a white light on each point."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
