That is when I began observing these honey come shaped little white spots. I thought they were bugs at first, but they were as far out as the planets. I capture one almost every time I take a picture at night. I would like for you to investigate this and tell us what we are capturing on camera. This is very strange, also I have pictures of somethings like worm holes with circles of light pulsating another light into it."],"Latitude":"38.057298","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Fayetteville","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"11996","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11996.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11996.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/08/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Fayetteville","There were no other sightings in Fayetteville on or around August 8th 2008"],"Date of the Event":"08/08/2008 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-81.100041"}
