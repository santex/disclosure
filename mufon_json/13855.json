I witnessed a triangular wedged shape craft hovering about a residential treeline. The tailend had an orange glow like a light stick you'd find in a sporting goods store. After watching it for around 20 minutes it started to pick up speed and ultimately flew out of site. I saw it again two mornings later around the same time.
