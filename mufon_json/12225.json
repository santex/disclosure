{"Latitude":"39.896342","Summary":"Multiple craft with lights hovering over Dayton International Airport","divs":["sighting detailsi was going to bed just before 12:00 a.m. on monday, 25 august 2008 when i noticed blue and red lights over the dayton international airport out my bedroom window. i assumed a plane and continued to make my bed and get undressed. when i had done this, taking about 1 minute, i noticed the lights again in the same spot out my window. a plane would have moved out of sight by this time so i was a little intrigued. i grabbed my binoculars (bushnell 7-12x30 field at 7x 300ft.\\1000yds.) and took a look. i have painted a picture with microsoft��� paint��� of what i saw through the window with the binoculars. i saw a craft situated just east of the airport that had blue, red, and white-yellowish lights at a stationary spot in the sky. not being a trained observer, i can roughly guess it was at an altitude of around 1000 ft. i would estimate it's size as roughly 3\\4 the length of a boeing 747. i can only make this estimate based on decades of seeing planes come and go at this airfield. i watched a couple of minutes through the binoculars and then got right up to my window and looked around the sky with the binoculars to see if i could spot anything else. i saw an apparently similar craft above the first one by maybe 100-200 ft. between the airport and the first craft. after a couple of seconds this second craft rose what appeared to be straight up and out of sight. it was now about 12:10 a.m. i immediately went to my mother's bedroom and opened the door to see if she was still awake. she was not, so i decided to go outside the house alone. standing in my front yard i immediately spotted the first craft i had noticed in the same site. i then scanned the sky with unaided eye and noticed a craft to the northwest of the airport. it had the same light configuration as the other two. i observed these two craft with and without binoculars for about 10 minutes and then went back to my bedroom. i positioned a chair in my bedroom so i could sit and observe the first craft i had noticed. i sat and watched it for about 1\\2 an hour. this object did make some small changes in altitude and position during the time i observed it. the lights on it seemed to be steady except that occassionally the white-yellowish ones seemed to blink. i then decided to go back outside for another look. the first craft was in approximately the same position but the second one seemed to be moving farther away in the northwestern sky. i went back in after about 10 minutes and layed down on my bed, getting up about every 10 to 15 minutes to check on the first craft out my window. the craft in the northwestern sky was obstructed from view out this window by trees. my mom got up at about 2:30 a.m. to use the bathroom. while i was waiting for her to come out of the bathroom, i looked out my bedroom window and noticed the first craft was now gone. i scanned the sky with the binoculars and at approximately the same spot where the first craft had been but very much higher in altitude (i really cannot even guess) i saw what looked like a large rectangular object with it's long side faced toward me and tilted forward so i could see it's top. it was covered in yellowish lights, somewhat like a skyscraper at night with the lights on inside. i caught my mom on her way back to her bedroom and told her about what i was seeing. we both went out on the front lawn and neither one of us could locate any unusual lights in the sky. they were gone. the sky conditions on this night were what i would call moderately clear. that is, i could see bright stars and the planets without any difficulty, but the sky was not \"filled\" with stars like it is on a very clear night. the png graphic i have supplied shows the lights that were on a single craft. i could just barely make out some shadowy solid mass the lights were attached to, but could not really discern it's shape. from the configuration of the lights i guessed that it was probably disk or oval shaped. i would say the location of the first craft i saw east of the airport would be approximately above the village of ginghamsburg,ohio just next to the airport on the east and the craft in the northwestern sky would be approximately over west milton, ohio. i would think \"night people\" (police,etc.) of the town i live in would had to have seen what i saw. i noticed it while going to bed, but a police officer had to have noticed it on patrol."],"Date Submitted":"08/26/2008
