I noticed a star that looked as though it was shifting side to side. As I continued watching, it appeared to not be a star but more of a unconfined object of light that was making circular rotations as it slowly moved around in a small area of the sky. I felt enticed to continue watching it, and intrigued by its interesting motions. After watching it for approximately forty minutes, I went inside. When I went back outside about two hours later, it was no longer in the sky."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"13014","Date of the Event":"10/12/2008 09:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13014.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13014.html"],"Latitude":"42.473701","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Hubbardston","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.473701,+-72.006188(13014)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13014) map </A>","Region":"Massachusetts","Log Number":"US-10122008-0002","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-72.006188","Summary":"multi-colored light moving in circular rotations making slight movements around a possibly specific area."}
