Could not tell what it was but it was white in color and what looked to be flashing (this is in full sunlight) I then noticed off to its left a second object of similar size and activity to the right of it. I observed this for about 2 minutes while i had one of my sons grab my camera. within about a minute or so the 2 objects got closer together and were side by side both still flashing white. (possibly a tumbling motion) My son not finding my camera forced me to go in the house and get it. figuring on the speed they were moving they would be in front of the house when i got back outside I went out front only to find 1 of the 2 objects more to the east now where i snapped a few photos before i lost sight of it behind the trees about a half mile away."],"Log Number":"US-04132011-0009","Case Number":"28658","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Object Shape":"Disc, Flash","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Lexington","There were no other sightings in Lexington on or around April 13th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Lexington","Latitude":"38.047374","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.495036","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28658.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28658_submitter_file1__IMG_7901.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28658_submitter_file2__IMG_7903.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28658_submitter_file3__aIMG_7903.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28658.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
