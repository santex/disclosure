[i got up], put my hand on the door,walked toward the bathroom, put my hand on the wall, looked to the right intothe dining room, and saw this black figure [it was if it reflected no light atall]. then i went into the bathroom. i got the toothpaste, started to brush myteeth, then thought about the figure. i peeked out of the bathroom, didnt seeanything [in the dining room any more]. the figure had been so black that i sawno features. there is lots of light in our house from streetlights, etc. [so ishould have been able to see more than i did.]the head was rounder than ours. it also seemed bigger but not grossly. it wasnot my nephew [who was living with us at the time], [he is] too tall. theheight of the black figure was about 4 feet 8 inches to 5 feet tall, it was alittle shorter than my mom, who is 5 feet 1-1\\2 inches tall.other experiencesmy experiences go back to 1988; the first time was probably in july. it was atnight, i heard a sound like thousands of blowtorches. i couldnt move. [she wassleeping on the sofa on the porch at home.] i dont know how long it lasted, itseemed like forever. then it cut off, and i ran to my parents room. i calledthe police, they informed me that they had just received a call from someonejust a couple of blocks from me regarding an unusual sound. another person iknow who lives in the camden area about a mile from the nsp generator plant,says they may have been letting off steam, but no way should i have heard it,since i live over 6 miles from the plant. i called nsp and they informed methat they only let off steam about every ten years, and they said no way could ihave heard it from where i live.three weeks later my parents were on the porch, around midnight, [theyapparently heard the same sound i had heard,] my dad wanted to go out, but thesound cut off suddenly. a month later [after the entity experience], [approx. december 1988] dad washome, i had the same out-of-sync experience, with the wave thing. [i wasstarting into the bathroom], dad said to me what are you doing? you just wentinto the bathroom half an hour ago! he said i was wearing a white night gown. i didnt have a white night gown!years later, my nephew told me of hearing about abductions. [i hadnt heard ofthem.]my most recent experience was at the end of march this year (2000). has anyoneever had the experience of coming back into their body? it felt like somethingbeing thrown at me; it bounced off my bed, into me. our dog was still alive andjumped up, because she heard it. it felt like it hit my chest area, but it hiton the left [side of my bed] first. it was about early morning, i have it in myjournal.[from notes taken during telephone interviews on 9-18-00 and 10-19-02, andwritten testimony from the witness in october, 2002. william i. mcneff]"],"trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Minneapolis","There were no other sightings in Minneapolis on or around September 30th 1988"],"Summary":"Report of a black, non-reflecting entity, of human","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.262386","Date of the Event":"09/30/1988 06:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Case Number":"1958","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Minnesota","Latitude":"44.989895","Tags":"City","Log Number":"","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1958.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1958.html"],"City":"Minneapolis","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
