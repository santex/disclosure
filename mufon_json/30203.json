Then I said I could hear an engine running. Then again I thought that it was a motorcycle passing, and after the motorcycle had passed the object was silent as it passed with no noise at all. We watched it for about what seemed to be 2 minutes. It was heading south east at a steady rate until out of sight. It was very bright for twilight. With some shimmering. I have spent many hour of my life watching the sky and have never before seen anything like this. I have seen meteors, space station, comets, northern lights, and satelites. But nothing like this."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30203.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30203.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.262715,+-85.320714(30203)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30203) map </A>"}
