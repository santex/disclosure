Asked wife to leave room because she was talking too loud for me to hear TV. She went out on the balcony and saw the lights, then called me to see. I observed lights and called my parents to see. By then I observed at least two vehicles stopped at side of road. Occupants were also looking at the same lights. One by one they dissapeared. Looked kind of like lanterns that were released from a wedding. I say this because of the speed and direction they moved (Moved with the wind), had no distinct formation and then disapeared one by one, not all at once. All objects flew the same direction. Objects were gone before we could get a camera. I'm writing this besause I'm sure there are several other witnesses other then myself and my family and would like to know others observations."],"Object Features":"None"}
