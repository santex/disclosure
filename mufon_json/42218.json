do they just want to discover and study alien life like humans or is there something more sinister going on? why would multiple crafts be here almost every night using up all their time and energy? what i want to know the most is why did those two crafts need to land on the ground and where did they go and what did they do that night? i tried to capture this event on video but the objects were too small and it was too dark for it to show up on my phone but if i find a good camera i'll try again."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Indian Hills","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Colorado","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42218.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42218.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
