Never saw anything like it before! It was high over approaching dark, rain clouds coming from the west over the mountains but eventually disappeared behind them. I first chose not to report it and then decided maybe someone else saw it so made a report September 12. I was OK with the sighting, thinking I'm now one of them who has seen an UFO."],"Case Number":"3975","Tags":"City","Summary":"Canister, white firey, size of a penny, moving from south to west at high altitude","City":"Westminster","Region":"Colorado","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Windy","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date Submitted":"09/11/2005 07:07 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.825428,+-105.049882(3975)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3975) map </A>","Longitude":"-105.049882","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
