Very slow turning aruond as i flew and turned direction like a rotisserie. Around or close to 7 PM After observing for about 3 minutes a second light cigar shaped, very luminous appeared behind. I snapped several photos with my phone but only one shows both. The dark one seems not to have registered in the other photos. Witnesses by two (2) people. Would like to know if there are any similar reports. They both were silent and did not appear to be any known conventional aircraft."]}
