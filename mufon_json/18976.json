Later, on Monday, I uploaded the picture to my computer. But, to the left of the moon there appears an apparent object or perhaps partly illuminated cloud. Humorously, it appeared like a giant bug to me, but I did not see it when I took the picture. The picture is appended. Was there a giant caterpiller watching your presentation? I doubt it."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18976.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18976_submitter_file1__Picture001.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18976.html"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","Date of the Event":"08/29/2009 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.842809,+-87.823114(18976)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18976) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08312009-0005","Summary":"just image in sky","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.842809","Date Submitted":"08/31/2009 07:24 UTC","Case Number":"18976"}
