The foreign object, located in the southern sky, approximately 7-8\" inches south east of another star was relatively motionless. The duration of the sighting lasted maybe 10 seconds, although it may have been in the sky longer without my knowledge. As I began to examine the object closely with my naked eye, the cone shaped light beneath the star began to fade away. Almost simultaneously the bright star attached above it also disappeared. It seemed very peculiar how the object disappeared, given the fact that the sky was clear of any clouds. This is unlike anything I have ever seen before. At the time of the sighting, I felt a sense of composed excitement. A part of me felt honoured to have experienced the sighting, while another part of me felt the urge to share the expereince with others. Sooo, what was this?
