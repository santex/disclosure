Approximately 1000 PM. Greenacres City, FloridaMy friends 11-year-old son and I were sitting out on my patio waiting for thepizza man. My patio faces northnorthwest and I am quite familiar with the airtraffic from Palm Beach International Airport.A light appeared in the sky. It was blue and red and it was strobing very fast.It rose, dropped, and flew in a continuous, quick, bizarre half circle pattern,as if it was hanging from a pendulum that someone was dipping in the dky. I raninside to get my friend and she saw it for a few seconds herself. The entiresighting lasted only about 20 seconds, but it was impressive."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Pendulum light near W.
