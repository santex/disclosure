(one aircraft was flying east and the other aircraft was flying west.) four us watched it and took a video of it. the direction of the object was to the \"south and west.\" comments: this is an unusual sighting given characteristics described. i am not sure what the witnesses sighted. i am trying to obtain a copy of the video. any updates will be posted. went outside at about 9:30 pm with friend to smoke a cigarette. we see very similar object to that described above but more tight and triangular lights [~ 6 or 7] than little dipper described above but \"dipper\" did come to mind but much brighter than any stars and tighter cluster than dipper. large, sometimes lights steady, sometimes lights flickering. white lights mostly, occasionally, a few lights greenish blue when flickering. south of our location about 20 degrees, it moved very slowly from from east to west [over about an hour and a half] to about 30 degrees above the western horizon. we were coming in and out of the house while watching the ufc. we figured it would disappear over the west but around forty five minutes later, around twelve o'clock, we again went out and it was about 30 degrees east of the original sighting. we didn't have any binoculars or telescope available. my friend who has lived there for more than a year, said he never saw anything like it. surveillance came to mind. altitude, unsure but rather high because it looked like an exceedingly bright cluster of stars with a dull white round halo. no sound. we are in a very rural area with many oil and gas wells and large gas storage facilities. any feedback welcome. seen every night from 01\\01\\2011 until today at 5 in the morning from 8:30 pm previous day]. mostly steady with increasing and diminishing intensity, sometimes flashing, variegated colors. during the day, \"airforce contrails\" along the path of the object[s?] from the previous night sky. ten times brighter than the brightest stars and in clusters."],"Longitude":"-99.881232","Region":"Oklahoma","Source":"MUFON"}
