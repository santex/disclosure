I turned it on and pointed it at the night sky. I saw large craft on the camera screen. I thought it was a plane at first. It shot like a bullet over top of white castle and tuned \"very\" swiftly and jerky. When i saw it turn, it was a matalic triangle, with very bright lights, lukley I got it on film. It was at 6:00 A.M. and it kept circling the neighberhood until about 6:50 A.M..
