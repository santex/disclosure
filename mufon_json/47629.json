There were many bright red-orange objects that were floating and moving very slowly before zooming off and then disappearing. After about ten disappeared, we noted that the lights were fading and the objects were turning into black-shaped UFO's that were hard to tell what they were before completely disappearing the view. All of the kids (they were young) were thinking it was some type of balloon or something, but I don't believe it. There were too many, and they were just coming out of nowhere, then disappearing. All in all, there were probably 50. No more came after the brightest one entered the sky, and its lights faded after a few moments before it finally turned into a black looking object and slowly hovered out of view. I'm not sure if it just landed or what. A lot of people saw the occurrence, however-- but none of us know exactly what to believe."]}
