I remembered I had to bring in the US Flag and turn on the porch lights. I stepped outside, and I just took the flag down and started to roll it up on the pole, when I looked up to see which constellations were out. That���s when I saw a very bright white (soft white like a light bulb, but very bright) light just SW of the Big Dippers tail at about 35 to 45 degrees elevation from my position (38��� 32' 58.7\" N, 123��� 10' 6.63\" W). I noticed it at about 20:03h. The Burst of light was traveling away from me in the direction of two of the outermost stars of the Big Dippers Tail. In about 3 to 4 seconds the light started to dim and shrink in size as the got farther away. Then the color of the light shifted reddish as it faded. If I remember my physics correctly, that may be because it was traveling away from me. Eventually it just faded to where I could no longer see it with my naked eyes. I hope this report helps."],"Log Number":"US-09162013-0022","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50868.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50868.html"],"Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"50868","Summary":"Bright light started to dim shift to red and then fade.","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/16/2013 11:32 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.551253,+-122.81517(50868)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50868) map </A>"}
