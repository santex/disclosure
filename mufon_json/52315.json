I hear a loud helicopter which flight path is almost right above us for traffic to Seeley Navel air base and Yuma air base ,so low helicopters not a surprise. I look around sometimes its border patrol chopper around hovering in circles. From the west going east I see chopper lights and strobe then notice aircraft about fifty feet below chopper had no strobe and was a solid green color, as they passed just north of my house I saw the lower craft was not a chopper it was oval shaped about third size of chopper and was a soft green color. Then object stopped dead in its track in an instant,as quick as it stopped it headed north and upward until I could barely see it I notice it looked like it was descending downward it seemed to be a slow descent but could not keep eyesight on object was to small and far away. Feeling were of overwhelmed at the speed of craft and how it could stop dead turn 90 degrees in an instant."],"Date Submitted":"11/20/2013 06:43 UTC","Latitude":"32.757328","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"11/19/2013 06:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"oval shaped light green glowing object about thirty feet long","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.757328,+-115.989998(52315)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52315) map </A>"}
