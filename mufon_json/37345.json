But in this photo it is whirling all over, and seems to be a signature of sorts. if all the star trails did the same thing, I would debunk this as the camera was shaken... this is an UNALTERED photo. I added another photo from the same set of shots as a guide line to what they all looked like."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Honesdale","There were no other sightings in Honesdale on or around September 1st 2011","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""]}
