{"Latitude":"47.61436","divs":["sighting detailson july 4, 1947, i happened to be walking west through woodland park in seattle, washington. i think july 4, 1947, was the correct date because other witnesses (such as a seattle city bus driver and u.s. navy man *(name deleted--cms\\sg) who took a photo of a white disc over seattle on july 4, 1947)also saw ufos over seattle around the same time on july 4, 1947. at the time, i was a 22-year-old student at the nearby university of washington in seattle. the time was around 5:30 pm in early twilight. woodland park overlooked puget sound and the olympic mountain range to the west. i happened to look up and saw a bright, oval or sphere-shaped object descending straight down from the upper atmosphere. as i looked on in sudden surprise, the object made a very sharp and almost 90-degree turn to the horizontal and then sped south along puget sound at high speed. the object was silent and white in color. the total time of the sighting was probably ten or 15 seconds. at first, i thought the white object was an airplane but an airplane would not have come right down from the upper atmosphere and then make a very sharp right-angled turn to the horizontal with no noise of motors the object seemed to be heading toward mount rainier (about 50 miles south of seattle) and mount adams and mount st. helens. after ten seconds or so, the object disappeared from view to the south as it sped south along puget sound. on june 24, 1947, pilot **(name deleted--cms\\sg) and prospector ***(name deleted--cms\\sg) reported seeing nine silvery \"flying saucers\" moving from north to south over mount rainier and mount adams to the southeast. on july 4, 1947, pilot ****(name deleted--cms\\sg) and co-pilot *****(name deleted--cms\\sg) and a stewardess on a united airlines flight said that they saw nine flying saucers (or ufos) flying from southeast to northwest near boise, idaho. on july 4, 1947, a seattle city bus driver and other witnesses in the university of washington area said that they saw ufos over seattle about the same time that i saw the object oer woodland park. u.s. navy man *(name deleted--cms\\sg) took a photo of a white object north of the university of washington near seattle on july 4, 1947. on july 10, 1947, ******(name deleted--cms\\sg) took two photos of a moving disc over phoenix, arizona. my drawing of the july 4, 1947, sighting can be seen in the 1967 book by ted bloecher: report on the ufo wave of 1947. i may have seen one of the nine \"flying saucers\" seen by **(name deleted--cms\\sg) and ***(name deleted--cms\\sg) over mount rainier and mount adams on june 24, 1947, and perhaps one of the similar nine saucers sighted by the united airlines crew members near boise, idaho, on july 4, 1947, and moving from southeast to northwest toward seattle."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"26590","City":"Seattle","Date Submitted":"11/15/2010 11:29 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There was one other sighting in Seattle on or around July 4th 1947"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.61436,+-122.323131(26590)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26590) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"07/04/1947 05:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"On July 4, 1947, I looked up into twilight sky and saw a bright, oval object coming straight down from atmosphere that made a sharp right-angled turn to horizontal and flew south at high speed.","Region":"Washington","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26590.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26590.html"],"Longitude":"-122.323131","Log Number":"US-11152010-0006"}
