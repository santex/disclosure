{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking a picture of the way the sun frames the clouds with the sun behind the cloud cover. With the sun totally obscured the very edges of the clouds appear to be outlined in an extremely bright outline of light. I took 2 photos and did not see anything with the naked eye except the clouds where I was aiming my Kodak Easy Share CX7430 digital camera. When I downloaded the pictures to my computer I saw the Transparent Triangle UFO in one of the pictures. The pictures were only taken a second apart."],"Summary":"Transparent Triangle object with black dot near front","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31678.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31678_submitter_file1__UFOTriangleShip6-23-2009.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31678_submitter_file2__UFOTraingleship2ndpicture1secondlater.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31678.html"],"Log Number":"US-09092011-0017","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Conyers","There were no other sightings in Conyers on or around June 23rd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"06/23/2009 05:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Georgia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"31678","Latitude":"33.582241","City":"Conyers","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.582241,+-84.099349(31678)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31678) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Longitude":"-84.099349","Date Submitted":"09/09/2011 10:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
