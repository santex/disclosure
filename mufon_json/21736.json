{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking along quernmore road when something caught my eye i looked up to my right when i saw a bright round orange coloured light moving very fast. It must have been at least over 1000 ft in the sky,it moved and curved slightly again it was moving very fast then it just dissapeard in the sky. It was a clear sky night and for it to just dissapear like that it was surreal i have never seen anything move and look like that in my whole life. I have managed to record the footage on my cell phone, the qualitiy is fairly poor but you can see the light and how fast it is moving it was such a strange experience that i felt kind of weird afterwards. Im now wanting to investigate this even more i wnt to know were i can find out what aircrafts were in the skys across lancaster any advice and help on this will be much appreciated. many thanks sean robinson"],"Summary":"bright orange ball moving very fast.","Longitude":"-76.303334","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.042076,+-76.303334(21736)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21736) map </A>","City":"Lancaster","Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21736.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/01/2010 03:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"21736","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"GB-02012010-0006","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Lancaster","There were no other sightings in Lancaster on or around February 1st 2010"],"Date of the Event":"02/01/2010 07:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.042076","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
