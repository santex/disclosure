Iwas looking out of the sunroof at a bright star almost directly above us, thenglanced down at the traffic ahead of us. Just as I did, right to the North-westof us, past the town, I saw a big flaming object falling to earth with a longfiery tail. It appeared to me to look like a meteor, and it was falling atabout a 45 degree angle. But the first thing that went through my head was thatit was a military attack, because of the war. But I quickly realized that itwasnt. The object disappeared behind the treeline, but there was no explosionor any indication of an impact. All three of us saw it, but I saw it for thelongest duration. The other two in the car thought at first that it waslightning, but what I saw was MOST DEFINITELY NOT lightning. However, theyimmediately admitted to each other that it was not lighting, as well.This all took place in less than 30 seconds.For the next 5-10 minutes, we continued down Lincoln Hwy. and the entire time, Ikept looking in the exact direction of where the object should have impacted, bymy judgement. And I saw nothing else."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Date Submitted":"03/27/2003 12:50 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"03/27/2003 12:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2201.html"],"Weather Factors":"Windy","Latitude":"40.833385","Tags":"City"}
