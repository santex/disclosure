It was the supermoon night. Something caught my peripheral vision, so I looked straight up in the sky. I saw an object as bright as a planet and about the same size directly overhead. I'm not sure if it was stationary at the time, or if it just seemed to be so because I jerked my head up so abruptly to look at it. Anyway, after I had the object in my field of vision, it then zipped -- as fast as a shooting star if not faster -- from directly above my head to about a point 20 - 25 degrees in front of that in a northwesterly direction. Then just disappeared. I had just watched the space station pass that evening, this was not the space station. I at first thought it was possible a shooting star due to the speed. Is this possible? the only difference was that it had no 'tail' on it and it didn't fizzle out by the horizon, it just disappeared directly overhead after this burst of speed. I live in the south Philadelphia area of the city. I had to check \"affect Psychologically\" because I did get very excited when it happened."],"Date Submitted":"06/26/2013 01:07 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.206862,+-77.187815(48430)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48430) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"48430","Summary":"Object zipping from southwest heading northwest","City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.206862","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":[]}
