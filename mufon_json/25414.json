I went and got some binoculars and saw a bright light with 3 dimmer lights on both sides of it. It changed brightness when the craft rotated about 45 degrees. Then rotated back. I've been watching it for an hour now and it's still there at 11:45. I live on Long Island NY and it's to my south west at about 45 degrees up. I wish I had a telescope to see it better."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/13/2010 11:48 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Looked in the SW and saw a light changing in brightness & got binoculars to see a bright light with several dimmer lights on either side.","Longitude":"-73.30623","Date of the Event":"09/13/2010 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"New York","Log Number":"US-09132010-0013","Case Number":"25414","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25414.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25414.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
