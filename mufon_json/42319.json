{"Log Number":"US-09052012-0015","Latitude":"35.117694","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas in my back yard assessing any damage from the storm and to let my dog run around. I just happended to look up and saw an object above the swift moving clouds, almost at the same height at 1st I thought it was a very large bird, then noticed it was hovering, watched it for a good 6-8 minutes give or take, clouds were moving at high rate of speed and I know it sounds ridiculous however it seemed like it was \"hiding\" and using the clouds to it's advantage. I had the feeling it knew I was watching it and it shot off at a tremedous speed. From the best description I could give it looked like a Brownish cigar shape object, wish I would have had my cell phone, but was afraid it would take off before I could locate....... Left me feeling very spooked and VERY uneasy."],"Summary":"Looked like a \"Brown Cigar\" Hovered for a good 8 minutes then seemed like \"it \" knew I was watching it, took off at a very high rate of speed.","Date of the Event":"09/01/2012 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42319.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42319.html"],"Case Number":"42319","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/05/2012 05:35 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.117694,+-89.946741(42319)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42319) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cigar","Longitude":"-89.946741","trends":["There have been 62 other sightings in Memphis","There were no other sightings in Memphis on or around September 1st 2012"],"City":"Memphis","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Tennessee","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States"}
