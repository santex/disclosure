In the West not too far away, I saw two bright white light (huge) heading towards where I was. I ran for my camera in my car and then it was above me, low enough that I could see a distinctive triangular shape with three red lights blinking and a row of red lights in the center. It moved slowly overhead as I filmed it the best I could. I do not recall any noise. I did state on my video that I have never seen a \"plane\" like that if it was a plane. It was quite large and the shape is what made me feel that it was not a plane. Planes move much faster than this was moving, especially if they are directly above. The lights blinking underneath were huge, the main three being in a triangle."],"Latitude":"29.189059","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.189059,+-82.133302(32450)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32450) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Ocala","There were no other sightings in Ocala on or around October 6th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Ocala","Region":"Florida","Longitude":"-82.133302","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"10/08/2011 09:21 UTC","Summary":"Triangular shape UFO with three large red blinking light and two large white"}
