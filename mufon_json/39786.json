It was a little after four in the morning and I was getting set up for fishing. It was very dark and I was passing the time looking at the starts and I saw this object to the South West just above the silhouette of a mountain on the right side of Mt. Carson. The object was glowing red with toe nail moon white light moving clock wise around it. It was going up and down and then would go sideways left and right. My feeling was Am I seeing this or what. I walked over to a fisherman on my right and I said \" I know you think I' m pulling your leg, but look up there. It' s a UFO. He looked and didn't say much. He said \" oh yah\". Anyway I went back to my to fishing spot and it drifted away behind the mountains. It was pretty far away, but I saw very clearly. This is the second time in twelve years I have seen a UFO here in the Sierras"],"Date Submitted":"06/24/2012 11:16 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/28/2012 04:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-06242012-0032","Latitude":"37.784422","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.784422,+-119.070823(39786)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39786) map </A>","Summary":"UfO sighting near Silver Lake Calif.","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39786.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39786.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
