They said that there were UFO's in the sky so my mom, sister, bro and father quickly got into the car to see what was going on. Sure enough, there were three orange oval like bright objects that formed a triangle shape. It was hovering the mountains. Then it went away. We drove back home and then we see about 4 or 5 of them all lined up hovering the mountains. It looked like it landed. We couldn't believe what we were seeing."]}
