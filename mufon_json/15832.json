I was trying to prove that you can make out an object in the sky taken with cheap (iphone) technology. I wanted to know why these ufo photos are always so grainy and suspect. And thought, if you practiced shooting planes and helicopters with decent equipment, you should get a pretty good picture. As I stepped out of my work place that day, I saw a copter hovering above the expressway and decided to test my idea. 2 days later while watching UFO Hunters I remembered the photos. To my surprise I had captured these other objects. One directly above the copter, the other to the left at about 11:00. I took 2 shots one after the other. I thought it might be a bird at first, but it should be smaller than the copter. Or a plane taken at an angle, that distorted its characteristics, could be! 22 years in the Navy and 5 aircraft carriers, I think I should be able to tell the difference. So what do you guys think."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/26/2009 05:20 UTC","Longitude":"-75.162449","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.954495,+-75.162449(15832)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15832) map </A>","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around February 26th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
