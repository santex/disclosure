I thought nothing of it until i went back and looked at the pictures. In one frame there was nothing there, but in the next frame maybe 3 seconds later, I noticed a very faint orange ballon shaped object. It appears that this orange ballon had ripped through a part of the sky leaving a white trail behind it . I only have one picture of the sighting"],"Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"08/29/2009 02:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"California"}
