I emailed her directly for the pictures and she just responded today... I have 4 pictures that I will include. You will notice that the object is to the left of the moon and it started off with 2 light and then went to 4. After speaking with Roger Marsh, he suggested that I submit them to you."],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
