To me it looked like a square and was red or orange maybe both but it look like fire to me. It was not moving all that fast I would like to say the speed of an airplane in the night sky. I will also say the night was very clear and you can see every star in the sky. I am not the only one who saw it there were many. I just felt like I should report this because it is to real to ignore..."],"Case Number":"46808","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Sebastian","There were no other sightings in Sebastian on or around April 16th 2013"],"Latitude":"27.820705","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
