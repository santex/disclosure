I was outside watching the classes change when i heard a loud explosion in the distance followed by the ricochet of the sound off the ground. So i looked up thinking i would catch a glimpse of a jet going supersonic. But then another happened right after it. I looked up along with the other students and saw two white lights flying from east to west. They were basically streaks in the sky only for a few seconds as they dissappeared over the mountain range. At first i thought it was just one of the air force bases doing some practice runs. But I was military for 6 years years and have never heard of the air force doing supersonic runs over a city. It seemed weird to me that there were two in such short time followed by the light anomaly."],"Date of the Event":"06/15/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"18496","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There were no other sightings in Colorado Springs on or around June 15th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/15/2008 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08052009-0012","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18496.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18496.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown"}
