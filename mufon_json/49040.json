I watched as single lights broke away from main body. As they broke away the lights would go off. This went on till all lights left the main body and lights went off. Over time as they turned on as if in communication it was only for a few seconds and would turn back off. As the sky was filled with these smaller strobing white lights not blinking but strobing tiny lights. I tried to video these with a cell phone but the larger ones would not stay on long enough to catch them...only the smaller ones strobing and they were so small only a speck would appear on video."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"07/17/2013 10:15 UTC","City":"McAlester","Date Submitted":"07/19/2013 03:59 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-95.767113","Log Number":"US-07192013-0003","Latitude":"34.94133","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"truly a light spectical","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Disc","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.94133,+-95.767113(49040)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49040) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49040.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49040.html"]}
