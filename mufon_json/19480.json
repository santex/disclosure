It was 7:50 pm on Saturday September 19th, 2009. A large light appeared at what seemed a very high altitude in the sky south east of Shamokin. After what seemed to be a matter of a few seconds this glowing light emitted a spotlight that lit up the sky below the craft. The craft then, what I can describe as blinking out of existince, disapeared. The spotlight resonated for a few seconds after the ball of light was gone. There was no sound and a cloudless sky. I feel very priveleged to witness what I did. There are approx. 10 other witnesses to this event that were present at the time. I don't know of anyone else in town seeing it as of yet because it happened only yesterday. I emailed the local newspaper about this event and have not yet received a response."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19480.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19480.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 07:50 UTC"}
