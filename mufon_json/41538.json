It appeared to be a satellite, but was much too bright. It was similar in brightness to the star Sirius, so it really caught my attention. I checked the satellite database and no satellites were scheduled to overhead during this time. I did see it pass above and fade in and out though what little cloudcover we had. I did notice contrails at high altitutude in the East, in a criscrossing X pattern in the direction this object was heading."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
