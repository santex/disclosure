A bright orange light appeared with 3 other lights to its right and some distance from it. The two top lights of the group of 3 seemed to be slowly moving around each other. After some time the 3 lights disappeared and the one light was left. Shortly after the 3 re appeared but had ascended to a higher position. This time the 2 bottom lights seemed to be slowly rotating around each other. We got this footage on the camcorder. The entire incident lasted just over 5 minutes."],"Case Number":"31996","Object Shape":"Circle","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/20/2011 08:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Hesperia","There was one other sighting in Hesperia on or around September 20th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"34.428849","Summary":"4 Amber Lights hovering then 3 changed position","City":"Hesperia","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31996.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31996.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None"}
