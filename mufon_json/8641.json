(i do not have a scanner and would need to get my hand-drawings scanned at a copy center). the event happened one hour and 10 minutes prior to my entry of this report. i noticed the object due to its contrast to the sky, its unusual motion, and due to my interest in such topics. my feelings\\reactions were curiosity. i was slightly excited to be witnessing, yet trying to determine what the object might be - a lightweight balloon, a plastic disc, etc. only when i exhausted the alternatives (as i observed the object), i decided to make notes and submit the report. i was calm and clear-headed through the event."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8641.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8641.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/20/2007 05:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ohio","Latitude":"39.962296","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.962296,+-82.991794(8641)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8641) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/20/2007 05:15 UTC","City":"Columbus","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"oscillating disc with constant altitude and trajectory south-east to north-west passed directly overhead","trends":["There have been 70 other sightings in Columbus","There were no other sightings in Columbus on or around December 20th 2007"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
