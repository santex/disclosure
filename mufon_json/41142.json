The object was hovering. I couldn���t make out if it was a star or planet, but seemed a little too big for either. After about 15 mins, the bright object dimmed and disappeared. A few secs later, the object reappeared in the same exact spot. This happened about three times. Finally at exactly 4am, the object shot up into the sky in a matter of secs, leaving a thin light of light behind it. Also, if you looked closly and focued, you would see an odd sheped antenna on the top and tail end of it. I tried to take a picture, but my camera froze about 7 times and would not let me take a picture."],"Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 03:00 UTC","Latitude":"42.077911","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome","City":"Glenview","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/25/2012 05:47 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07252012-0015","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.077911,+-87.781661(41142)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41142) map </A>","Case Number":"41142","Summary":"Oval shaped object that was really bright, hovering in the East sky of Illinois.","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Flash, Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41142.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41142.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41142.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Illinois"}
