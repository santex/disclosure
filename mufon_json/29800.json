The light reminded me of a halogen spotlight intensity. It was at least 5 times the size of Venus at full magnitude. It was a constant light with no blinking lights that are seen on conventional aircraft. It flew overhead toward the southeast horizon. The light stayed on a straight course but did seem to slow down as it reached the sky above me. No sound was emitted from the object. It appeared to be flying halfway between the ground and the cruising altitude of jets. As it reached the Southeast sky the light quickly faded out and abruptly disappeared. It was nowhere near the horizon and should have been visible for another minute or so before disappearing. I have spent countless hours looking at the night sky and have never seen anything like this. I had an obvious feeling that I was watching something that was not anything conventional."],"Case Number":"29800","Latitude":"38.483436","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Very bright constant light flew overhead with no sound and quickly disappeared"}
