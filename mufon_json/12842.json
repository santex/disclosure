On Niagra st. Navy housing, NewPort R.I. I was sitting on the stairs in front of my house with a group of friends. There were alot of people sitting outside their stairs on that cool night around 7:00 pm. I looked up and so did everyone else on that street. There was a ufo just flying slowly right down the middle of the street. About 80 feet up. I ran in the house to get my mother. She came outside and said I believe in ufos but not little green men. My brother and I chased after it. It stopped and then a flame shot out from under. It went straight up. It was round and gray, with two longated windows. It had an entena on top."],"Date Submitted":"07/07/1972 07:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09292008-0013","Object Features":"Window(s), Appendage(s)","Date of the Event":"07/07/1972 07:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.496622,+-71.309628(12842)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12842) map </A>"}
