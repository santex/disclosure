{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe fireball appeared in the southwestern sky and flew over stoney creek metro park right above the heads of many fireworks spectators who gapped in shock and some in fright. for five minutes people snapped photos of the ball of light. it finally disappeared to the east. Many people talked about it soon after. We were at stoney creek metro park. I first noticed the object when i was watching the crowd and for some reason looked up. At first i thought it was ball lightning because it happened during a thunderstorm but it acted unlike ball lightning. It seemed to take notice of the crowd and left its original course to fly toward us all. It moved smoothly through the air and seemed interested in the people. at that moment I felt true fear. Soon though I felt that it would not harm anyone. After the sighting I felt relieved and filled with awe. I lost sight of the object when it crossed across the horizon."],"Longitude":"-83.026612","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around July 2nd 2011"],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2011 08:29 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Object Shape":"Fireball","Log Number":"US-07052011-0051","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"small red ball headed northeast at 25 miles per hour","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30001.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30001.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"30001","Date of the Event":"07/02/2011 09:45 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Washington","Latitude":"42.733826","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.733826,+-83.026612(30001)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30001) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Disposition":"IFO"}
