I was just looking up in the sky and noticed 2 silver acorn looking objects hovering over us, they were at a 45 degree angle from one another and move symetrically together,they stayed at the same angle at all times and moved in a circle around us, I would say they were about 2000 ft above us. I told the 3 men what i was watching,2 guys said it was balloons, the other was in awe.If they were ballons they would have floated away and woulnt stay in unison at all times. As we continued to watch, they remained at the 45 degree angle stopped, hovered over us, and then rose straight upuntil we lost sight,"],"Summary":"2 separate objects hovering overhead.","City":"Yonkers","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Yonkers","There were no other sightings in Yonkers on or around November 30th 2002"],"Log Number":"US-11272008-0010","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14084.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14084.html"],"Longitude":"-73.894307","Case Number":"14084"}
