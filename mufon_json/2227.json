The phone rang in the family room. All of a sudden the phonegot staticy. I thought why is the phone so staticy. So I changed phones and wentto the living room. Then I saw it. I was looking out thw window like I alwaysdo. I thought the UFO was a UFO. After all, it was hovering only 15-20 ft. abovemy neighbors house. When I first saw it my reaction was oh my G-d. It is real.The UFO was hovering above my neighbors house just hovering there. There werethree distinctive lights going around it, red, blue, and green. I went back onthe phone and it was dead. So I went to go get a camera. Unfortuantly when Icame back, it was gone. I saw no more of it."]}
