Object was at a very high altitud and strobing, to high to get a picture on film, which I tried. It flew in perfect paralell formation. They always stayed the same distance apart from each other. We were unable to see outline due to altitude in sky. The lights looked stacked like one on top of the other. Then following this object, was a solid RED craft at a VERY rapid rate of speed, until we could not see either objects any longer. Is there anyway to check radar over the area at this time with a 5 minute buffer to see what was flying overhead in formation? We are located next to a DOE facility. This was seen by two people."],"Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.635385,+-89.397378(17428)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17428) map </A>","Log Number":"US-06122009-0002","Region":"Illinois","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":[],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-89.397378"}
