After driving around for ten minutes or so, my wife spotted the object towards the north east side of town. As I stopped the car and stepped out of the vehichle, I witnessed the amber light flicker as if on a metalic surface. It was several miles away, and around 1,500ft to 3,000ft? (or maybe higher) in the sky. I have no way of describing just how large the light was, but I am guessing sizeable. It moved in the same general direction, but not necessarily in a straight line. There were no flashing aircraft lights, only the amber flicker. It moved slowly, before stopping in mid air. Suddenly it gained several thousand feet in altitude (almost straight up) in a matter of seconds, before turning bright (almost stoplight red) as if on fire, and then vanishing. I was unable to take photos, or video. The exact duration of time wasn't very long. But i know it was no plane."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.227856,+-98.194493(9069)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9069) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/19/2008 08:55 UTC","Summary":"Flickering amber light.
