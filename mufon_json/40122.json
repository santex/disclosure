My wife and I came out on the deck at 9:30 pm and watched for a few minutes. She grabbed me and said \"what's that?\". I turned and looked to the southwest and saw a glowing ball of what appeared to be a flame approaching at a high altitude. There were no fireworks being set off from that direction and the wind was coming from the northwest. The object glided at a steady but not fast pace. I ran in to get the binoculars. The object was heading in a northeasterly direction. A closer look revealed a ball type object that appeared to be on fire. I thought maybe it was a glowing piece of firework, but it appeared to be too high in the sky and movied at a steady pace against the wind. The object continued to travel until it appeared to go above the cloud cover. It made no sound and was observed for about three minutes. We both have never seen anything like it."],"City":"Canonsburg","Log Number":"US-07032012-0028","Summary":"Neighbors lighting fireworks to the north.
