This happened heading home from White Plain, NY on the ramp gettng onto 287 or whatever the main highway was. I was in disbelief and told the person that i was on the phone with what i just saw and asked them what it could be. they told me i just saw a UFO. I thought i had, but couldnt believe it. Please someone disprove me and tell me what else this could have been. i dont see how it could have been a sattellite, airplane, commet, or shoot star... it was moving too fast to be any kind or airplane and then just dissappeared after only being visible for a second or 2."]}
