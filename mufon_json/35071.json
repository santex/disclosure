We lost sight of them for a few seconds but once I pulled over, my daughter spotted them again and we watched them for about 30 more seconds before they disappeared. After we lost sight, I noticed numerous planes racing toward that spot, then a few minutes later, a military-type helicopter flying in the general area."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35071.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35071.html"],"Case Number":"35071","Longitude":"-105.776347","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/23/2012 02:27 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/23/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Latitude":"39.551641","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01232012-0010","trends":[],"Region":"Colorado","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
