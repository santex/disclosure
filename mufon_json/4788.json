{"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on a flight from Cincinnati to Houston last night, I was listening to some music and I was looking out the window on occasion to watch the sun set. I looked this particular time and I was noticing a cloud formation and I looked to the right and I saw another plane going by the opposite direction and I noticed the contrail. I looked back at the clouds and I noticed a cigar shaped object and as I looked another plane with a contrail was heading in the direction the the right of the objecta dn I thought that it was rather large in comparison to the plane. I continued to watch the object as we were passing south and it became a dot that I watched until it was out of sight."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around May 14th 2006"],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4788.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4788.html"],"Case Number":"4788","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"05/14/2006 08:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05152006-0004","Object Shape":"Cigar","City":"Dallas","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Very LARGE cigar shape, slow moving","Longitude":"-96.768523","Latitude":"32.805625","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"05/14/2006 08:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.805625,+-96.768523(4788)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4788) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
