{"divs":["Sighting DetailsToday, as I traveled southeast on Hwy 80 in Geneva , Ga, I approached Hwy 96 and slowed down to turn right onto Hwy 80 , I saw directly in front of me a triangular shaped object in the sky. The edges are clean and sharp, not at all fuzzy or blurred, the surface appears to be shimmering, maybe it is pulsating, not so sure.I reached for my phone to try and get a picture, but it had disappeared. No trail could be seen and nothing was heard. I saw the same craft in the late afternoon sky, again in the south eastern sky back in July. I did not report this then, but now that I have seen it twice I felt like I should. I hope someone else saw this too."],"City":"Geneva","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.578803","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/21/2012 02:26 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.578803,+-84.552536(44699)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44699) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.552536","Case Number":"44699","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Date of the Event":"12/21/2012 12:00 UTC","Region":"Georgia","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Geneva","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44699.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44699.html"],"Summary":"I was traveling in a south eastern direction, had stopped to turn right, when I saw a triangular object in the sky in front of me. it was shimmering, or pulsating, silvery white, had sharp edges and no sounds were heard.","Log Number":"US-12212012-0006"}
