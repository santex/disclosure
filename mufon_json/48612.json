{"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Blimp, Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I were returning from Mcdonalds at around 10pm(despite the late night food run neither of us partake in drugs of any type), and we saw two groups of lights at no more than 500 feet from the ground. They was definitely a solid object between the lights, but we could not make out what it was. It was moving far to slowly and its lights were all wrong for it to be plane(s) or helicopter(s). I am a pilot and I have never seen anything like this. It was completeley silent, but the lights were not like a chinese lantern. If anyone can help me Identify these objects pleas let me know."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"07/04/2013 09:55 UTC","Latitude":"40.641235","Date of the Event":"07/03/2013 10:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-89.395868","Case Number":"48612","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.641235,+-89.395868(48612)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48612) map </A>","Summary":"Strange lights and objects","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48612.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48612.html"],"Log Number":"US-07042013-0024","Country":"United States","Region":"Illinois"}
