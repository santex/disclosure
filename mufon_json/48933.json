My daughter and I remarked that it seemed to be going way faster than commercial aircraft that we normally see. it also was not on normal flight path that the commercial jets take. I could not identify it as an airplane. just bright white. if it was a military jet it was flying faster than sound but we heard nothing. it crossed the sky in about 3 seconds, lost sight of it as it went behind trees."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
