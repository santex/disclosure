First time was back in the spring possibly April or may. I walk the dog for the night. One time I seen 4 glowing redish orange glowing orbs in the north east sky eventually blinking out one by one. Since every other week or so I've seen them in the north west sky. Coming from the horizon or from behind the trees then going up then eventually fading out. The first time I thought it might have been hot air balloons or something. But there has been no hot air baloon launches. Also I've seen these in two parts of the sky. Freelky to say the least ."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"50130","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date Submitted":"08/24/2013 11:38 UTC"}
