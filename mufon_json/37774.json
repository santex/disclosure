It was headed due south in a straight line. When I first saw the object my jaw dropped down because I see Airliners every day but because of the speed,white color and no wing it caught my attention very quickly. I just said WOW. It was traveling to fast to be any regular Aircraft and there is a Airbase in Tampa and I see military planes all the time, the White glow and speed it must been traveling faster than any F-16 or any fighter jet travel a Mach speed. No sound at all I would say it was traveling about 2500MPH or faster"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
