I have no idea what they are and i am not suggesting anything however they are very interesting and everyone will need to make their own conclusion."],"Date Submitted":"11/21/2011 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11212011-0009","Tags":"City","City":"Sunny Isles Beach","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33522.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33522_submitter_file1__CollinsAVpic1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33522_submitter_file2__CollinsAVpic2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33522.html"],"Longitude":"-80.13355"}
