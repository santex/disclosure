He said it was after midnight when all of a sudden a very bright light out of nowhere, right over top shot straight down and lit the tractor and ground around it in a large circle. He said he looked up to see what it was but the light blinded him then the next thing it was gone. With the loud exhaust from the tractor he did not hear anything.It scared him so bad, he left the field and quit.
