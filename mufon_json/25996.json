We went out to sit by the lake to see the stars. The moon is very bright and facing us to the east. To the right is Jupiter. Very few stars are showing due to the brightness of the moon. I didn't see when they appeared but when I looked up again there were two bright stars (slightly dimmer than Jupiter) to the right of Jupiter. I couldn't convice my wife that they were not stars but I've never seen them before so I told her to watch and they would go away. About 20 seconds later they appeared to fade until they were gone. No movement or flashing of any kind. Just disappeared. The lights were 45 degrees from each other - lower left light, upper right light. There were other planes that flew through the area eventually and their movement could be followed for many miles and all had the typical flashing lights. Not a very spectacular sighting but I'm convinced."],"Date Submitted":"10/20/2010 08:04 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","City":"Watkins Glen","Case Number":"25996","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Watkins Glen","There were no other sightings in Watkins Glen on or around October 20th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Two stars appear near Jupiter - bright - fade to nothing","Region":"New York","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25996.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25996.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.381739,+-76.870142(25996)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25996) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
