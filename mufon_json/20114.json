I had seen a UFO before and thought to look up into the night sky when I heard the dogs barking. And I looked up into the sky and a bright star-like object was flashing many different colors; yet I ran outside with a quickness. I was the only one that I am aware of that has witnessed this: my family was asleep and I am not near any neighbors. Coyotes were howling and barking outside. So, I knew the dogs were barking at the coyotes,but, my focus was on the star-like object just hovering in the eastern sky from my house. I can describe the object as moving from north east east to south east direction very slowly. The object was very far away, but distinguishable from an ordinary aircraft. I watched the object outside for about 10 minutes. Than I went back into the house and fell asleep 10 minutes later. It never disapeared from the nights sky."],"Tags":"City","trends":[],"Latitude":"39.017822"}
