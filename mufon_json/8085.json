{"Region":"Chihuahua","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was looking at the sky like usual smoking a cigarette outside then I saw a very bright light like a big star moving south to north, the speed was that of a plane the altitude quite low. There was no noise at all neither any flashing lights as on a plane. It flew over my house then the light became smaller and smaller to finally a tiny little red point and suddenly disapeared. There was no clouds in the sky, the night was really clear and it was very easy to see the stars. Everything lasted about 1 mn."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.707134,+-106.475879(8085)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8085) map </A>","Log Number":"FR-10072007-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8085.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8085.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"8085","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Ciudad Juarez","There were no other sightings in Ciudad Juarez on or around October 27th 2007"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"31.707134","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Country":"Mexico","Date Submitted":"10/27/2007 09:02 UTC","Summary":"bright light no noise suddenly disapeared","Date of the Event":"10/27/2007 09:02 UTC","Longitude":"-106.475879","City":"Ciudad Juarez","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
