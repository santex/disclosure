It just glided then stopped wavered back and forth then continued to glide over our house. I nervously banged on bedroom window to get my sons attention but kept my eyes fixed on the object. My sons came out and seen it as well as my neighbor who asked, \"what is that\". No noise, no blinking lights of any kind. If just kept going, kind of like a glide, and we lost sight of it because of neighborhood trees. My younger son has seen this several times over last year late at night when he goes out to smoke a cigarette. I finally saw it tonight and it was my first UFO sighting!!!! I'll be out late at night back there now and hope to see it again."],"City":"Clarksville","Case Number":"24152","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 12:33 UTC","Latitude":"38.297926","Summary":"Red round globe gliding towards my house and definitely not fireworks.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-85.755733","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Indiana","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Clarksville","There were no other sightings in Clarksville on or around July 4th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:40 UTC","Log Number":"US-07052010-0005"}
