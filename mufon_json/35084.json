I thought it was a military transport that was flying without any navigational lights, it occured to me that I did not hear any engine noise, and the shape shape of the object wasnt quite right for an airplane. My wife was on the side of the car removing my daughter from her car seat and I pointed at the object repeating \"look, look\" and which point she noticed the object. I would descride it as a V shape object with very dim lights down each \"wing.\" We watched the object as it crossed the sky to the southwest exchanging comments as to what it could be, at which point we both noticed that it changed shape and turned slightly to the south. My daughter said she was scared so my wife took her inside, and after watching them go inside I could no longer find object on the horizon."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35084.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35084.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-96.87423","Case Number":"35084"}
