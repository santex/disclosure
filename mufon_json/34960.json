At the end of the year when I was at a gathering of friends, one friend said he saw lights in one of the last nights of the festival, over the dance floor. Until then, he did not know about the photo I picked up in the morning of the festival. Despite the photo, I have not seen any kind of phenomenon. I wonder what you have to say about the picture. greats from Portugal"],"Country":"Portugal","Longitude":"-7.275765","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Oval","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Elvas Municipality","There was one other sighting in Elvas Municipality on or around August 11th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Case Number":"34960","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Elvas Municipality","Latitude":"38.90851","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.90851,+-7.275765(34960)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34960) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
