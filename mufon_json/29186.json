About a mile or so away at approximately a 60 degree angle a small silver dot hung stable for around ten seconds with absolutely no movement. It did not resemble an airplane or any other reflective object such as a balloon. After ten seconds, the circular dot, half the size of a #2 pencil eraser, just blinked out of site (or possibly faded rapidly). I was surprised by its immediate disappearance, looking for contrails or any other sign of reflection pointing to an aircraft maybe switching direction. The weather was perfect with blue skies."],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Iowa City","There were no other sightings in Iowa City on or around May 21st 2011"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05222011-0002","Latitude":"41.667728"}
