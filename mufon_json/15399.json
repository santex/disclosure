{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ontario","Latitude":"49.768682","divs":["Sighting DetailsSuffering a headache, I went outside to get some air, and just happened to gaze up at the bright star in the west, which might be mars, I don't really know. As I was standing there, a much smaller light came into my field of view, and steadily moved across the night sky, passing the bright star. Just past there, it dipped slightly, twice, then slowly raised to the original trajectory. The object was not flashing, as the aircraft that normally pass over do. It was MUCH further up than any aircraft I've ever seen. This was not an airplane, helicopter, or anything else we fly about with. The object continued across the sky, until it was just too far away to see. I was surprised to see this object, but I stood there watching, half expecting it to start flashing like an airplane. It never did, and I watched until it was gone, then went inside, sat down, and told my husband what I saw. After an hour of reflection, I decided to let ya'll know about it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Star traveling with deviation.","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.768682,+-94.483482(15399)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15399) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"02/08/2009 06:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"CA-02082009-0018","Country":"Canada","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-94.483482","Case Number":"15399","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15399.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15399.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/08/2009 06:45 UTC","City":"Kenora","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Kenora","There were no other sightings in Kenora on or around February 8th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
