I thought it was a helicopter going to the hospital with its lights on, but i went closer to the window to notice right away after watching all my UFO shows that it deff was a UFO it was hovering red green orange yellow lights in 4 separate symmetrical placement n the outside of the space craft. It was winter time I threw a house coat on and some boots and sat outside just watching it hover I had no camera at the time which i usually always have or had which really sucked because I know whatI saw was real and there I was talking to a friend on facebook who also saw it in alliston ON , I think we were the only ones who saw it in separate parts of the town. I was eventually tired and it wasint moving so I went to bed and never saw how it left, but all I do know is that it stayed there for a good 45 mins."],"Longitude":"-79.874013","Date Submitted":"08/27/2012 12:36 UTC","Latitude":"44.149486","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"12/18/2011 03:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"42054","Log Number":"CA-08272012-0003","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in New Tecumseth","There were no other sightings in New Tecumseth on or around December 18th 2011"]}
