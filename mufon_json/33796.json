I seen a V shaped craft flying west, it appeared above the neighbors house across the street about 50 feet in the air and about 30 feet from tip to end. There were 5 lights arranged in a V shape, it was silent and made zero noise. i immediatley dismissed this to be anything i have ever seen. the body of the structure where the lights were built to seam like a black transparent body. not solid, but something else. reminded me of when you close your eyes and look into the sun and you see the sun spots. it was almost made of something like that. sounds similar to sightings in spruce grove and beamont areas of alberta i found on another sight. i watched it for a total of about 15 seconds. as soon as i seen it, it was moving so fast, i had to run to the side yard to continue to watch it. it flew past the trees blocking my vision travelled west towards the coast. it has truly strengthened my beliefs of extra terrestrials."],"Longitude":"-115.664388","Date Submitted":"12/03/2011 04:32 UTC","Case Number":"33796","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Whitecourt","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"54.124013","Log Number":"CA-12032011-0013","Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"09/24/2011 11:50 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Whitecourt","There were no other sightings in Whitecourt on or around September 24th 2011"],"Summary":"Triangular craft with 5 lights in a V shape moving west of Whitecourt-was silent, no noise","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=54.124013,+-115.664388(33796)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33796) map </A>","Region":"Alberta"}
