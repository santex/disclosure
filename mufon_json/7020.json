IT WAS DAWN AND I WAS OUTSIDE LETTING THE DOGS OUT. FOR SOME REASON, I BECAME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. I GRABBED MY CAMERA AND CAPTURED THIS VIDEO. IT SEEMS TO BE TWO OBJECTS. IF YOU WATCH BOTH OBJECTS VERY CLOSELY, THEY SEEM TO MAKE SOME VERY UNNATURAL MANEUVERS. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I WATCH IT, THEY DON���T MOVE LIKE BUGS AND THEY APPEAR TO BE A SOLID. THEY LOOK ALMOST ROUND TO ME.
