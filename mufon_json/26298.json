When I first noticed something I saw a diagonal line of 5 lights across the sky in the distance. I thought maybe they were lights from towers or something, but when I got close to one I noticed it was not. It was a triangular shaped craft that was hovering. It had lights on all three points, and on the back there were gliding red and white lights. It then glided across the sky after hovering for a moment. All the way through Martinsville and Indianapolis I continued to see them near the highway. There was even one over my neighborhood near the highway when I reached Indianapolis. When I got home I continued to follow them and try to take pictures, but they weren't very clear photos. I have never seen any unidentified flying objects before! I was very surprised and it felt surreal. I found it odd that there were so many and all across the sky, and spread across such long distances."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/02/2010 02:20 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26298.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26298.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"26298","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.776956,+-86.152004(26298)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26298) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There were no other sightings in Indianapolis on or around November 1st 2010"],"City":"Indianapolis","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","Summary":"Triangular shaped, lit craft hovering in sky across many towns"}
