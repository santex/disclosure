About 3 or 4 seconds after i looked, i saw a Blue circle like, disk shapped object fly by. It lasted for about 2-3 seconds. My first thought was a plane, but then i though that planes could not fly as fast as what i saw. My second theory was, a commet or shooting star, but i had never seen a blue commet or shooting star. So that only leaves one explination, a UFO. The Blue light disappeared from my sight after 2-3 seconds, it went over some trees and then disappeared."],"Log Number":"US-11112008-0001","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Brooklyn Park","There were no other sightings in Brooklyn Park on or around November 11th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13657.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13657.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/11/2008 02:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/11/2008 02:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
