I have a clear view for about 800 ft out and left to right about 1000 ft. then trees block any view. A bright ball of light appeared from my left, travelling left to right. It was about 500 ft. away and took about 3 or so seconds to travel my field of view. it was low, about 100 to 150 ft off the ground. now the intresting part, right behind it, about 200 ft. behind it, was a 2 engined small plane chasing the light. the plane was flying level at the same level as the ball of light. they both flew out of sight in a few seconds. once they got behind my trees I could no longer track them. I called to my wife, but it happened all too quickly. the direction of travel was SW to NE."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30599.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30599.html"],"Case Number":"30599","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/15/2011 09:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08062011-0087","Source":"MUFON"}
