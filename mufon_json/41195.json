It was rather large and seemed pretty high up. It was moving probably twice as fast as a plane. There was no observable sound. It was sort of hard to see because it was through a tree. Im 100% sure it wasnt a plane, satellite, or helicopter. I ran in to grab my ipod and film it but it was gone."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.879943"}
