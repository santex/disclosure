Object did not have any lights. It was a very clear, and amlost full moon night, which was illuminating the outer atmosphere brightly. I believe I saw the object only by it being illuminated by the moon. The reason I say that is I was outside cooking, and was observing the sky. I saw the object appear from my right moving toward the left and changing speeds, but not trajectory.I watched the object until it went out of view. It appeared come into view, and go out of view once it was out of the correct vantage point to have the moons light reflecting off of it towards me."]}
