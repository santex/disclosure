I couldn't tell how high they were. The first two were in single file. The second two were side by side and the other two were in single file. When each got to a certain point in the sky they dissappeared. Several family members and friends witnessed the same thing. The next night , Sunday May 1 we went out at the same time and saw the same thing except all were in single file. They dissappeared in the same place as they did the previous night. I thought they might be helcopters but there was no sound and they vanished. We saw them April 30, and May 1, 2011 heading west."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"North Carolina","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28943.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28943.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"05/04/2011 07:22 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05042011-0010","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"28943","Date of the Event":"04/30/2011 09:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"6 orange orbs. single file 1 night / 2 side by side first night /4 in line","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.861842,+-77.994433(28943)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28943) map </A>","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.861842","Longitude":"-77.994433","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
