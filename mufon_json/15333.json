{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-02062009-0001","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Chevron, Saturn-like, Star-like","Date of the Event":"02/01/2009 08:30 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsa very bright white, large, single, star-shaped object in westernly sky observed from 2nd floor apartment building window. no visible navigational lights, only the big, very bright white, 'overall' light. did not appear to move. no sounds heard. distance unestimatable, but at least several miles. the moon was an amber \"god's fingernail\" and low-hanging in the sky. the object was approximately at an 8 or 9 o'clock position inside the center of the window frame. the moon was not observable from this angle & i had to turn my head, while crooking my neck towards my left shoulder, in order to observe the moon outside the window frame at an apparent 11 o'clcok position. this would then be to the left (south) of the ufo and the moon was already low in the sky...the object was lower than the moon. it was a semi-cloudy super bowl evening (02\\01\\09). i observed fixed-wing aircraft with navigational lights that were visible nearby the moon. nothing was near the object. this was brought to my immediate attention by my friend who rents a room there with 2 other room renters. he did not observe it for very long. no camcorder was available, so i, alone, observed it for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. my friend went by the window around 10:30 pm and reported that it was gone. i got up to look out the window & it was not observable from inside the window frame, so i looked outside all areas of the window frame and it was apparently gone. the moon was now inside the window frame at about the same 11 o'clock position (as the earth changed it's axis). i back this up with a sound mind as i was not drinking alcohol or taking any mood-altering substances. we were watching videos at that time. i thought the object might of been jupiter or venus when i first saw it. we both thought that it had 5 points like a star. it was very bright & seemed out of place. i have a stigmatism in my right eye & was wearing my progressive eyeglasses (the type with no lines). i thought maybe it was moving slightly to the right, but unsure, as i kept watching it for a long time. it was a super bowl sunday night and being inside the town of east rochester, ny, i heard honking between 2 cars at a nearby intersection outside the window up the street & wasn't sure if they were observing the object or if it was just the feastivities of the evening. i think i might of remembered some loud talking amongst several individuals near that intersection. no detectable spinning of the object was observed, pretty much motionless, but hanging in the sky. no binoculars or telescope were available, unfortunately. after observing for the 1st several minutes, i asked my friend, \"have you ever seen anything like this before?\" he said, \"no!\". he was very excited and maybe a bit exasperated when he first brought it to my attention; as he came into the room & said, \"you have to put something on your feet & come out & take a look at this!\" after i was done observing for 10 to 15 minutes, i went back to watch the video and he was laying on the bed on his right side, with his arms folded and appeared to be withdrawn & upset. there was a video on, but he had his head aimed down towards his chest towards his folded arms. so i could tell that this event apparently seemed to of upset him. i tried to lightly engage in conversation in regards to it, by saying something to the effect of how we have, \"lights over east rochester\" (alluding to the film \"lights over phoenix\"). he was not privy to making any small talk. so stayed away from saying anything further & settled back to watching the video. we were not watching the super bowl or any of the advertisements or half-time show at all as we are not sports fans. we were watching videos throughout that evening. he had gotten up around 10:30pm & when he returned to the room he said, \"you're not going to believe this, but it is gone!\" i got up to take a look & he was right... it was gone! i viewed the object in a matter-of-fact sense with a reporter's cap on. very sad that another roommate did not see it and way sad that a recording device was not available. my ante was 'up' now for the remainder of the evening. at approximately 1 to 2:30am, i thought i heard a metallic scratching-like noise, which sort of freaked me out. i did not bring it to my friend's attention as he was sleeping. the following morning (02\\02\\09) my friend & i were standing outside the downstair's door entrance to the apartments, as i was waiting to catch a bus to the city of rochester at approximately 9:55 am. i had made a comment in passing to his roommate, who was waiting for a bus also, that my friend & i \"saw a ufo last night.\" his roommate said something in acknowledgement & the bus came shortly right after that."],"Date Submitted":"02/01/2009 08:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Extremely bright with points like star.
