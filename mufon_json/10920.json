We just left it and let it record. Upon reviewing footage there was a definite object in the air going down ward. The Object did change color and shape various times. It went from white cigar shape or (like a sausage dog)with varies black circles around it to a round oblonged object with a different color and a decrease in the black objects around it. At one part it appeared triangular bright yellowish orange and went on to as if someone was swimming in the sky at this point a light purple at the end of footage it was ascending back upward and was white. The video is a must see it took my breath away and made me excited and I will be the first to say I am a skeptic. It is what it is a UFO. Ps would like to place video on internet but do not know how to do that. I am ecstatic."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
