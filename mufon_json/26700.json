{"Date of the Event":"02/17/2010 03:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile using the bathroom at about 3:00 AM I had not turned on the bathroom light yet when I saw four small white orbs in a diamond shaped pattern rise fron the southwest at slightly above ground level and silently travel upward at about a 70 degree angle. They traveled in unison as if connected but I saw nothing between them. They rose to a point where my roof overhang caused them to be out of sight. They traveled silently and in a flat plane and just before I lost sight of them it appeared as if I was looking at their underside. They were baseball sized and seemed to be about thirty feet away initially and about seventy feet high as the rose in a north west direction. I saw a single orb very similar to these about three years ago and recently reported it. In both instances I felt a calm sense about what had just occurred. I then returned to bed as if nothing exciting had happened."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26700.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26700.html"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","City":"Eaton Rapids","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"42.514264","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-84.646044","Date Submitted":"11/22/2010 11:01 UTC","Log Number":"US-11222010-0005","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.514264,+-84.646044(26700)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26700) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Eaton Rapids","There were no other sightings in Eaton Rapids on or around February 17th 2010"],"Case Number":"26700","Region":"Michigan","Summary":"While using the bathroom at about 3:00 AM I looked out the window and saw four small orbs in a diamond shaped pattern rising from the northwest and silently elevate out of sight","Disposition":"Unknown"}
