I had my camera with me as I usually do and decided to take some random pictures of the sky hoping for something to show up. I was holding the camera on my knee pointing directly overhead and above me and took several photos straight up. I did not know this object was above me and did not see it. Later while viewing these photos I found this round looking what I call a orb or sphere in one picture. My camera of choice is a Nikon S630 and all setting were set to automatic."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07292009-0006","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-105.028415","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"18379","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18379.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18379.html"],"Latitude":"39.841853"}
