We stopped the car right in the road. It was oval shaped, no sound, I felt no fear, pulsating from left to right, right to left different colors, I saw yellow and blue, my son later said he saw yellow and green. I said to my son, \"What is that cody,\" he said its not a UFO,\" I said,\" then what is it, we kept repeating that about 3 times. We don't know what it was, I know one thing. My son and I saw the same thing. I felt that I need to drive on because my son was with me. I describe it as 2 regular car lengths, oval shape."],"Object Features":"None"}
