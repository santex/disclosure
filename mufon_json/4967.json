{"Region":"Utah","divs":["Sighting Details9:47PM at end of event. My first ever report probably nothing. Too Lazy to ceck space station orbit. A very bright single light. Spoted it half way across sky and watched it till at end of horizon and 'almost' invisable due to slight cloud cover. No navigation red and blue. Single light, very high. Exactly as a satilite but 10 times brighter. Could see the light as it passed over some light clouds and it was not fully dark out yet. 20 years working aircraft commercial and military."],"Latitude":"41.110777","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Log Number":"US-06202006-0003","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.110777,+-112.026054(4967)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4967) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/19/2006 08:47 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Summary":"Bright light from west to east 9:47PM","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4967.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4967.html"],"Longitude":"-112.026054","Case Number":"4967","City":"Clearfield","Date of the Event":"06/19/2006 08:47 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Clearfield","There were no other sightings in Clearfield on or around June 19th 2006"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
