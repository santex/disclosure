Believe it or not, it was taken for the BBC. I love science of any kind and am an avid viewer of nature films. Recently, I borrowed my sisters copy of Planet Earth the complete series. This is a 5 DVD set. On the back panel of the DVD cover, in a picture of what I assume to be Victoria Falls, I found something that looks like a craft either going into or out of the falls. At first I thought that I was seeing things. I even tried to wipe it off with a damp cloth. I then went and got my magnifying glass and too a closer look. Not certain, but it may be a craft of some kind. If it is, it's like nothing I have ever seen before. I would really like to know what you think of it."],"Summary":"Found photo of interest.","Region":"New York","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.129797,+-76.82079(15470)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15470) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02132009-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15470.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15470_submitter_file1__UFO1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15470_submitter_file2__UFO2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15470_submitter_file3__UFOfullpic.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15470.html"],"Latitude":"42.129797","City":"Elmira Heights"}
