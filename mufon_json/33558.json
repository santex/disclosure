{"Latitude":"36.076105","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out jogging on the 12th as I normally do on the weekends. I decided to jog a nature trail located over in Guilford County. I started my run at about 8am and stopped to rest at about 9:30am. I saw something down the trail from me. It was short like a midget and it was white and had a metalic colored suit on. It was just standing there looking at me. I had not seen anyone else that morning on the trail. I thought it was just another individual ahead of me that had stopped to rest. I get up and continue down the trail. I look at my watch and it was approx. 9:45am. That is all I remember doing. When I woke up, I was back in my car. It was almost 11am. I can still see the dwarf in my memory. I keep repeating it over and over in my head, tryng to remember what happened. I can't remember anything other than being very tired when I woke up in my car and having a small cut just behind my left ear. I wish I could remember more."],"Case Number":"33558","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.786455","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Greensboro","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33558.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33558.html"],"Log Number":"US-11232011-0012","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/23/2011 07:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"North Carolina","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Greensboro","There was one other sighting in Greensboro on or around November 12th 2011"],"Summary":"I was abducted by a Dwarf Like being with milky white skin and metalic like jumpsuit","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.076105,+-79.786455(33558)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33558) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"11/12/2011 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
