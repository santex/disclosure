The wife stepped out seconds after I first noticed the light and soon we were both watching as it slowly approached our area. I estimate the light to have been at least 8 to 10,000 ft. as judged by local air traffic in and out of Nashville. A departing airliner passed over our house and was headed west in the vicinity of the object (light). The object slowly began to fade it���s light as the airliner approached till it completely faded out. The airliner flew past the area but the object never reappeared. I am seeing these anomalous night lights with frequent observations this month. A consistent observation I have made is that these lighted objects will fade with approaching aircraft and will suddenly appear when there is no air traffic in the vicinity."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"01/21/2009 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City"}
