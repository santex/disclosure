For the last 4 months not only myself but on many occasions this has been witnessed by many of my friends and family.These sightings have been occurring around the so.st.louis and so. co. areas.I have no ajenda and nothing to hide. These are real! This last sighting lasted approx. 1-2 min. the orb traveled north to south very slow and flew kinda like a drunk driver with no sound it then seemed to stop and it just vanished. My nephew and his girlfriend live with me and they see it almost daily also. Is anyone elese seeing this? I will be ready next time and will take pictures and video."],"Longitude":"-90.28725","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in St Louis","There were no other sightings in St Louis on or around November 29th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.56092,+-90.28725(33748)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33748) map </A>","Case Number":"33748","Latitude":"38.56092","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"11/29/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
