It was overcast and no stars could be seen. I rolled down the window to get a better look and saw that it was 4 glowing lights in a diamond shape. I was driving about 35-40 mph and the lights we traveling approx. northeast and a bit slower. I realized then I had no idea what this was because there was no sound. Not sure how high it was flying, but just below the clouds. I slowed down to turn onto Briarwood Drive to stop and get a better look. When I got out the lights kept moving then disappeared into the cloud cover. While driving I used my iPhone to capture video of the 4 lights. I also noticed other people witnessing the same 4 lights."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.78343,+-72.516771(27595)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27595) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/28/2011 08:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Diamond, Square, Rectagular","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-72.516771","Log Number":"US-02012011-0004","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Manchester","There were no other sightings in Manchester on or around January 28th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27595.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27595.html"],"Summary":"4 glowing orange/red lights in the sky moving slowly","Date Submitted":"02/01/2011 10:48 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Connecticut"}
