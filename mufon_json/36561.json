There only a few, but them above the sky line I notice a large silver type object hovering, it appeared large, silver, huge, round and the sun also reflected against it, then is vanished, and reappeared hovering at the same spot, when this occurred, then appeared more and more jets in the sky in all directions as if patrolling the sky in the area where the object appeared, like more that 10-15 jets speeding towards the area where the object was, then in all directions of the immediate area. I stood there amazed at what I was seeing. The object the just vanished as it appeared, as time went by, the jets appeared to dissipate. as if search over, at this time, as the object left, the fly overs at 7:29 pm has stopped.
