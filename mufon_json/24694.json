As I was driving northboud I saw a boomerang bright shiny object (a single object) \"appear\" immediately in front of my line of sight. I blinked, thinking it might have been something in my eye (I was wearing sunglasses). After blinking the object was no longer there. Then once I finished the \"curve\" in CV and headed north...two objects of the same type appeared. As I looked out the window of the car window, they appeared immediately as I looked through the window. The two objects appeared and were visible for about 5 seconds and then just vanished. This experience was very weird for me. I am an educated person (two BS degrees and a Masters). It took me a while after the incident to consider reporting this....but something was there for those brief seconds. I saw the first object and then, later, the other two for just those brief seconds. It WAS not an airplane (given that I was driving by the Madison Airport), it was something else."]}
