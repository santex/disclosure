{"Latitude":"51.62657","divs":["Sighting Detailswhen i was a teenager, i was walking my girlfriend home. there was light cloud cover, very few cars on the road, and good weather. half way up the hill where my then girlfriend lives i could hear a low pitch humming sound coming from over my head, when i looked up, i saw through the light cloud cover, a rugby ball shape yellowish light, with alot of dim white round lights circuling around it at speed , it was moving very slowly overhead i can remember feeling tingles all over my body and so did my girlfriend it kept moving slowly untill the lights going round it went out and all was left is the rugby ball shape in the middle the humming sound stopped and it just dissapeared., i cant really say how high it was, but my observations at the time then, and looking back at it now i would estimate this thing was alteast 3 football pitches in size. the next day there were people saying that all the electrics and computers went down at the same time in a few local factories. and if i remember correctly it was also on the local news the next day, and the explination that was given is that, on the night in question there was a fun fair about 20 or so mies away, and the lights that was seen in the sky was the lights from that fair. i live in a valley, and between where i was and where the fun fair was, id say it was impossible for the lights to reflect of the clouds like they said. the dates i have given is not accurat as it was quite some time ago, the only thing i am certain of is the year and the time, this is because my girlfriend at the time had to be in at 22:30 lol."],"Longitude":"-3.936306","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"19038","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"VERY VERY LARGE","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"10/12/1998 10:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"GB-09022009-0009","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/02/2009 11:27 UTC","Region":"Wales","Country":"United Kingdom","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.62657,+-3.936306(19038)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19038) map </A>","City":"Swansea","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Swansea","There were no other sightings in Swansea on or around October 12th 1998"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19038.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19038.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
