(I had seen it many times over the past month or so and wanted to capture iton camera) VERY bright and changed colors rapidly. A star or satelite Icould tell nothing by the naked eye except it twinkled and changed colors. However ..on looking and magnifying the photos it splits into to 2 then back to one and then seems to shoot lights or some sort of beams out of the bottom at 45degree angles. Just curious as it follows the stars moving with the sky when its there but its not there every night. It dimmed out. (In photos 1) is magnified before splitting 2) seems to split then 3)look at the lower right hand corner of the last one and you can clearly see some sort of lights shooting out. This is non magnified so maybe you can blow it upa bit. Im not to good with this stuff.)"]}
