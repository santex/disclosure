Although resently what I thought was a figment of imagination. Has become a reality, I say this because it has been occurring more frequently, and I feel and seemed to communicate with this object. It's like i become sync with this object, and I am starting to be visited by some form of being. After each visit I seemed to have more innfomation. I did some research of my own , and I have discovered that I have been physically in several location where there have been documented siteings. Dating back to my birthplace in 1969. When ever this object is present I can feel this tone resonating throug out my entire body. I can go on and on, so I will stop hear, but there is so much more to tell!!!"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.920161,+-78.819788(43276)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43276) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/15/2012 06:58 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43276.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43276.html"]}
