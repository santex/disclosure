And of course, no one believes you. So after awhile you just stop telling people and deal with it on your own. California is right - there is usually a very loud buzzing in your head. You can break this - but it does require a strong will and conscience - do not be passive. You may be left alone then because you will be too strong for whatever it is that wants to manipulate us (for whatever reason). Maybe one day we will all understand."],"Longitude":"-87.857783","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois"}
