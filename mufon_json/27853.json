{"divs":["sighting detailsas i was filming some planes that day, nothing really seemed unusual. i was in \"trier - germany\" on the parking of a supermarket. but as i was watching the material at home , in one video , i was surprised seeing 4 or 5 white dots crossing the screen. my first impression was that my camera caused those dots, but as i watched the about 40minutes footage , hey never appeared again. after watching the video several times, i seems to me , that those \"dots\" where in the sky , fyling. so they dont seem to be reflections , because 1. i never had them in my videos ever before. 2. the sun was in the other direction. 3. one object seems to dissapear in the cloud , and in the next frame it reappears behind the cloud. i cannot say that those are aircrafts , because they must have been faster than any aircraft i would know. the only aircrafts which im concerned of , would be some like the black bird. but the black bird is black , and i would have heard it. i have one frame , showing a clear picture of a disc shaped metallic looking object which i isolated in my videos. i was pretty surprised when i watched the footage. here are the videos: *(three links moved to additional evidence section--cms\\sg). i hope to get your interpretations of them. thank you with friendly greetings."],"Log Number":"DE-02162011-0008","Country":"Germany","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"27853","Summary":"very very very fast","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"02/07/2011 01:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Flash, Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27853.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27853_submitter_file1__isolatedandshown.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27853_submitter_file2__contrast.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27853_submitter_file3__blackandwhite.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27853.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"49.746883","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.746883,+6.634751(27853)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27853) map </A>","City":"Trier","Region":"Rheinland-Pfalz","Date Submitted":"02/16/2011 11:46 UTC","Longitude":"6.634751","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Trier","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
