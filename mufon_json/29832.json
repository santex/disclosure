As I lit my cigarette I looked out my bedroom window (the blinds were up) and I saw four amber balls of light in a diamond shape drifting across the sky.I called my husband to see it and as we watched these lights they proceeded to change shape to a triangle type shape. so I ran for the video camera. I recorded the last part of the first \"wave\" and all of the 2nd wave & 2 pictures of the 3rd. The 2nd wave were 6 lights 2 in front and 4 following behind. They wern't very fast & seemed to float across the sky. What are they I don't know. I'm not very technical so I played the tape thru the t.v. and recorded it to my digatal camera. After the 2nd wave I was not expecting a 3rd wave to come by. The 3rd wave was about 8-10 of these balls of light in 2 strange formations. I tried to take pic's of these formations but they wouldn't show up on several pic's,however I do have 2 pic's that show a single ball of light in the lower right of the stills. Sorry for the language in the video,we were shocked!"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.610648,+-71.234225(29832)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29832) map </A>","Latitude":"42.610648","Log Number":"US-07012011-0013","Date Submitted":"07/01/2011 06:37 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/11/2011 09:30 UTC","Case Number":"29832","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-71.234225"}
