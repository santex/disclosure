I went over along with my boyfriend and observed a light that was pulsating blue-red-yellow at times it almost looked like it was swirling.The light stayed there for approx an hour and reoccured for several nights, for about a week. On one particular night I tried recording the light and it drained my video camera. On one night a helicopter with a spot light came down to the top of the tree in my neighbors yard while we were out looking at it. I freaked and hid the video camera, the helicopter stayed for a minute then took off. I thought it was very odd because it came down right on top of the tree and had the spotlight focused on where we were."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13630.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13630.html"],"Log Number":"US-11102008-0005","Date Submitted":"08/31/2001 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.680371,+-84.250073(13630)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13630) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"39.680371","Region":"Ohio"}
