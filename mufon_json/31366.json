I looked up almost immediately and saw a very bright circular light just above the tree tops of the hill directly in front of, but across the road from, my house. The light resembled a hula-hoop stood on its end and was very bright. The center was dark, and it happened so quickly that I could not tell if it was just a circle of light or if the light was actually on the rim of an object, but I was able to clearly see that the light was solid. Probably lasted 30-45 seconds, and then quickly just sort of went out. I have searched online to see if any other people had reported seeing the light, but so far I haven't turned anything up."]}
