{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was in my kitchen washing dishes when there was a very loud sound outside overhead.it became louder and i could feel the house almost shake,i ran outside to see what it was and it was an extremely large disc like object that was so low just barely hovering over our house and continued on over the houses in the neighborhood.i originally thought a plane was going to crash because of the loud sound that you could actually feel..but it very slowly just glided overhead.it was far bigger than a plane or jet and the shape was disc like but with no specific color almost appearing clear but yet you could see it was a solid shape.most recognizable about the shape was the middle with a bright lit up triangle with multi color lights.they did not flash anywhere and the lights in the shape of the triangle always stayed lit.i watched it till it was out of sight,,then my adult son came out to see what was going on and then i told him what i saw out there and pointed to the directions from which it came and went.he then told me of this sight and this is how i came to be here telling you what i just saw.i still cannot believe what i have just experienced..i even walked back out there hoping to see it again but of course i didnt.my son asked me why i didnt call him..i explained to him that when i was out there watching it i was in such awe and couldnt take my eyes off of it.if i ran back into the house i would lose track of it.this is the first time i have seen something like this out here.my son also stated that a friend of ours saw the same exact thing with the same exact description roughly 10 years ago.i am amazed at what i just saw..wish i could see it again..funny i didnt feel afraid once i saw it.no photos."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Cocoa","There were no other sightings in Cocoa on or around March 16th 2011"],"Case Number":"28251","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"flew over home in neighborhood very low","City":"Cocoa","Longitude":"-80.736508","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.393926,+-80.736508(28251)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28251) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/16/2011 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"28.393926","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/16/2011 10:38 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28251.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28251.html"],"Log Number":"US-03162011-0012","Object Features":"Other","Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
