I looked at it and began to focus on it, and didn't see any kind of flashing lights to indicate it as an aircraft (Also the speed at which it was going would have been to fast for it to be an Aircraft.) Instantly me and my girlfriend thought Satellite, that is until it made a sharp almost instant turn. It looked like a star that was moving, like a satellite. A dim little dot going really fast across the sky it traveled across the sky in about 10 seconds maybe less, however it was not a meteor or anything like that.. not that fast. The turn was insanely precise, it made me feel uneasy. This was seen by everyone outside. We lost site of the object as it disappeared behind trees."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.149395,+-118.141226(18148)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18148) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18148.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18148.html"]}
