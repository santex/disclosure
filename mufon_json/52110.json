There was no sound and it light up the whole area. It disaperaed accross the horizion. We didn't think too much about it until after we saw a show about UFO's where 2 airline pilots saw the same green light pass by their aircraft. We have also observed a faint white blinking light that appeared to be at a very high altitude, possibly outside of the earth's attmosphere and it was doing circular movement. We observed this light on numerous occassions at the same time several nights in a row. Again there was no sound and no military activity in the area."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52110.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52110.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"","City":"Tamuning","Longitude":"144.797222","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=13.483889,+144.797222(52110)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52110) map </A>","Summary":"Green conned shape trailing light."}
