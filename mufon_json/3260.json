I noticed but didn t take note of a round white light in my rear view mirror. It didnt move, didnt get bigger or smaller, so i assumed it was the moon. It followed me for about 10-15 minutes. When i finally had to stop at a light, I stretched my neck and looked up to see the full moon through my sun roof. I looked back at the rear view mirror instantly and the light was gone. I dont know what it was, but it was not a car or any type of street light because it was with me for so long."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.748464,+-104.975553(3260)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3260) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.748464","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Denver","Log Number":"","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-104.975553","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3260.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3260.html"],"Region":"Colorado","Date of the Event":"02/04/2005 08:42 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/04/2005 08:42 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"3260","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Not Provided","Tags":"City"}
