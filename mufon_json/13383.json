{"divs":["sighting detailsin fort worth, near i-30 and 820, looking toward the west at the sky, above a 5 or 6 story building, i saw what looked similar to a falling star. but, it was so much larger than a falling star. it was as close to earth as a plane would be. it only lasted for a couple of seconds. i just sat there staring at the sky, not believing what i saw. my friend asked me what i was looking at. i just looked at her with a strange look on my face. i was afraid to tell her. finally, i told her that i saw a large light flying through the sky. she said it was probably a ufo, that a lot of people had been seeing them lately. if i had to say exactly what it was, i would say an object on fire flying through the sky. for a second i thought it might be a meteor. it was very bright, some blue, white and orange colored lights\\fire. i wasn't able to see it long, due to the height of the insurance bldg to the west of us. i wish i had. it's definitely got my curiousity."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Date Submitted":"10/30/2008 02:05 UTC","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"32.727629","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13383.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13383.html"],"trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around October 30th 2008"],"Longitude":"-97.31213","City":"Fort Worth","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.727629,+-97.31213(13383)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13383) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"10/30/2008 02:05 UTC","Case Number":"13383","Log Number":"US-10302008-0006","Summary":"Huge Falling Star Looking Object"}
