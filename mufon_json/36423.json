I heard a loud rumble. I looked up and saw an extremely large (at least the size of our house), fiery orange orb moving slowly, less than 500 feet above our house.It was definitely something I have never seen before! I was so stunned, I left the gate open to my dog's pen and didn't realize it until the object was gone and I collected myself. My wife was on the other side of the house and I shouted to her to look up,look up! The object was moving northwest. We watched it for about 2-3 minutes until it moved too far away to see. It did not have a tail. This event left us shaken. It defied all logic."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36423.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36423.html"],"Log Number":"US-03122012-0014","Longitude":"-81.259763","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Chapin"}
