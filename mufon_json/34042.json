{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-97.43687","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn December 15, 2011 I went out to observe the comet \"Lovejoy\" and it's sister flying over our home this evening, it was so beautiful, I had my binoculars and hung out on the front walk way to observe the clouds and sunset. I was curious to see if anything else was coming! And I couldn't believe what I saw! It was a long skinney shaped object, there were 4 lights in a row, glowing the same. Nothing blinking...just a steady glow and the object made no noise. It was heading west, I observed it through my binoculars several minutes until it left my site. The airport is southwest from here, it was not quite heading that direction. I have never seen this shape in person but have seen similar looking objects on UFO footage. I can't wait for my next encounter! Next time...I will have the video camera charged and ready to go !!!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"12/15/2011 07:39 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oklahoma","Object Shape":"Cigar","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.730365,+-97.43687(34042)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34042) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.730365","Case Number":"34042","Date of the Event":"12/15/2011 05:20 UTC","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Edmond","There were no other sightings in Edmond on or around December 15th 2011"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Approximently 2 min after witnessing the comet","Log Number":"US-12152011-0015","City":"Edmond","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34042.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34042.html"]}
