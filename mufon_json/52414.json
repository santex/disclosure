We were both looking at sky, and without talking with each other we watched this white light come out of now where in the sky, faster than anything i have ever seen, it swooped in a straight line out of darkness and stopped, almost if it was looking at us. I remember distantly looking at my watch right before @ 2:05 AM and once we observed the UFO leave orbit. it Was 4:30AM and my friends mother open the window to the house to yell at us for being so pound. So it from the fastest thing i have ever seen, to a dead stop, then lost over 2 hours, and accelerated as fast as it stopped and left. We both looked at each other after his mother yelled at us through the window, looking at each other and talking over what we had just seen, and questioning the fact of the lost time. While we are now both believers we rarely tell people about what we saw because, we already learned that the story doesn't earn any credit, and we get shunned for believing. But we also dont speak much about it becuase we dont know what happened. Why did we loose time, as far as we know we were silent the entire time before his mother opened her bedroom window to yell at us. since that day, i have been unable to think the same way, do the same things, an my previous medical problems seemed to worsen. i have seen very similar sightings more and more and choose to kepp quiet, as to not be outcasted but as crazy as it sounds, i feel like they come every so often, and make their presence known. its starting to worry me, as if they are keeping tabs on me"],"Date of the Event":"06/23/2008 02:05 UTC","Summary":"a friend and i were sitting on bench saw the sighting, came into atmosphere stopped hovered, and left.
