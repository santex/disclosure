AND I REALIZED THAT THE WERE CLOSER TO THE GROUND THEN STARS FAR AWAY. AT FIRST THEY JUST SAT THERE THEN THE GREEN ONE TOOK OFF REALY FAST, FASTER THEN ANY PLANE OR ROCKETT THAT HAVE EVER SEEN. AND THE BLUE ONE CAUGHT UP WITH IT JUST AS FAST. AND THEN THEY KINDA DANCED AROUND EACH OTHER FOR 5 TO 6 SECONDS AND SHOT OFF ABOVE THE TREE LINE. AND THAT WAS THE LAST I SAW THEM. I SLAPED MY BROTHER ON THE LEG AND SAID DID YOU SEE THAT. HE WAS LIKE YEAH, I SAW THE WHOLE THING. THEY LOOKED LIKE ORBS OR BALLS OF LIGHT. BUT THEY WHERE VERY DISTINCTIVE OF EACH OTHER.
