I also observed that there were acouple of airplanes flying at that time. Both airplanes seems to be flyinghigher than the green object and flew much more slowly that the object. Theaircraft had the typical white and red flashing lights. The bright green ballof light was flying approximately 3 times faster than the airplanes and had noflashing lights. It had no tail like a meteor or commet would have and it hadno trailing lights like a spot light. It was simple a solid green ball of lightflying very straight from the West side of I-5 highway to the East side, where Itook the Woodburn exit offramp to my house. The object moved rather quickly, soby the time I approached the Woodburn exit, the object was already out of mysight. Any one else see anything near Woodburn, Hubbard, Gervais Oregon around530pmThank you."],"Latitude":"45.143731","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2657.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2657.html"]}
