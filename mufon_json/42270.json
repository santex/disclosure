Object was black cigar-shaped with a white vapor ring around it. The vapor had a short tail trailing behind which evaporated very quickly unlike a jet's vapor trail. Object appeared to be about 10-12,000 ft. in the air. Its speed was like that of an aircraft on approach to an airport but it maintained a level course and never descended. Thought the object might be an asteroid or meteor. No brightness, flames or debris being emitted. There was a bright blue sky with no clouds anywhere and no other aircraft were in the vicinity. Checked the time on the car clock at 10:50am. Exited onto McCaslin Blvd. heading west and continued to observe the object which gradually turned southwest. Could still see object moving away in the distance as I turned south. Lost sight of it shortly after driving among houses in the subdivision. Had feelings of amazement and puzzlement at what this was. First reported it that same evening as a meteor on the American Meteor Society website. A few days later received an email from Tokyo that my description could not be a meteor. Only later did I come to the conclusion it might have been a UFO. I am very familiar with many types of aircraft and it was unlike anything I had ever seen. Entered a report on the UFO Evidence website in July."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Superior","There were no other sightings in Superior on or around December 24th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42270.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42270.html"]}
