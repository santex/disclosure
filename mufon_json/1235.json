I looked up to the NE5Ba habit since Im an amature astronomer and a former private pilot5D I saw two silvery dots in the sky. First I thaught they were high flyinggulls. But they did not move. I got my 80mm telescope that was in the garage.After fumbleing around with the scope I was able to get one of the objects inthe field of view. It turned out to be two brite silvery ball shaped objectsclose together. At that time I told my daughter to keep an I on them and I wentin to get my video camera. I was able to get one of the objects on tape for acouple of seconds before a cloud moved in and covered the objects. The tape isnot that good. It was vary sunny and hard to focus. Two hours later5B6:30pm5D when the clouds moved off I breifly saw one of the ojects in the same exactlocation. It then faded out."]}
