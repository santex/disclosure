{"Region":"Arizona","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving one of my usual routes from California to the Phoenix Arizona area on Interstate 10. I had plenty of daylight still and saw a bright light low on the horizon about 5-10 miles directly east of me.Curios why any aircraft would have their headlamps on and realized from passing by several California and Arizona airports at various times of day and night this wasn't a usual size and brightness. As the craft and all on the Interstate got closer it was a disc shaped, but was huge, probably 300 feet across, the edge was about 10 feet tall and sloped slightly towards the middle where it could have an estimated height of 20 feet at its center. The CB radios started clamoring \"Did you see that, The thing was huge. We are being invaded\""],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.45914,+-112.306909(49161)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49161) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49161.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49161.html"],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Date Submitted":"07/24/2013 08:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/10/2006 06:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-112.306909","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Avondale","Case Number":"49161","Log Number":"US-07242013-0019","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Avondale","There were no other sightings in Avondale on or around September 10th 2006"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Driving a load of refrigerated product to Pheonix AZ and noticed a shiny object about 5 miles east.
