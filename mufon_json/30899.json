{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMyself and 3 other friends were outside on the porch when I laid down on the concrete to look up at the sky. I was relaxing, watching the planes go by when suddenly this white ball shaped UFO flys in from the left to right. It was right above our house!!! It started doing mini circles in clockwise and counter-clockwise circle motions. Very much like wax on, wax off. We all saw it. Then it paused. I shit you not, it literally felt like it was onto us. when suddenly it vanished. We are completely blown away. I yelled out into the air, I JUST SAW A UFO!! WTF WAS THAT?!?! It was a dream come true. There is a little more to story. If anyone would like to meet us at the location, we are all willing to interview."],"Region":"California","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Downey","There were no other sightings in Downey on or around August 14th 2011"],"Summary":"White Ball UFO spins clockwise then counter-clockwise, stops and vanishes","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30899.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30899.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","City":"Downey","Date of the Event":"08/14/2011 10:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/14/2011 05:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-118.130869","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.943544,+-118.130869(30899)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30899) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"30899","Log Number":"US-08142011-0010","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Latitude":"33.943544"}
