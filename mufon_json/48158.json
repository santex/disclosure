We saw an orange ball of fire moving swiftly through the sky in an eastern direction. Behind it, in varying numbers (from 5 or so to 1) followed in same flight pattern. There was no noise, no change of direction. I taped the event on my iPhone. A woman and a man pulled next to our car and asked what were the objects in the sky, and we said we didn't know. (However, we did see two of these identical objects about three years ago in the sky in Brighton, NY, on Monroe Avenue, ) We observed the objects for about 5 minutes. There were about 12 of them, moving at the same pace, When the last one flew over, we tried to follow them in the car, but we couldn't find any of them."],"Longitude":"-77.375147","Log Number":"US-06162013-0002","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/15/2013 12:00 UTC"}
