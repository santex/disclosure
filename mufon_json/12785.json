There were so many stars out. I could see both the big dipper and little dipper. It was a very clear morning. Then I notice 2 identical stars close to each other that were extremely bright. I thought to myself that I had never seen those stars before. As I continued to watch, they both began to fade until they were gone. I thought maybe cloud cover was the problem, but none of the other stars faded. The sky was almost cloudless. It left me feeling extremely curious about what these were."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Knoxville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.966408,+-83.912839(12785)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12785) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"12785","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/26/2008 06:20 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.966408","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12785.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12785.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Tennessee","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
