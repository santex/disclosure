I was in my kitchen and I walked by the window,the window in the kitchen looks out over the backyard and the neighbors backyard. I had to do a double take and look back and what I saw really puzzled me. About 40-50 yards away in the neighbor backyard there was a sphere. It was floating about 7 feet off the ground and it was about 5 feet tall and wide. It hovered just under a tree. It was perfectly round, the inside looked like the inside of a plasma ball. But what really puzzled me about the whole thing was it had a weird eerie purple glow to it. It did not move it just floated there in mid air, for about 2 minutes. The kitchen was silent and the window was open and from what I could tell it was not making any noise. Slowly it started to get smaller and shrink with in its self, it took a matter of 30 seconds to completely disappear."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Vinton"}
