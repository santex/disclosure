I am still very reluctant and incase you think I am crazy I am not going to use my real name, but just call me George. I was living in the metro area of Portland OR. I was driving to work on a rainy morning in late winter or early spring of 1996. My wife was also riding in the passenger seat, sleeping. It was about 7:30am, it was daylight out and I was headed west bound on I-84, very close to the I-5 Jct. There is a point at the end of 84, where you can see the Portland sky-line on the other side of the Willamette River. I was at this point that I saw the most unbelievable thing. Something was flying very, very low over the river. But the most incredible thing was (this is not a hallucination), I could see through the thing. It was like when you take a very clear but detailed glass, flip it upside down and then run water over it, because of how the water spills over the glass you can see the shape of the glass. Only everything within that water covered shape is a bit blurry. This is what the rain did to the shape. I could see above the shape. I could see below the shape (till I got closer on 84). And I could see a bit blurred or distorted image through the shape. And the shape was not a disc or triangle. It had distinguishable layers or decks, parallel to the ground, and those decks were broken up into projected portions off set from each other. But the whole thing was like an elongated football, with the back end a little flat compared to the front. The object was moving over the Willamette from the south to the north. As I said I was moving down 84, and just past the Lloyd center exit, 84 begins to dip down, and there is where I began to see it. At this point, 84 is in a small ravine. So as I can see the skyline, this object is coming into view from the left side of the ravine. I kept watching it and trying to get my wife awake. It moves in front of me and it is so big I can���t see it all in the opening of the ravine. I had to wait till the front part was past the right side of the ravine, to see its end. I know it was much bigger then any thing I had ever seen by then or since. I kept listening for several days to the news to see if any one else had seen it. I heard no mention of this thing. So there was no way I was going to say a thing. Not until recently, now that I realize 100's of other people have seen flying objects over the years, that they couldn���t explain, did I feel maybe I could share this. I guess you guys would probably call this a UFO."],"Region":"Oregon","Latitude":"45.529782","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"Object flying very low over Willamette River.","City":"Portland","Case Number":"15451","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15451.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15451.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"03/31/1996 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"03/31/1996 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-02122009-0008"}
