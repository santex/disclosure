I pulled off to the side of the road for a few minutes and watched it. It appeared to be hanging right over another friends house, who lives at approx. 700 W and 300 N in Tipton County. It appeared to be below approximately 2500 feet in elevation, at about a 30% angle from the horizon. It was VERY bright. Brighter that even any landing lights I have see aimed directly at me. I immediately knew this wasn't a conventional aircraft. The light was a distinct orange color. There was a LARGE chevron shaped object DIRECTLY above the OBOL. I mean they could almost touch they were so close. And there were \"rays\" for lack of a better description, radiating from the chevron to the OBOL. IT was REALLY fantastic to see. I watched for approx 5 minutes. It never moved. It didn't go up, or down or come closer to me or retreat from me. I finally decided I had to get to my original destination so I left. When I returned to the area a few hours later, it was gone. There was no sound to the craft at all. Weather conditions were as follows: 24��� (-4��� C), wind E 10MPH Barometer 30.04, Dewpoint 16��� (-9���C), Wind Chill 15��� (-9���C) VISIBILITY 10.0 MILES. The Crescent Waning Moon was just above the area of the sighting in the western sky at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon. It was partially hazed over with a high altitude skud deck that was moving in. I felt very excited when I saw this. My first instict was that this was not anything conventional nor was it any known celestial object. The color was that DISTINCT OBOL orange from March and April of last year. There is NOTHING in the sky that color."],"Summary":"Bright orange OBOL with orange chevron above it radiating beams and pulsating.","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.492077,+-86.129943(14715)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14715) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01032009-0007"}
