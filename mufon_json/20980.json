It was a very clear sky, and I noticed a vertical, cigar shaped, cylindrical object that was very bright. It looked white to the naked eye. I followed it while driving, and then took three pictures with my iphone. Upon review, I got a good shot with one of the pictures, and it looks like two objects in the picture. There was an airplane close by, and with that reference point I was very convinced that this was not an aircraft of any kind. The moon was also in the sky, as it was such a clear bright morning, and only around 9-9:30am. Attached is the picture of what I saw. You need to zoom a little up and to the right of the trees in order to see the two objects, one on top of the other with a bit of space inbetween."],"Date Submitted":"12/13/2009 03:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"47.687638","Summary":"I saw a vertical, cigar like object brightly shining in the clear sky.
