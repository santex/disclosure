{"City":"Coeur d'Alene","Latitude":"47.686633","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details I was outside skywatching and looking to the southeast area at the right moment, I saw 4 bright white flashes in a row about 1 sec. apart. immediately following the last flash, the other object flashed 2 times with the same intensity and color as the first object. It appeared the first object was leading and the second was to the left 4 inches looking arms length to my finger and either lower or back futher away 3 or 4 inches. nothing else was seen. One half hour later, I saw a single flash just like the one earlier directly over my head, 3 secs later, it flashed once again, but had moved such a great distance so fast, and was right above the Mountian next to Rathdrum Mt. then it appeared to set down on the top and glow a white light for about 15 mins. along with one now glowing the same way on Rathdrum Mt. both lights faded out of my sight and nothing else seen. I have already filed with a local field investigator."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:08","Summary":"Objects not visable","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-116.773376","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.686633,+-116.773376(11414)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11414) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11414.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11414.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/26/2008 10:40 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07042008-0002","Case Number":"11414","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Coeur d'Alene","There were no other sightings in Coeur d'Alene on or around June 26th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"06/26/2008 10:40 UTC","Region":"Idaho"}
