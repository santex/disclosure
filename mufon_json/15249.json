{"Case Number":"15249","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn January 29th about 6 P.M. I was taking pictures of the Queen Mary. Later that evening I downloaded my pictures off my digital camera and then I realized there were 4 oval lights in one of my photos. My camera was on a long exposure and has exagerated the lights a little but yet these lights do not seem to be a reflection of any other lights in the area. My friends have reviewed the photo but no one seems to have an explanation. * I am submitting my photo to you. Would you please inform me of your thoughts? * If you need a better quality i can send it too. This is half the quality jpg puts out."],"Log Number":"US-02012009-0011","City":"Long Beach","Date of the Event":"01/29/2009 06:47 UTC","Summary":"4 oval lights in the sky above the Queen Mary in the LA Harbor.","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15249.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15249_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15249.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-118.154356","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/29/2009 06:47 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.810147,+-118.154356(15249)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15249) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.810147","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Oval","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Long Beach","There were no other sightings in Long Beach on or around January 29th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
