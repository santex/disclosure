{"Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/18/2008 08:50 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was filming the moon on Feb 18th. I was pointed east and the UFO flew from the south to the north right into my viewfinder. It was travelling very fast, so fast I did not have to time to react to try continuing tracking it on video. I had no doubt it is an ET craft from the first when I saw it fly by and then later looking at the video. I was pretty amazed to see it although I have several others on video. This one seems to be very large and disc or cylinder shaped. It appears to fly behind the moon but I am not 100% percent sure about that. I am about 11 miles from a DFW airport so this has to be close to their airspace."],"Log Number":"US-02192008-0006","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.824782","Object Shape":"Disc","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Hurst","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.824782,+-97.166668(9642)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9642) map </A>","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Hurst","There were no other sightings in Hurst on or around February 18th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"ufo flew by the moon","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-97.166668","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9642.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9642.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/18/2008 08:50 UTC","Case Number":"9642"}
