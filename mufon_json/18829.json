{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile driving southbound on North 83rd St, just south of Yellowstone Rd, my husband and I both saw a strobe type light blinking. It initally appeared to me to be eastbound in the vicinity of Woodland Rd. It then became clear that it was headed toward us, at approximately treetop level (20-30 ft above the ground). As we were traveling southbound, it passed us on the east going north above an empty field. The strobe pattern was a 2 out of 3 type pattern, 1-2-off,1-2-off. The light was very bright, making it impossible to tell size or distance. Initially I thought the light was the side of the light bar on a Sheriff vehicle or ambulance going east on Woodland Rd. My husband thought it was a warning light on a tower, although there are no radio towers in that direction. As the direction changed, and it came toward us, we both realized that we didn't know what it was."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.176557,+-105.095748(18829)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18829) map </A>","Object Shape":"Flash","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18829.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18829.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-105.095748","Latitude":"40.176557","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Longmont","There were no other sightings in Longmont on or around August 21st 2009"],"Date Submitted":"08/21/2009 11:30 UTC","Region":"Colorado","City":"Longmont","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Strobe type light traveling north at treetop level","Date of the Event":"08/21/2009 11:30 UTC","Case Number":"18829","Log Number":"US-08232009-0006","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City"}
