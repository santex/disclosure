Object(s) traveled straight-line paralleling Rt. 159 through St. Clair County. Object was dark and non-reflective. No lights or sound. I witnessed it only because the sky toward the horizon was lighter due to street lights and object was darker. Object appeared as three squares of unknown thickness configured as in the shape of a boomerang. Unable to determine elevation, but object was big enough or close enough that I could make out the three distinct sections. Object continued on until out of sight over a line of trees."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Appeared as 3 squares together in the shape of a boomerang.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37367.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37367.html"],"Log Number":"US-04112012-0005","Date of the Event":"04/10/2012 11:55 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","City":"Swansea","Longitude":"-89.983754","Latitude":"38.543389","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Swansea","There were no other sightings in Swansea on or around April 10th 2012"]}
