approximately 300' across and shaped similar to a football lying on its side, but had a deck or something like that about 1\\3 of the way up from the bottom of the craft. it emitted a brilliant white light from the entirety of the craft, but as bright as the object was, it did not illuminate the trees, the ground, or anything else it hovered over or near. having had the opportunity to see a grounded blimp up close and in person on a couple of occasions at peachtree dekalb airport in metro atlanta, i realized right away that what i was witnessing (a) was not a blimp or any other type of known non-rigid air ship, and (b) this craft had no visible cockpit, tail, rudders, windows, engines or wings. i would estimate that it was at least 1.5x to 2x the size of the average blimp, and again a bright crystal white light emanated from the entire body of the craft, not just a single point. additionally, there were no flashing lights anywhere on the craft. for about the next 45 minutes or so, we followed the craft, which would speed up and dart off, then slow down at will, often times just hovering motionless. during our chase, we came across other cars that had stopped along the side of the road to watch the object. finally, we sat on a road that i cannot remember the name of, but approximately 10 ~ 12 miles south of our original sighting point, we watched the craft hover over the road in front of us for about 90 seconds, and then begin coming towards us. my wife, who was already scared by what we were seeing, began to panic, and my son began crying, so we turned the car around and headed on to our original destination, which was my father���s house in new zion. we lost sight of the craft shortly thereafter. before this incident, i was a staunch non-believer, but having an encounter this close up, changed my mind forever. after telling family and friends of what we witnessed, most told us we were crazy, but my wife���s mother tell us that the next day she heard a story on abc news that a large and very bright ufo had been spotted that sunday up and down the eastern seaboard. i have never been able to confirm this report, but did find a fellow employee at my company who saw it as well, but from about 20 miles away. to this day, i really want to know what i saw, and have even considered hypnosis on a few occasions to see if i can enhance my memory of that night."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-79.755452","Log Number":"US-12082008-0001","Latitude":"34.199993","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"11/17/1996 07:00 UTC","Case Number":"14293","Date Submitted":"11/17/1996 07:00 UTC","City":"Florence","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
