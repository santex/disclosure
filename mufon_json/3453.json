I noticed a large speck in the sky on one shot. Using a computer to enlarge the area by 1000% I can see it appears to have a flat bottom and top of different circumferences. The left side of the narrower upper section appears to either be reflecting or emmitting light. The object does not appear on the next photo, which was taken less than two minutes later. I was facing Southeast from the north bank of the Schkulkill River, near the Art Museum. The building is across the river. I didn t notice the object when I took the photo or when first reviewing them. There are no other similar objects on any other photos."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3453","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Philadelphia","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Summary":"Not Provided","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3453.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3453.html"],"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/07/2005 06:46 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
