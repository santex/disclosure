{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailsafter parking my car my friend matt and i were heading back to the upper dorms at oit. we were previously admiring the planet venus as the sun set over the horizon but as we turned around a very noticeably bright white\\pale blue object could be see \"hanging\" in the air. it slowly started moving east in an almost(lazy) serpentine fashion and eventually flew over some hills behind the dorms. my friend said it looked very large (and with two light sources from each tip) from his perspective, and that it looked as if it were two smaller objects that merged into one, but all i could make out was an extremely bright orb.
