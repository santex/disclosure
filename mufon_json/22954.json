Then I realized it kept beeping and it was not the smoke detector beeping. I sat up quickly facing my bedroom door opening. It was pitch black and could not see past my bead room door, it sounded exactly like my treadmill when it is turned on and buttons are pushed to change the settings. I could not figure out why someone would be messing with my treadmill in the middle of the night. I could feel that someone was in my house. Then I thought it was little grey aliens, for some reason it really scared me. I wanted to get up to investigate, but was frozen from fear. I had a baseball bat that I wanted to grab in the corner of my room. I was also thinking of calling the cops. My treadmill was just around the corner of my room in the living room. I can���t remember if I am envisioning this or I saw them but I keep seeing these small bluish grey aliens, 2 or 3. Not clearly lit up like I was shining a light on them and they were standing at my bedroom door way. I remember looking outside my window at one point at the sky and it was a lot darker than normal as if there was a craft blocking the city lights. I do not recall seeing a space ship. I do recall that there was no other noise and it was eerily quite outside except for the noises coming from inside from my treadmill, about 3-4 minutes passed with my treadmill beeping. I had a bad feeling and my adrenaline was pumping hard. The next thing I see is a bright white type of light like lightning with a bluish color, it looked like electrical light. Much brighter than a light bulb and the light had a glow to it almost as bright as observing someone welding. It was shining on my wall at a strange angle it did not completely light up the entire wall, the light was coming from my formal living room where my treadmill was. When I saw this I knew that I had to investigate the light. Then a very strange sound stated, I could hear an electrical sound building up and a surge of power, then a loud sound like something left and shot off and something electrical blew up all close the same time. The light lasted about 3-4 seconds before the loud bang from the electrical sound, then the light vanished. Out of the corner of my eye my blinds were open to my window facing north, I never saw any light coming from outside. When the light went out I immediately looked outside and up to the sky. It still appeared eerie dark and could not see any stars or the glow from the city lights. My first feeling was that something teleported out of my living room and then a ship shot off. Second thought sounded like something electrical blew up. Not sure if something flashed by or left, I grabbed my cell phone and baseball bat. I used the phones light to see me way to turn on the first light. Not sure if it was the bathroom or hallway light that I turned on first. I remember banging my baseball bat on the tile floor to make some noise as I went through the house. Before I go the light turned on I had a strong feeling that I was going to see the small grey aliens. I grabbed my flashlight out of the laundry room and then immediately looked in the formal room and saw nothing. Another note I smelled nothing out of the ordinary, electrical burnt or from lightning. I inspected the whole house turned on all the lights. Was thinking about looking outside had a bad feeling not to go outside. I kept hearing something up in my attic or on the roof almost like footsteps. It was really freaking me out. I was hoping to find a window or door open, everything was locked and closed. I would have herd if a person had left my house. When I was going around the house I kept hearing scurrying noises inside and on the roof or attic. The whole time I was searching the house the aliens kept coming into my mind. I could sense something was still there, wanted to look on the roof and in the attic, decided that it was not a good idea. I could sense or feel a presence and that I was being watched. I did also notice that my refrigerator was showing that the power was off for 4 minutes from 3:06 Am to 3:10 (corrected). So while I was asleep my power went off just before this event. Around 4:20 am when I finally got back in bed with all the lights off, the city glow was back, so it appears that a ship was hovering over my backyard blocking out the cities glow from the lights. My thoughts for some reason when I started searching my house I was looking for grey aliens about 3.5 feet tall. They keep coming into my mind. I have always wanted to meet aliens, but for some reason I was extremely scarred, not sure why. The light and sounds from the electrical noise cannot be explained. The source of the light and the angle that it casted on my wall emanated about 2.5 ��� 3 feet off the ground in the middle of my formal living room. I have no sources of electrical items plugged in that could have emanated the light and sound. If my treadmill had started glowing it was in the wrong location. My treadmill works fine and I have not found anything that has signs of the electrical activity going on in my living room. I do not feel that they abducted me but, I keep having strange thoughts of seeing them and that I knew what I was looking for. I felt that they just came in my home and left. Does not make any sense, I am starting to think that I am being abducted and have been the first night I saw the light, because of how out of nowhere I have a strong sense of fear for no apparent reason, like my subconscious is reacting to what has been going on to me. At various times at night about the time I go to bed I have a sudden sense of fear the hairs stand up on my neck and my back starts to tense up, like I am being watched and I have a strong feeling that I do not want them to take me. The entire night that I am trying to sleep I am almost paralized from fear. I am now scarred when I go to bed, like they are waiting for me to fall asleep, to come and get me this has been going on the following nights from 4-16- 2010 to 4-21-2010. The fear is so bad at night, I do not even want to get up at night to go the bathroom 10 feet away. I would love to meet aliens, but not in this manner."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"04/25/2010 12:25 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash, Other, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Case Number":"22954","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22954.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22954.html"],"Region":"Arizona","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.3157,+-111.83545(22954)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22954) map </A>","Summary":"Visit from 3 Greys in home Teleporting","Latitude":"33.3157","Longitude":"-111.83545","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-04252010-0001"}
