I looked up to see a bird fly by and noticed a very bright star object way way way high up. I had everyone looking at it and watching it on and off for about 30 mins ( 6 witnesses). It slowly moved toward the northwest from my house. At arms length it was the size of a bright star at night. Bright white. Very high altitude. I looked at it throught the binoculars, and only saw a bright completely round circle. After all the excitement was over, the neighbor boy spotted it again way over the mountains northeast, this time, and it was blinking. Again we watched on and off for 20-30 minutes until it finally faded away. Same size as the other one and color, but flashing on off, on off. I always look to the sky to see cool stuff. I have seen other UFO's in the past that I will post here also. We are in the path of the airport, planes landing all day, and I will say we all agreed it was not an airplane."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
