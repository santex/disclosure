At about 45 degrees above the horizon and due north I noted a 'point of light that I assumed to be a star' that brightened to about minus forth magnitude and was moving from its initial position at about 10 degrees east of polaris,in a strait line at a constant velocity towards the east about 45 degrees above the horizon. I estimate the altitude at above 30 thousand feet. As it traveled, it dimmed to a magnitude of less than 1.0 and it moved at a constant speed and heading.
