{"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06072011-0011","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:11:00","Latitude":"35.005317","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had taken the dogs outside to do their business, and my Olde English Bulldogge, who has only barked twice in a year and is a VERY quiet dog, started to whimper and try to hide behind me, staring off to the north. I look and there, at about approximately 2 Oclock position in the northern sky, is a VERY bright white light, with about 4 red lights coming off from it. I thought it was a plane but after watching it for about 7 minutes, I realized it was just hanging there. I took 3 steps forward towards it, and it started to move towards me. Roughly 11 minutes after I initially spotted it, it flashed REALLY brightly, all the lights, and took off straight towards me, heading south. It passed over myself and 3 dogs, my home, at maybe 600 feet, absolutely silent, and HUGE. It passed over me, and sped up, blinking out of sight in a matter of moments after passing"],"Region":"Tennessee","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29444.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29444.html"],"Object Shape":"Chevron","City":"East Ridge","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-85.2303","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in East Ridge","There were no other sightings in East Ridge on or around June 6th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"06/07/2011 06:16 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"29444","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/06/2011 02:28 UTC","Summary":"Very bright and quiet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.005317,+-85.2303(29444)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29444) map </A>"}
