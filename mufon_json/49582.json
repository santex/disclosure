I had seen the same type of craft last week and weeks before that in the same direction. The craft shot up into the sky, hovered around, changed colors, turned the lights off, turned them on again, and then fell into treetops. Then a few minutes later it did the same thing. I recorded the scene the best that I could with my camera and iPad."],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","City":"Culver City","Case Number":"49582","Summary":"Colorful ufo seen in West La, shooting up into sky, falling, disappearing again and again","Latitude":"34.00123","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49582.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49582.html"],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Culver City","There were no other sightings in Culver City on or around August 6th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"N/A","Date of the Event":"08/06/2013 08:30 UTC","Longitude":"-118.428104","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
