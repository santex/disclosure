She was finishing a cigarette before we went inside. Neither of us were really talking or doing anything in particular. The radio was on, she was fiddling with something and I was watching the our dog walk around the yard. For some strange and unknown reason we both looked up into the sky at the same place and same time and both said at the same time, \"What the f*** is that?\" It was a bright white light, almost blue but not quite, that was coming up from behind the tree line. The light was about twice the size of Venus and I would estimate it to be quite a ways away, at least a mile or so. The light ascended straight up for about 5 seconds, slightly veered to the right and started to dim, and within another 5 seconds there was no light. It quickly faded away. We were very excited about it, not afraid or freaked out."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bullard","There were no other sightings in Bullard on or around February 6th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Case Number":"35545","Country":"United States","Latitude":"32.14441","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.14441,+-95.319009(35545)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35545) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.319009","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35545.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35545.html"]}
