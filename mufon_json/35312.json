{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"31.974359","Summary":"Shiny white object like other stars in sky rapidly descended vertically for ~1sec then vanished","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":[],"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn January 26 2012 my friend and I drove from our home in Arlington to the outlet mall in Allen Texas. I don't remember exactly what time we arrived. We get out of the car and begin walking passed the stores (its an outlet mall so therefore we're walking outdoors). It's a fairly clear night sky with a few stars (around 5 to 7) in sight, After just 30 seconds to a minute of walking, at approximately 6:20 PM (it could have been 15 minutes earlier or later, I don't remember the exact time) I see what looks just like a small white star, appearing no different from the others in the sky, descend rapidly (from about 70 degrees to 30 degrees in sight). It did not \"fall\", It shot down extremely fast, perfectly vertically. At about 30 degrees it vanished, just disappeared out of thin air. No flash. The whole experience lasted a second or less. My friend was not looking in the sky and didn't notice. My first reaction was to tell her. I was in shock and disbelief at what I had just witnessed, it was unlike anything I had seen before or thought possible. It seemed unreal."],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"01/26/2012 06:20 UTC","Case Number":"35312","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35312.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35312.html"],"Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-01282012-0013","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/28/2012 04:27 UTC","Longitude":"-99.897873","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.974359,+-99.897873(35312)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35312) map </A>"}
