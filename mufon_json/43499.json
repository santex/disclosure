Female witness was out walking a dog at 8:00 p.m., Sunday, October 21, 2012, a couple blocks from her residence in Des Moines, IA, when she saw two yellow-orange objects, which she calls orbs, moving from SSE to NNW. Witness believes objects were moving FASTER than a typical light plane speed, and they remained same distance apart as they moved. She believes objects were at about 80 degrees elevation, and that they were close to her, perhaps no more than one-eighth mile land distance. Weather data shows OVERCAST at 4200 feet. After an estimated 3 minutes, the first object disappeared into a cloud. Soon after, the second object also encountered a cloud and disappeared. Witness was thrilled by the sighting, and ran, dragging the dog along to get a better view of the objects."],"Log Number":"US-10242012-0009","Source":"MUFON","City":"Des Moines","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Two yellow-orange objects below overcast moving SSE to NNW 600-700 feet land distance","Region":"Iowa","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43499.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43499.html"]}
