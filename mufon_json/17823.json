It hung in one place for 30 secs and then moved across sky away from that place at a speed a little faster than a satellite moves. Then it moved bavk toward original area momentsrily and back and forth like this 4 or 5 times before shooting off skyward and away. It was a little brighter than a background star above it but larger in diameter. My initial momentary thought was that it was asatellite but then it maneuvered and I knew it wasn't. We both were watching the object and in awe. Needless to say, the fireworks themselves held iftle fascination after that."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-82.531018","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Algonac","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.618368,+-82.531018(17823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17823) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 10:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"White globe-like object hovered over fireworks.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Algonac","There were no other sightings in Algonac on or around July 4th 2009"]}
