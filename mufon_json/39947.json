The lights came into view as I turned right onto Gillham Rd at 43rd St. The lights were only visible for a few moments as the object was travelling east south east and was quickly obscured by the tree-lined horizon. The very short time I could see it, it appeared to have just changed direction toward the east south east. I could see the lights for only a few seconds after it was obscured by the trees, but for a second or two, I could still see the lights through the trees - but then it was gone."],"Log Number":"US-06302012-0010","Latitude":"39.049073","Longitude":"-94.578691","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"06/30/2012 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There was one other sighting in Kansas City on or around June 30th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Three turquoise colored lights at each corner of the triangle, very brief sighting obscured by trees on horizon.","City":"Kansas City","Case Number":"39947","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON"}
