I witnessed an object flying low and CRUISING,I mean this thing was FAST. I did not report it earlier because I wanted to see if there was something on the news about it. There wasn't. I was outside with my dog and from where I was facing, west, I witnessed an object come from the south heading north and flying very fast, faster then any plane I have seen. Yes there was planes in the sky that night also. I saw only one light, until it got to the north then it looked like a red and a few blue lights went on and it looked like the object was slowing down and or stopping."],"Summary":"Witnessed an object flying very fast at a low altitude.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22474.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22474.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/21/2010 09:05 UTC","Case Number":"22474"}
