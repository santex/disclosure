I'm not sure what made me look up onto the horizon. Immediately after I saw the object, I ran inside and grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look, but I still could not tell what the object was. From the angle I was seeing it, I can only describe it as a long cigar-shaped object with ends that curve downwards , or a saucer-shaped object rotating on a plane parallel to my angle of vision. It slowly lumbered across the starless night sky. I just kept thinking to my self \"that is something interesting.\" it wasn't until afterwards did I start to think that maybe that was a UFO. I finally lost sight after about five minutes when the object move too low in the sky for my to see. This happened five-six years ago so my details are little fuzzy."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Greensburg","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.307138,+-79.529549(28137)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28137) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
