At first I thought it was an airplane butbit wasn't moving. Then I thought it was a really tall cell tower but as I approached I didn't see the tower only the lights about 500 feet in the air. As I passed under them it looked a bit like the bottom of a plane except the only lights were on the outer tips and were white and the fact that it wasn't moving. Once I passed it I looked back a few times and I didn't move. Then I was out of sight."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.149116","Latitude":"36.06457","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"13141","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/09/2008 08:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Fayetteville","There were 3 other sightings in Fayetteville on or around October 9th 2008"],"Log Number":"US-10212008-0013","Date Submitted":"10/09/2008 08:10 UTC","Region":"Arkansas","Object Shape":"Cross","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13141.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13141.html"],"Summary":"was driving dow highway and see to white lights like the bottom of airplane bit did not move stayed about 500 feet above ground"}
