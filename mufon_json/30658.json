(object only took 15 sec. to cross the sky, verses 1-2 minutes like other aircraft at that altitude). Ten minutes later, the same object was observed traveling West on the same flight path. again, the same object was observed traveling East on the same flight path after another ten minutes. Viewed the object thru binoculars and observered no wings, windows, or engines on what could otherwise be mistaken for a jet flying in the distance. at 7:50pm, a black helicopter (blackhawk) with no markings flew over my neighborhood at less than 300 feet altitude also traveling East. the blackhawk was low enough to see the sidedoor open and crewmembers dressed in black swat type uniforms looking out the side door."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Louisiana"}
