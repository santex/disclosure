{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were on a bow hunting trip in the Uintah Mountains. We were clmbing up a steep grade(driving)where we were looking up at the stars for a few seconds. Noticed a very bright multicolored object coming down at a high rate of speed. During the descent it would produce a tail of lights swithing from red,green blue, yellow in rapid spurts. It came down even with the vehicle and stayed for 10 seconds and shot back out into space diappearing. The lights were too bright to distinguish a shape. I worked on fighter aircraft for several years and during this observation. This was not falling debris of some sort. It literally shot back outto space in a blink of an eye. Scared the hell out of me the rest of the trip."],"Summary":"Viewed brilliant muti-colored lights descending rapidly, stopped and shot back out to space.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.643007,+-111.280738(10672)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10672) map </A>","City":"Kamas","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Utah","Date of the Event":"08/27/1980 04:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.643007","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Kamas","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"10672","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10672.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10672.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10672.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/27/1980 04:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-111.280738","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05052008-0010"}
