(her young ears are better than my 40 year old ones, though). when my sister played back her ir daytime ufo video june 13, 2009, with the sound (on youtube channel: seeingufospa), she said that was the exact sound it made. then, she said, \"mom, it was the coolest thing...it had to have been a ufo! you got to stay up with me because i'm sure another one is going to fly by soon. i just know it will!\" she sat there with such excitement, like she had just drunk 3 energy drinks waiting for it to happen again, but it never came back and we fell asleep. when we told my sister the next day, she hugged and told my daughter, \"welcome to the ufo seer's club!\" she's estatic that someone else outside the immediate family was witness to a sighting. she's afraid people will think she's a kook and doesn't want to tell anyone about it. i have to admit, that before this, i had reservations about all the sightings my sister had told me about, not because she makes things up, but because i seemed so unbelievable that so many could be seen in one area. i haven't seen any yet in colorado, although your site lists several reports. i'm so jealous that i didn't get to see it. i will definately start looking at the skies with more regularity now."],"Weather Factors":"Rain, Light","Region":"Pennsylvania","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.436392,+-79.689065(18442)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18442) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18442.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18442.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/30/2009 11:00 UTC","Country":"United States"}
