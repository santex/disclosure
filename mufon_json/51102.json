The object was very visible,and very bright in the dark night sky.It was hovering when I first observed it. I then opened my screen door,and leaned out for a better look. At this point,it suddenly began to move,and still silent,moved in a straight line high above a row of trees,after which I could no longer see it.(as it flew silently away,it tipped a little to one side). It was a littlefrighteing because,it hovered until I opened the door,and leaned out,then began to move.I had the feeling I was being watched. I first noticed the object while in my living room.I caught a glimpse of it out my back door,and realized this wasn't a normal celestial body."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Lisle","There were no other sightings in Lisle on or around September 23rd 2013"],"Latitude":"41.769597","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"51102","Log Number":"US-09262013-0012"}
