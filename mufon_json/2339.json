I look up to gaze at the stars. One of themseems square and changing color. I watch and yes, it is changing color notblinking or twinkling but actually changing color. I go get my binoculars andyes, it is square, hovering and changing colors. Then other glowing objectssuddleny race and fly into it. I go get my mother and father who both see itthrough the binoculars and both see it go from blue to red to green to violetand continue changing color like that. I get a flashlight and aim the lightdirectly at it and the light blanks out other stars around it but this objectjust gets a little brighter. My reaction and thought is that it is a stationarymother ship however odd that sounds. I never lost sight of it, it is out thereright now, every night in the same position. Mabey a satellite Mabey just a starI dont think so. It chages colors like nothing else up there. Im going to borrowmy friends telescope to get a really good look at it."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
