Elliptical ring of orange flames coming from backside arranged neatly all the same length like a ring of bunsen burners or the flames on a gas stove. The bright white light at the nose remained while the flames shut off at the same time and started back one to two seconds later. Was traveling south west on 204 in Savannah, Georgia in front of Atlantic Armstrong State University. Traveling at a very fast rate. Object was large, it just appeared. News said it was probably space debris. I will never believe that unless I see it. Object went behind trees and out of sight."]}
