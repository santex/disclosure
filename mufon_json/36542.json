I went to get my camera and when I came out it appeared to be gone. I aimed my camera in the direction I saw it to take a picture just in case. As I was taking the picture I said to myself show yourself so I can take a picture. As I looked through the view finder to take the picture the object appeared from the north. After I took the picture and looked up it was gone again."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Spanaway","There was one other sighting in Spanaway on or around March 13th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/13/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Region":"Washington","Case Number":"36542","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-122.428036","Summary":"Witnessed bright light in sky.
