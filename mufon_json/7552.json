{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and i were playing on an old train bridge and started to clime to the top.As we were looking up we saw three lights high in the sky, and thought nothing of it.I thought it was a plane at first, but as it got closer it seemed to be dropping at a very fast rate...When it stopped it was about 100 meters from the top of the train bridge and had three lights, one on each end. It hovered there for about seven minutes and started drifting south..We got on our bike's and tried to follow, but it moved away very very fast.... I have never told anyone about this and as far as i know neither has my friend."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"7552","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Welland","There were no other sightings in Welland on or around June 10th 1994"],"Date of the Event":"06/10/1994 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-79.238165","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.000154,+-79.238165(7552)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7552) map </A>","Region":"Ontario","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7552.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7552.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Welland","Country":"Canada","Latitude":"43.000154","Summary":"I was only about 16 at the time and i witnessed a triangled shape UFO","Date Submitted":"06/10/1994 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"CA-07302007-0007","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
