Heard this strange noise in the sky, I looked up and seen 3 lights in a triangle shaped form the lights did not blink it was going in a straight line. I watched for a minute or two then yelled for my husband to come look. He came out and it was a little farther away but did see it. Then we seen another blinking light come toward it but nothing happened we think the blinking light was a plane but not sure what the triangle shaped thing I saw was. I do not believe in UFOS but I'm not sure what I saw. Then read online other people seen the same thing the same night I did."],"Log Number":"US-11202012-0008","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44053.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44053.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date of the Event":"11/16/2012 12:00 UTC","Summary":"3 triangle shaped light flew over","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.207312","Date Submitted":"11/20/2012 02:07 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":[],"Case Number":"44053","Country":"United States"}
