(i promise you i am not making this up)... then even more unbelievably, around 2 weeks ago, i had took my son back to his university accommodation and was getting some of his stuff out of my car to take into his room when i saw another one... and 'yes' it was exactly the same ! i saw it flying in a straight line again, and it just went up through the clouds and dissapeared i swear i am not making any of this up, and my son can confirm the first 2 sightings (he was inside his place for the 3rd and did not see it) i know what a plane and a helicopter look like at night... and they do not only have a (what would be very large) sole red light (which did not flash). i have been meaning to report it all since the last sighting, but did not know how to until i saw this facility on your site."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.751585,+-2.485739(21977)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21977) map </A>","Summary":"we observed 2 round red lights moving close to each other at the same speed in the same direction","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"10/31/2009 09:15 UTC","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"02/22/2010 12:40 UTC","Country":"United Kingdom","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Blackburn"}
