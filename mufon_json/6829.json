Myself, and one other person witnessed this same flying as we have for at least 4 years now. I will be submitting to you a more in debth explanation of our studies soon. In the mean time, any clear night, usually early on after dark, the light appears from any given direction and seems to be observing as it passes over. Then once passed, it's light dims to total darkness. At dark every evening I set out with several pair of binoculars and a friend and start watching the \"show\". I advise anyone to do the same. A person can see a lot in 4 years and I'm ready to talk to someone about it! God help me"],"Summary":"Silent orb of light passed directly overhead, light fades to darkness","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
