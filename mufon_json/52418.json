Noticed above my head 6 spherical objects moving north. Bottoms of objects is what I saw. Objects were copper colored with thin lines or thread like lines of gold intersecting on bottom of all spheres. 5 spheres moved in a very tight formation, at times seemed to touch or move into each other. 1 sphere moved along side of the 5 could have been a bit bigger than the 5 as a whole. Observed this for about 30 seconds or so. Objects did not move terribly fast but seemed to have a,\"controlled speed?\" No obvious light coming from any of them. Lit only, by I suppose light from surrounding houses and street lights. No sound at all coming from these objects. Objects faded into night sky. Wasn't scared, awed certainly. Have seen lots of UFOs around here, but this is the only one I have felt a need to report."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.684315","Date Submitted":"11/25/2013 11:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.684315,+-87.744787(52418)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52418) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"11/24/2013 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Illinois","City":"Alsip"}
