It even traveled over a commercial airline that did have blinking lights. It look like it was much higher. I thought it was strange that it didn't have blinking lights like the other plane, so I then started to think it wasn't a plane at all. It traveled to the east until I couldn't see it anymore over the trees. I see where someone in Minnesota and someone in Indiana seems to have seen the same thing."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.7929","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23051.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23051.html"],"Region":"Wisconsin","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/29/2010 09:30 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04302010-0016","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.7929,+-88.781098(23051)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23051) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/30/2010 03:09 UTC"}
