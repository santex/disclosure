I decided to bring my binoculars and tripod so I could do some star gazing as well. as I was setting up my wife near our garage asked me something, I looked up to the west and noticed a star like object that looked out of place. there are not alot of stars out in that direction where the magnitude is above a 1 or 2. The object was quite bright and stationary. In perhaps 5 seconds, brightened slightly And then faded out completely. The feel of the event was \"yep, that was something.\" I jumped online to see where the ISS was (Not even going over N.America presently), no space shuttle or satellites. The event was short but impressive. Event occured at 8:18pm Duration lasted about 5 seconds."],"Longitude":"-114.049246","Summary":"Looking to the West, object illuminated then disappeared","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-03242011-0001","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Kingman","There were no other sightings in Kingman on or around March 23rd 2011"],"City":"Kingman","Weather Factors":"None"}
