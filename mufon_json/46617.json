After that object climbed away from the canyon two more objects came from the same place the first one did. A total of 6 objects were sighted coming out of the canyon. I really am not sure what it was, if it were a helicopter it would've had to of been military. As the objects went to the north they just disappear, no more lights. I just thought it was pretty weird. I saw something way different about two weeks ago and now that I found this website I will have to post it."],"Region":"Utah","Log Number":"US-04052013-0020","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Ogden","There were no other sightings in Ogden on or around April 5th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"04/05/2013 09:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.180789,+-111.995385(46617)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46617) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Ogden"}
