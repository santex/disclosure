It was around 9 pm, clear sky with stars above. I was about to go into the car and happened to look up into the sky and saw an object, a light, possibly star-like moving in a horizontal line. It appeared out of nowhere and was traveling faster than a regular plane...I would estimate more than 700 mph but less than 3000 mph. The elevation is unknown but appeared to be about 1 mile up. The object appeared for several seconds then disappeared. I could not see it anywhere at all. I also did not see a tail which would indicate a comet or shooting star. I excitedly told my family who all came out of the car but we did not see anything else. We then left for our late night dinner appointment."]}
