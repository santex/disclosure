They have 4 or 5 stages set up around the Festival and bands are playing all the time. We had gone to see the band Los Lobos play and were sitting on the lawn to watch them. They had just finished playing and we both looked up at the sky because it was such a beautiful night. I caught my eye on what I thought was a balloon and pointed it out to my girlfriend. Then I realized it wasn't a baloon. It was traveling East and as it was traveling, it was zig zagging...real quick zig zags. I was mesmorized watching it and then it went behind a cloud. I looked at my girlfriend and without me saying anything, she says \"I think we just saw a UFO\". I started laughing because I was thinking the same thing. We waited for it to appear after the cloud moved but never saw it again."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/04/2009 09:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.645222,+-83.288307(19100)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19100) map </A>","Tags":"City","Summary":"Saw UFO over Pontiac Michigan.","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Pontiac","Longitude":"-83.288307","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"42.645222","Case Number":"19100","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/06/2009 08:45 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
