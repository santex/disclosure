The booster rockets are NOT what I seen, this thing was not any ways near the shuttle, where I seen this thing , I was at 6 Gun Shopping Plaza . And it went over head before the Shuttle had lifted off , in fact it seemed to have timed it self to be at the Launch site just as it lifted off . I was in my car , waiting on my wife to come out of the store , when I spotted this thing going over head and it made absolutely no sound and there was nothing sticking out on it and no wings or rudder or stabilizer also it was staying at the same altitude in a level flight pattern and it went right overhead . It looked like a big cylinder shaped tank with rounded caps on each end sort of like a bit larger than a railroad tanker and it moved slowly from West to East and it was probably in a line about 50 miles west of where the shuttle went up . I could not imagine what was keeping it up in the air ! As a matter of fact , right after this thing was out of site , is when the Shuttle went up , so NASA was surely aware of it's presents , if not , it's because they aren't saying they seen it . It looked like a Propane tank and it was painted a Barn red color and it was about 20 Ft. in diameter and about 40 or 50 Ft. long . Afterwards , just as the thing was going out of sight over the trees, my wife came out and I tried to get her to see the thing but it was too far away , but then the shuttle was going up in an arc toward the east and I didn't see the boosters drop off because it was too far away from my location in the old six gun plaza in Ocala. I guess no one seen what I did and Maxine (my wife) didn't see it either until it was way East of us but I seen it when it was almost overhead and watched it until it was out of site going in a strait line and at the same altitude at about 40 or 50 miles an hour. This took place about 4 or 5 PM in the afternoon on a clear day as the sun was going down in the West . SSSSooo , What was it ? This is my first sighting of a UFO and i am very curious if any other Ocala resident seen this thing ? It seems IMPOSIBLE for this thing to be up there and not have any visible means of being supported in the air ! I have checked other UFO sources and i don't find anyone seeing an object of this sort , so i am wondering if there is anyone out there that can corroborate my sighting ? I hope that I'm not the only one that seen this thing . P.S. File #2 is a picture of what this object looked like , it was VERY simular ."],"Date of the Event":"02/08/2001 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07162005-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.195499,+-82.132392(3594)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3594) map </A>","Case Number":"3594","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Ocala","There were no other sightings in Ocala on or around February 8th 2001","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Aproximately 10 X 20 Cyclinder Rounded at each end painted barn red","Longitude":"-82.132392","Region":"Florida"}
