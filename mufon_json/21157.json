It then seemed to move back into the night sky as the red started to disappear and the yellow got smaller until it completely disappeared. This was seen by my myself, my daughter and her friend. There was also a group of youths aged approx. 14yrs upwards who watched it. This is unlike anything I have ever seen before. kind regards lucie mackay"],"Log Number":"GB-12262009-0018","City":"Dundee","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Dundee","There were no other sightings in Dundee on or around December 26th 2009"],"Region":"Scotland"}
