{"Longitude":"-118.235405","Latitude":"34.059524","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/25/2010 11:19 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on the balcony and noticed an object in the sky that looked like a balloon but it was bright red. (the sun was setting) It appeared over Los Angeles City Hall and moved slowly in a north and westerly direction for several minutes. It was at one point directly overhead and seemed to be slowly turning in a circular motion where it sometimes looked like a cigar and other times like a \"V\". It appeared to have some kind of ���aurora��� around it. I took a picture when a plane crossed near it but all you can see is a speck of the plane but there is an odd ���orb��� about where the object was. Not the color red, but like a ���light spot��� in the picture. I will try to look closer at the picture but ultimately it does not show much of anything. After several minutes of watching it overhead my neck was sore from looking directly up. A few moments later I noticed it again rather far away based on its earlier speed of travel, very slow. It was in the far distance headed east. There were no lights on the object and as the sun was setting more it was obvious that the other air traffic had lights on. At that point I saw 2 military helicopters fly in the same general area and then several minutes later they hovered over LA city Hall, about the location of the initial sighting. (They do this on occasion for drills but the timing of this seemed too perfect). During the course of all this I noticed 2, possibly 3 commercial jets fly in the general area and one private plane. (The commercial jets do not usually take this flight path to my knowledge and I have lived where I live for 10 years). I am not sure what it was, not saying it was a UFO. First thought it was a balloon but after the timing of the military choppers and strange change in air traffic I though it might be good to report to see if anyone else saw anything. It would be interesting to hear if so! I prefer to remain unknown but you can reach me via email if you wish. PS I am not sending in the photograph as it does not seem to show anything but also would reveal my residence and I do not wish to do this."],"Country":"United States","City":"Los Angeles","Date of the Event":"04/25/2010 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Red object in sky over los angeles, shape unclear","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around April 25th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Blimp, Boomerang, Cigar, Chevron, Circle","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22969.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22969.html"],"Log Number":"US-04252010-0016","Case Number":"22969","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.059524,+-118.235405(22969)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22969) map </A>"}
