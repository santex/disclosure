The sky was hazy that night, and it was hard to see the stars, so it was really easy to notice this 'ball' of light. At first, I thought that maybe there was an accident and they had to fly in a helicopter and it had on its landing lights. But soon after driving closer to the object, I noticed this was not the case. The object was a very bright, orange in color and looked as if it was changing from orange to red. There was no sound, and the object seemed to be 'floating' or moving very slowly in an eastern direction. After following this object for about 10 minutes, I had to turn around and go back to where I was going to. This is amazing to me, and when I saw the video of the Stephensville sighting in Texas, that is exactly what I saw that night!!"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-83.523777"}
