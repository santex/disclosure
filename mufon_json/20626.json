There were no clouds in the sky and as I waited I was looking at the stars. I was facing Orion when I noticed movement between his belt and the horizon. I was facing approximately 100 to 105 degrees and they were 20 degrees above the horizon. There were five objects in close formation one slightly higher than the rest. The lower four seemed to be changing positions. The objects did not appear to be projecting any light. They did appear to be reflecting light. If there had only been one I would have of thought it was just a satellite, although I have never seen a satellite orbit in that direction. The formation was moving up and to the south. I then ran inside and got my wife out of bed and showed her the formation from the bedroom window. We both then went back outside and watched the formation continue until they faded away. The higher they got the less light appeared to reflect. The light steadily diminished and when we couldn���t see them anymore my wife went back inside. I then looked at my watch and it was 2145hrs. The start time was an estimate. as I stood there trying to get another glimps a meteor came across the sky from the east to south. I then called my uncle up in Utah and told him the story. I made the call at 2150hrs. It was a beutiful night to be looking up!"]}
