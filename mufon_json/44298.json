(this ascension took less than ten seconds) throughout the event the object was not close at all to us and i did not feel threatened in any way. my impression was that the object\\light was as far of the ground as as a small aircraft, but not as high as the jets that we have frequenting the area. of course i don't know how big the object was so that information is purely subjective. it had no flashing safety lights of any colour, the light it emanated was non-directional and did not appear to my eye to be electrical in nature."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.685703,+-121.799243(44298)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44298) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/02/2012 06:30 UTC","City":"Marina","Summary":"Very bright constant orange/red light moving over our car while we were driving.","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12022012-0017","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-121.799243","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/02/2012 11:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
