One light was brighter than two others. They were able to change abrupt the direction and were also able to stand till for a long time. They were able to fly \"zig-zag\" and were hunting each other for several hours. After they disappeared short before dawning. All this happened around the 11th of September 2013. First it looked like stars but nothing-nor plane, nor satelite can move and change directions so fast like this. We were amazed what we've seen and for sure we will remember this for the whole life."],"Date of the Event":"09/11/2013 12:00 UTC"}
