While we were on the floodwall that runs adjacent to Harrison Avenue in Old Clarksville, I notice an orange orb moving in an irregular pattern aproximately a half mile to three quarter mile north of my position. so I decided to watch it for a moment to see if it would burst like a fire work explosion, or fall and fade out like a flare, or just blink out. It didn't do any of those things. It moved oddly to the east, and then started on an upward angle toward the sky and dissapeared. When I got home I immediately told my wife what I'd seen, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably for about thirty seconds. I believe that to be due to the fact that whatever I'd seen wasn't a normal occurance and my mind was having diffuclty accepting the event. It will be the last time i ever leave my house at night with out my cell!"]}
