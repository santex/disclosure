THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE NOTICE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN THE PAST 16 YEARS I'VE BEEN AROUND. I WOULD LIKE YOU GUYS TO DETERMINE THE ALTITUDE AND THE SPEED OF THIS THING. I KNOW YOU ALWAYS DOUBLECHECK IF THE SCENE HAS BEEN ALTERED BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE, I DON'T WANT ANY PUBLICITY, I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF WE ARE DEALING WITH AN HOLOGRAM, WHICH I SUSPECT IT IS. ONCE I GET THE VIDEO DOWNLOADED TO A MPG OR AVI FORMAT I'LL SEND IT THIS THURSDAY.
