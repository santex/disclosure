As they were entering [their] car, 2 very bright red [orbs] came slowly from the WNW to the ESE, from my left side. I pointed up at them and said \"UFO's\" to my friends but because of the cold weather (approx. 32��� F). They did not look. Thinking I was joking, perhaps. They drove away without looking. When reports came out in the newspapers my friend called me on the phone to ask what I had seen. They [the objects] made no noise. There was no sign of heat waves. They were very stable objects even though there was a 20-30 MPH wind, as there was a norther blowing in at the time.\""],"Weather Factors":"Fog, Light","Tags":"City","City":"Stephenville","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-98.193703","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.221796,+-98.193703(9693)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9693) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02242008-0001"}
