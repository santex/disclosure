I had taken a whole series of camera shots with my cell phone camera, when I saw this object. The sun was already comming an can be seen in the frame. I waited to see if this was an airplane, but it was stationary and then simply started to back out of the picture and then suddenly dissapeared in an instant. It was not an airplane, because I can see and watch airplains from my deck go to an from the airport all the time and I've never seen the sun and the moon look like this at the same time in the same skyline."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-97.784008","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.368978,+-97.784008(33195)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33195) map </A>"}
