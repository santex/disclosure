My wife noticed a glowingcylinder-like object that was looming very high in the sky, not really movingmuch. It kept changing shapes, moving almost like a worm. Then it formed anarrow shape and made a few very quick moves, only to return to its originallocation and start the worm-like moves again. I watched for nearly 15 minutes,and kept wondering what it could possibly be. At first I thought it was a lostkite, but it was so big, and so high, and it held its position for so long Ididnt think it could be that. Plus, it was such a clear day and it was so high,I figured if it was kite or something like that, I would see the shiny materialrelfecting in the sun, but it held a constant glow, and didnt make anyreflections even when it moved. It HAD to be a UFO and I dont really believe inthem."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.189857,+-118.451357(2645)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2645) map </A>","Disposition":"Hoax","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.189857","City":"Los Angeles","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2645.html"],"Case Number":"2645"}
