Realized it was way too low and moving WAY too slowly to be an airplane. It was a large (about the size of a small house) triangular object, dark in color with red flashing lights at one corner and very bright white lights at all corners. The red lights appeared to flash sequencially, while the white lights were a bit random, and more steadily on. The object was moving so slowly it almost appeared to be stationary. Turned into the neighborhood and lost sight of it behind trees, when I rounded the corner to where I should have been able to see it again, I could not find it anywhere in the sky. The whole sighting lasted about 45 seconds, and my cell signal was slightly erratic when the object was visible."],"Latitude":"33.861868","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43446.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43446.html"],"Summary":"Large Slow moving triangular craft. bright white flashing lights.
