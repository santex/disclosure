It is quite warm, around 75 degrees, unseasonably hot for the time of year which is why we were on the porch. Suddenly my friend says \"what's that?\" His wife and I look in the direction he is looking and observe several objects (we thing around 6) flying extremely fast and making unbelievable maneuvers around each other. They were emanating different colored lights, which changed. They were quite close together for how fast they were going. The moves they made could not have been made by any known craft. We see a lot of sky traffic here on San Francisco Bay and know very well what they look and sound like. These objects do not conform to those descriptions. They made no sound at all. We were so stunned we didn't even have time to grab our cell phones to try to get video or pictures before they had zoomed away to the East (they came from the west, the direction of San Francisco). They either flew away very fast or cloaked themselves because in a matter of 10-15 seconds they were out of view. They were roughly following the electromagnetic \"BART\" tracks, our public transit high speed train. We live next to the tracks, one block away. I am going to try and draw them to submit to this report. I am exhausted at this point."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"11/06/2012 09:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.787271,+-122.289553(43752)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43752) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"43752"}
