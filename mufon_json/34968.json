No stars were visible. I noticed a formation of stars in the south moving northerly at a slow speed. As this formation of approximately 6 was passing directly overhead, the star on the left rear suddenly flew off to the left and went in counter clockwise manner completing a circle. I felt it noticed me and wanted to show itself. During this I noticed it turned dark gray and had short wings. When it was done it got back into formation and started glowing as a star. The formation kept moving north. I watched it until the formation went out of sight over the horizon. I heard soon afterwards that it was seen from the east side of Colorado Springs and that the formation was seen moving over the Rockies in a northerly direction."],"Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"34968","Object Features":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There was one other sighting in Colorado Springs on or around September 10th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.841264,+-104.828278(34968)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34968) map </A>"}
