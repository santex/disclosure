{"City":"Kaysville","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting outside with my dog, smoking when I heard what I thought was a loud jet, looked up and saw a massive rectangular craft descending much like a plane, however this almost appeared to be more like a giant flying tank or something; it was huge and had no wings or propellers; it was flying very low and appeared to be making a landing nearby, possibly at Hill Air Force Base in Layton, UT, just south of here. The craft disappeared my view behind some homes before I could take a photograph. This happened just after 7:00 PM, which seems quite early for an experimental craft to be out flying."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-111.950299","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35818.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35818.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.030094,+-111.950299(35818)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35818) map </A>","Latitude":"41.030094","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"Utah","Log Number":"US-02142012-0027","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Kaysville","There were no other sightings in Kaysville on or around February 13th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"02/13/2012 07:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Massive Rectangular object with lights on each of the four corners appeared to be landing just south of my home","Date Submitted":"02/14/2012 09:44 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"35818"}
