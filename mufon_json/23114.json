{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was laying on my couch watching T.V. with my living room curtains open when I glanced out side and looked toward the sky. I saw a bright light that didn't appear to be moving, so I called my friend Theresa (who is also my neighbor across the hall) and asked her to take a look at the object. We both went outside and got some binoculars to try a see what it could be. It was higher than one of the tall trees in the area, but did not appear to be moving at all. Through the binoculars we could see several small lights within a circle. At times, even with the naked eye, we noticed what appeared to be a blackish like orb around the bright circle. It stayed in the same place for about 45 minutes then slowly (very slowly) started descending down slightly and across towards the right of where it had been. After about 15 minutes it started moving back towards the left and appeared to be moving further away. It is now 12:25am and we can still see it in the sky but it is getter quite a bit lower."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"05/03/2010 10:30 UTC","Object Features":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-05042010-0002","Summary":"several bright lights within a circle shape, at times a blackish orb appeared around it","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"60.558154","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Kenai","There were no other sightings in Kenai on or around May 3rd 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Alaska","City":"Kenai","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23114.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23114.html"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"23114","Date Submitted":"05/04/2010 04:27 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-151.248783","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=60.558154,+-151.248783(23114)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23114) map </A>"}
