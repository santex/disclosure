Having a discussion with a friend I had not seen in awhile. Noticed light at about 45 degrees above the horizon. Weather conditions were cool and damp, full cloud cover. Visible was only fire. My first reaction was one of fear- that perhaps there was an aircraft on fire. This was very obviously fire, but then I realized it wasn't moving. The intensity of the brightness varied some- but not a lot at first. The object stood stationary for several seconds to a minute, then moved, and paused again. This occurred several times over the course of about five minutes, and then the object faded to the point that it was no longer visible. This was witnessed by several other people. The object appeared as a fireball, and there was no audible noise, and it was dark outside so nothing was visible around the object. It was very interesting, and I wish that I could have captured it on video, It would have been great to see it for longer, and hopefully it will be seen again someday!"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-75.730463","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-05122013-0017","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47369.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47369.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/11/2013 08:30 UTC","Region":"New York","City":"Sylvan Beach","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.196458,+-75.730463(47369)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47369) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Latitude":"43.196458","Case Number":"47369"}
