{"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-87.628618","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking pictures of the John Hancock Building downtown Chicago and accidentally caught an unknown object in the shot. I did not realize it was there until I downloaded the pictures to my computer and took a closer look at the cloud like trail from the object in the upper right hand corner of the picture. It appears to look like something coming in at a high rate of speed. I do not think it is a meteor but not sure. The picture has fairly good resolution and can be blown up to get a better look."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.887204,+-87.628618(37973)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37973) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Illinois","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown, N/A","City":"Chicago","Summary":"I was taking pictures of John Hancock Center in Chicago and did not notice object in upper right of picture until after downloading to computer.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37973.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37973_submitter_file1__JohnHancockCenterChicago.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37973.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/14/2008 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/06/2012 10:31 UTC","Log Number":"US-05062012-0028","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were 3 other sightings in Chicago on or around June 14th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"41.887204","Case Number":"37973"}
