We noticed blinking lights to the north about 30 degrees above the horizon. The lights were varying in color and stationary for the 10 minute duration we were there. The kids were cold so we left after about 10 minutes. It apperaed to be at a distance of 10 miles or so. Witnessed by myself, my lady friend Maria and my son 8 and daughter 9."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.64127,+-81.399051(12944)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12944) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
