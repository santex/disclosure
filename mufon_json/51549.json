I poked my friend, he turned around and we were both in awe. It was a large, blue, flaming with tentacle like flames. We all looked forward, then back repetitiously. It was going the same speed with the car, just following us. The first thing I said was \"That's a buckin' UFO!\"Then, it Just disappeared ( like most UFOs)."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wilmot","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/14/2009 10:30 UTC","Longitude":"-96.85785","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51549.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51549.html"],"Latitude":"45.408573","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"South Dakota","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
