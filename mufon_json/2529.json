It was completely silent,and gave off someform of energy signature,which I felt. Then it slowly began to gyroscopicallyoscillate,faster and faster,until it became like a round object.Before that,itresembled a disc,with a cupola,a segmented leading edge,and a beacon on thebottom.Then it stopped oscillating.The following lights appeared,in thisorderThe lights were the size of a half dollar.Three lights in the form of atriangle.Four lights in the shape of a rectangle, then one pinpoint light,whichstretched in two opposing directions,approximately four-six feet long.I felthypnotized,but not afraid.In fact ,I outstretched my right arm towards it,straining every muscle in my arm. The next thing I remember is walking back tothe platoons tent,after the disc floated north,towards Iraq. My watch showedthat over an hour had passed,yet it only seemed like two or three minutes.
