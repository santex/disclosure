This object was a fourth the size as the one seen on July 4th 2010 because it was at a much farther distance. No visible blinking lights as seen through 10x30x50 zoom Bushnell binaculars. My wife and I were stargazing just prior to my taking our dog for a short walk. If I had continued to stargaze lying on a patio lounge chair I would have missed seeing this object because it was so low and distant in the southern sky. This is only the second orangish-red moving object I have seen in years of watching the night sky. Time of sighting was exactally 10:50 pm. same as on July 4th. coincidental???"],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","City":"Erie","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24578.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24578.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-80.076149","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-07172010-0003","Date Submitted":"07/17/2010 12:57 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.134094,+-80.076149(24578)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24578) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
