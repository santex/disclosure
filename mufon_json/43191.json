{"divs":["Sighting DetailsHere is what happened, normally I am not home during on weekdays during working hours, however my childcare (nanny) was sick and I didn���t have a back-up. Anyway, we went to the boardwalk so I can run a few miles and my daughter loves being pushed in her running stroller��� sorry Anyhoo, I was deciding which way I would run first, I enter the Staten Island Boardwalk on Seaview Avenue and Father Capodanno. I turned toward the east and all of a sudden from nothing to a flying object that looked like a STINGRAY it moved like a stingray, it was the same color as a stingray. To me, it appeared to have like a light green and pale pink energy around it and it also appeared DISTRESSED���. It was barely moving and I watched it until it vanished���. It didn���t fly away fast it just became invisible, or I want to say transparent with the clouds. As I mentioned it appeared distressed, and I am not the only one who thought that because the police helicopters were searching, several helicopters for a very long time��� I thought I saw it again over the Verrazano bridge, but again in a second it was transparent again. I could see the energy around this thing and it was amazing��� Also, as you will be able to see in the photo, there was NO plane pulling it!!!!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/10/2012 03:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Please see below","Latitude":"40.716323","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/12/2012 03:31 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10122012-0017","Case Number":"43191","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43191.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43191.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.716323,+-73.998283(43191)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43191) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-73.998283","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There was one other sighting in New York on or around October 10th 2012"],"City":"New York"}
