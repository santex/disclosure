Friday, last light . Followed immediately by fighters overhead.","divs":["Sighting DetailsJust after eating dinner , I sat in my livingroom in front of the t.v.. It was very hot , It was a sky well marbled with clumps of clouds . My fan was running in front of the deck opening . I sit on the floor , crosslegged . I happened to look out the door , something caught my eye . As it occurred I just filed it away . I have a photographic memory . I'm currently unemployed , my mind is free of cludder . The object struck me as a plane moving north , 30 dgrees north . It turned 10-15 miles downrange , and heading more or less west . As my mind recalled what I just saw , I realized It was lighted on top of the wing , and on the bottom . The shape was like an opened ladder , with the top step the front point . I began to question why lights were arranged to show a thick body . The lights were all uniform in brightness , and spacing . And there was a sound , nothing extrordinary , just a low even rumble , sort of soft (i'm a old mechanic). But again , reviewing , in my mind the associated sound was all wrong . The object never lost altitude as far as I observed . The engines never whined or powered up . The same rpm , the same altitude . Traveling smoothly and rapidly . The part that confirmed in my mind what I just saw , was the roar! of fighters above . So high I couldn't see the fighters at all . The roar followed the path of the ladder in the sky , until I could no longer hear them . My father encouraged me to file a report . He told me of his sighting . I didn't know . ( oh and by the way , I was not drinking . I can not drink any longer ) Thank you ."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-104.98387","Date of the Event":"07/30/2010 09:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24889.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24889.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Region":"Colorado","Log Number":"US-08012010-0017","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Englewood","There were no other sightings in Englewood on or around July 30th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/01/2010 08:20 UTC","City":"Englewood","Case Number":"24889"}
