My father, mom, brother, sister and myself all went outside. Hovering above the golf course west of our house was a HUGE disk shaped object. It was actually shaped like a car tire with no center hole. Since it was dusk what we were watching was actually the silhouette outlined in the brighter evening sky, rather than seeing the clear surface of the object. As we watched it became apparent there were port holes all around it every 4-5 feet or so. It seemed like every other one was red or yellowish-white. The object was about 60 feet in diameter and rotating slowly as it slowly came toward our back yard. Its height was no more than 120-140 feet off the ground (perhaps as low as 100 feet). I remember thinking I could hit it with a rock. It did not wobble on it's axis as a balloon might but was perfectly controlled. It moved very slowly (perhaps 5 mph) and came right up to the SW corner of our yard where it paused (about 60 feet away) before it slowly started reversing direction to head back across the golf course toward Green Acres Terrace across the golf course. When it got over to the circle on Green Acres Terrace it reversed again and came back toward us but only came back until it was about 100 yards away this time. When it reversed this time it went farther away and then came back toward us again but did not get as close as the previous time. I asked my father, \"Dad, what is that?\" He said, \"I don't know.\" I knew what it was; a UFO. I told my brother to go inside and get my Polaroid camera. He said, \"YOU go get it!\" The object seemed to be almost swinging back and forth as it moved in a kind of searching pattern back and forth across the golf course moving further away with each pass until it was gone within 15-20 minutes. It was rotating slowly the whole time."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Farmers Branch","There were no other sightings in Farmers Branch on or around August 13th 1973"],"City":"Farmers Branch","Case Number":"3980"}
