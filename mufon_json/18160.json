I then noticed a round object hovering below a cloud top to the thunderstorm. What caught my attention was the black dot standing out against the cloud and lightning. I was able to watch the object for over 4 minutes.I first thought the object was a balloon but with the wind in the area from the storm it was stopped. Object gave the appearance it was spinning.It was black and a second color that was nearly the color of a flame or copper color. As I watched it it began to lift into the clouds and the flame color disappeared. This happened about 30 seconds before a jetliner headed to Hobby airport flew just below the area the object was in. I then noticed it just to the side of a cloud and it lifted extremely fast into the clouds as a second jet flew into the area. I did not see the object after that. THe two jets were Southwest Airline 737s."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18160.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18160.html"],"trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around July 18th 2009"],"Longitude":"-95.36364","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07182009-0016","Tags":"City","Latitude":"29.768023","Object Shape":"Circle","Source":"MUFON"}
