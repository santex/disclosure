My wife told me about a strange light in the sky. I thought it strange that this thing was so bright and changing colors. It was hovering in the direction of Tracy Municipal Airport and New Jerusalem Airport west of the highway. It would rise smoothly, hover then drop as if it were on a track. The object would change colors from green to orange. Last I saw it dropped out of sight and we had to keep going south. We spent the next half hour trying to come up with an explanation for it but nothing I know of does those things. Not sure how far it was from us or of its size."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"Ripon","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"25190","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Object would rise and fall changing colors from green to orange.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
