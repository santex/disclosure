I love looking at the stars ahead of me as I am walking. This was totally differnt.The time was 6.00 to 6.03 am. A very white, bright, round light appeared from no where. It was about the height a small plane would be flying and about the size of a greatfruit. Very round in shape. Moving across the sky pretty fast. Then it stoped for about 3 to 4 seconds, got even brighter then exploded and disappeared all at the same time. No trail, no falling things and no sound.

This was a perfect round circle, and you would think we could have heard somthing. I would like to know what it was."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33234.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33234.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"My daughter an I were walking our morning walk, about 6.00 am we looked up and seen a very very bright light, round in shape going across the sky, no tail like a falling star or meter.
