Looking at stars noticed one come out of nowhere, and started moving across the valley, from SSE to N. Then all 8 of us started checking the sky with our equipment. Not sure at first what it was, no blinking light, and objects hoovered, disappeared, and faded off into the distance. We were equipped with 20x70 binoculars, Night Vision scope, and thermo-imaging camera and a laser light. At first excited, some of us got the chills, espeically after on one we flashed the laser light at it and it flashed us back, with a bright light everyone noticed. We lost sight of the objects, one weaved back and forth and then dissappeared, some we just lost sight of in the distance, looked like they were headed upward. Some just seemed to vanish, others seemed to fade out."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Millcreek","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"06/08/2013 11:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-06092013-0021","Longitude":"-111.875491","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Millcreek","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48002.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48002.html"],"Summary":"using 20x70 binoc.
