I pointed at it and told him to look, when he had his eyes on it I went inside to get the video camera and two of our kids came out to see it. It was at first stationary and about the size of a pencil erasure at arm's length. It was about 70 to 80 degrees up and North of us. It moved towards the North East and at one point zig zagged as it went behind some trees. We moved to another area to try to find it again. When we spotted it seemed further away as it was smaller and continued to get smaller until none of us could see it any longer."],"Date Submitted":"09/03/2007 04:42 UTC","Region":"Oregon","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.755405,+-122.486967(7836)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7836) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/03/2007 04:42 UTC","Summary":"white sphere moved towards the northeast until too far away to see","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7836.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7836_submitter_file1__ball1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7836_submitter_file2__ball3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7836_submitter_file3__ball5.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7836.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-122.486967","City":"Prospect","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"7836","Weather Factors":"Windy, Medium","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Latitude":"42.755405","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Prospect","There were no other sightings in Prospect on or around September 3rd 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
