A few fireworks began and while looking up we saw this strange red object. It was glowing and seemed to be transparent with a white light emanating from inside. We thought it was some kind of balloon at first but we realized right away that it was something very unusual. We watched it float into the distance at a steady pace. It appeared to stop and hover for a few minutes and then disappeared. We were very excited because we knew we had seen something rare."],"Log Number":"US-07062012-0031","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.60637","Latitude":"36.318346","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.318346,+-95.60637(40316)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40316) map </A>","Region":"Oklahoma","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
