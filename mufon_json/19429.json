{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn Sept. 19, 2009 about 8pm we spotted a UFO in the South Western Sky. We are located on the Long Island Sound in Rock Point New York. The night sky was completely clear, you could see stars all around. There were absolutely no clouds and no moon either. The UFO was shaped like a gum drop with a bright bluish white light beaming out of the bottom of it. It hovered, making no sound whatsoever for about 10 seconds. The UFO then moved upward quickly into a fog like mist; while at the same time, the bright beam of light disappeared as if closed like a clam shell."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.960199,+-72.91849(19429)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19429) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19429.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19429.html"],"Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 12:00 UTC","Summary":"UFO sighting Long Island Sound in Rock Point New York","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Rocky Point","There were no other sightings in Rocky Point on or around September 19th 2009"],"City":"Rocky Point","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 09:40 UTC","Longitude":"-72.91849","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09192009-0046","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"19429","Latitude":"40.960199","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York"}
