I was looking at the moon in the daylight and noticed a very small object passing infront of it. The object had to be at the outer boundries of our atmosphere, a grain of sand held at arms length could have blocked out the object. The object was an orange-red color, going south very slowly compared to a satellite. I checked out Heavens Above to see if anything was passing in that location at that time and there wasn't anything."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9957.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9957.html"],"Latitude":"37.263832","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Saratoga","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.263832,+-122.023015(9957)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9957) map </A>","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Saratoga","There was one other sighting in Saratoga on or around March 16th 2008"],"Longitude":"-122.023015","Date Submitted":"03/16/2008 05:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03162008-0008","Case Number":"9957","Summary":"An orange object passed infront of the moon."}
