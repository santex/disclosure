I ran out the back to the river and seen it, it was heading north.I thought it was a star at first but then it started to shuffle like.At this time it looked blue and i couldnt see the blinking lights but it seemed as it was getting bigger then smaller(like a big star then little star and did this a few times) and it moved behind the trees so i ran inside( i hung up on my friend then) grabbed the binocs and watched it thru those. It seemed to be orange reddish then and it was shuffling again then it started to do crazy moving like circles and zig zags and such it was crazy then it was gone in a heart beat.I didnt take a picture at the time ...Im still kicking myself for that."],"Viewing Distance":"N/A","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Defiance","There was one other sighting in Defiance on or around April 5th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"04/05/2012 01:03 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.288453,+-84.35003(37136)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37136) map </A>"}
