{"City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Boomerang","divs":["Sighting DetailsOutside house facing south. Moon was up and at about a 45 degree angle. Large bowe shaped, semi-transparent almost cloud like object with 6 plus non pulsating lights moving very fast. Planes were in the area at the time. Very big compared to the planes. Object flying about 1000 feet relative to clouds in the area. Vanished like a ghost after 30 seconds. I am not sure what isaw but it was not like anything I have ever seen. Not a cloud or plane or blimp. Not like any object I have seen except like a ghost like B-1bomber: that is the best way I can describe it."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42088.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42088.html"],"Case Number":"42088","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"08/27/2012 11:57 UTC","Longitude":"-99.898263","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.970659,+-99.898263(42088)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42088) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08272012-0037","Summary":"Big bowe shaped almost transparent object with about 6 lights on object.
