I noticed a very bright object moving from northwest to southeast at a relatively slow speed. When I first noticed it I thought it definitely wasn't a satellite because it was as bright as Venus in its gibbous phase. At about 10 seconds after I noticed it there appeared to be a course change to the south. I continued watching for about 3 minutes until the object disappeared behind some trees. About 5 minutes after this sighting I noticed a dim object moving from west to east at a relatively fast speed. I figured this was a satellite because I've seen a similar object on the same trajectory at about the same speed before. I'm always watching the skies. I just wish that L.A. didn't have such light pollution."],"Summary":"VERY bright object appeared to change course","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/12/2008 05:30 UTC","Latitude":"34.055854","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"Los Angeles","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"11/12/2008 05:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11122008-0007","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13678.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13678.html"]}
