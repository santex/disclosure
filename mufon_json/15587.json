My husband at first thought it might be a helicopter with one of those big lights flying low. But it could not have been a plane or a helicopter. It made no noise at all, had no blinking lights, and flew smoothly through the sky right over our heads. We then followed it in the car up the street. It then appeared to gain speed and gain altitude. We watched it as it got smaller and smaller and started to just look like a star once it got high enough in the sky...then it disappeared. It appeared to accelerate into space until it disappeared. This was very very strange. Cant explain at all what it could have been. We all were freaked out, when we got home my husband called the police but they said nobody had called about it. I got on line to see how to make a report."],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"02/18/2009 09:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"15587","Summary":"Large silent orange ball flies low and then disappears into space.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"40.59319","Date of the Event":"02/18/2009 09:45 UTC"}
