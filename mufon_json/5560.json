{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were driving north on Dickerson and he noticed a flock of white birds that you can see one minute and dissapear the next. I looked to see the birds and didn't see them but, I saw a large white sphere in the sky that did not appear to be moving. It was not metallic or glowing, just large and white. I pointed it out and we had no idea what it was. I then saw the birds fly by and I could tell by the size of the birds that this object seemed very large. It was too low in the sky to be a planet and too big to be a ballon. I saw several planes fly over it and it seemed to be about the same size as a plane. I was able to see the object in the sky as we drove north on I-35 from Carrollton to Lake Dallas. I finally lost sight of it in Lake Dallas. It never appeared to move. Oddly, this object appeared 1 hour after sonic booms were heard from F-16 test flights of Lockhead Martin planes. About 3 hours later, we drove back to Carrollton and the object was gone."],"trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Carrollton","There were no other sightings in Carrollton on or around October 11th 2006"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-10122006-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.980152,+-96.883164(5560)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5560) map </A>","Longitude":"-96.883164","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/11/2006 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5560.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5560.html"],"Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Large white sphere over Texas","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"5560","Latitude":"32.980152","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/11/2006 12:00 UTC","City":"Carrollton"}
