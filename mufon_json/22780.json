Being Valentine's day leftover gifts, these floating balloons were bright metallic red. Once released, the two balloons floated up and up as we watched them rise. However, what caught our eye was further up and over to the right. We saw a shining chrome sphere that stayed in the same place in the sky, motionless up about 10000 feet. The fact that it did not move a bit really got our attention. What can do that? Five of us were watching and all of us five asked, \"What is that thing?\" It looked like a well defined white chrome sphere. It was in exactly the same place for at least 10 minutes. The bright ball shaped object was either reflecting light from the sun or it was sending out light in a blinking white sequence. It remained in exactly the same place int the sky... just hanging there perfectly still in the same location as it reflected bright light."],"Log Number":"US-04122010-0016","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.671472","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Scottsdale","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Scottsdale","There were no other sightings in Scottsdale on or around April 9th 2010"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22780.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22780.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Sphere -chrome ball reflecting light or emitting light in the morning 04/09/2010.","Date Submitted":"04/12/2010 03:09 UTC"}
