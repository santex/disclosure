(i have pilot experience so i consider myself to be a good judge of observance). i am a fairly avid reader of ufo phenominon however this is the first time i have ever witnessed anything out of the ordinary in this realm. i would never make a bogus claim and am confident of my observational skills. i was surprised at what i saw and felt a little excited when i went to get my binoculars. (i always keep them hanging near the door in the event an airplane flies nearby). i am cautious not to claim the object to be a classic ufo for the lack of blatently obvious unusual characteristics they are reputed to exhibit. the most compelling factors were the high speed, silence and to a lesser degree the bright light. (i realize, depending on atmospheric factors, that aircraft lights can appear to be rather bright at times). factoring in the vagaries of nightime observation and perception, at most, i would only go so far to call what i observed to be an \"unusual peculiarity\". i wish it could be run by me one more time for a more conciencious consideration. unfortunately, my attention to the episode was not completely piqued until the event was half over when i suddenly realized what i might be seeing. i was left scratching my head wishing i had intensified my observational effort from the moment i first saw it."],"Latitude":"42.300976","Region":"Ontario","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City"}
