{"Date Submitted":"04/22/2009 11:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI took my two little dogs out the other night to use the bathroom. I almost always stay outside to watch them because of wild animals around here - racoons, snakes, other dogs, etc. I live on Lake Livingston. And while I'm outside I usually look up at the sky because I like watching for meteors. It was a very clear night. I noticed what looked like a star moving steadily across the sky, going from a northwesterly to southwestly direction. I thought it could also be an airplane but the light was steady, which is what kept my attention. Anyway, it moved across the sky and then just disappeared. There were no clouds at the time. I just thought it was kind of strange. However, I have seen this kind of thing in the past and just thought maybe there was nothing to it, which may be the case this time."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Trinity","There were no other sightings in Trinity on or around April 22nd 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"04/22/2009 11:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16669.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16669.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.945186,+-95.375496(16669)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16669) map </A>","Latitude":"30.945186","Longitude":"-95.375496","Case Number":"16669","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Summary":"Small object with steady light moved across sky and then disappeared.","Log Number":"US-04252009-0007","City":"Trinity"}
