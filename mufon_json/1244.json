It was on Sunday evening at about 9:30P.M. We walked to the Dayton Country Club Golf Course and were sitting when wesaw a cylinder-shaped, saucer-shaped object in the sky. It was right below cloudlevel and it was partly cloudy. There were lights on the front and sides, whitesparkling lights. We saw it in the south and it appeared to go north towarddowntown Dayton. Some of the white lights blinked, but it was hard to determinewhich ones. Like it might have been a plane (I first thought) but it wasdifferent than a plane. The lights were not exactly like plane lights. We sawyour (MUFO) UFO article in the newspaper and my booyfrined insisted that I calland report this sighting. We must have watched the object on and off all of twoto three minutes."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.725337","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Log Number":"901111","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1244.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1244.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/18/1990 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-84.174106","Date of the Event":"03/18/1990 09:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Ohio","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"1244","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.725337,+-84.174106(1244)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1244) map </A>","Summary":"Sighting of cylindrical saucer -shaped UFO."}
