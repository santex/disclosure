As I left my grandmothers that star was gone and the sky was dark with no signs of any stars at all. I drive home an notice the same bright circle of light and realize it is the same thing we thought was a star. I am watching it not move and pull over to try and take a pic and then it moves in my direction. I also realized there was another object the same as this not far in the distance. The way the objects were hovering and the movements blew my mind. I called my cousin, but no one else believes me. After freaking out while on the phone I decided to drive the rest of the way home since it wasn't a good neighborhood. I wonder if anyone else seen these tonight??"],"Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Pennsylvania","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"14586","Date of the Event":"12/28/2008 08:15 UTC","Latitude":"39.960095","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-75.162359","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.960095,+-75.162359(14586)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14586) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/28/2008 08:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14586.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14586.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
