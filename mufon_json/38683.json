My friend and I stood in the parking lot of my apartment complex watching it for about 15 minutes or so. It had a broad white light that faded in and out (I think because of changing directions) and a constant red light. When I first saw it, I noticed that it flew like nothing I've ever seen before (given, I don't have much experience with flying objects). I pointed it out to my friend and we watched it. We tried to take videos with our iphones, but were unable to zoom so it's really hard to see on the camera what it looked like. Eventually we couldn't see it anymore through the trees and other buildings, it seemed to be flying away from us."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/31/2012 02:28 UTC","Log Number":"US-05312012-0003","Date of the Event":"05/30/2012 10:30 UTC","Case Number":"38683","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38683.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38683.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Region":"Oregon","City":"Portland"}
