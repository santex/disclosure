I often stand on the deck in the center of the yard and gaze up at the stars at such times. I noticed a dim light in the sky to the east-northeast, moving a bit fast. I thought it was a meteorite, but as I watched, it seemed to change course and ���fly��� horizontally. As the light approached, it appeared to have a definitive shape, sort of like a wedge or boomerang. The entire object seemed to glow with a faint reddish-orange light, and there appeared to be rows of slightly brighter lights underneath it. From my perspective, it would have been approximately half an inch wide. I heard no engine or wind noise. The object passed overhead and continued on a straight path toward the west-southwest. From the moment I first spotted it to the moment it disappeared from sight, about eight seconds passed."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.026626,+-122.130122(25915)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25915) map </A>","City":"Martinez"}
