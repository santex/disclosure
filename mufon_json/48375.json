{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy girlfriend and I were outside by our pool and noticed this bright ball of light that seem to be traveling at a high rate of speed. We noticed that it was a continuous light. There were airplanes at roughly the same elevation that had their blinking red lights on, this had no blinking lights. It flew very fast from a South West direction in a straight line to the North East. When it flew overhead, there was no jet sound like most make when they pass. I have never witnessed a \"UFO\" before. All I know is the characteristics where not the same as jets that fly over at night. It had a high altitude, it did not pulsate or move abruptly in any direction, it stayed on a very straight continuous flight path until we could not see it any longer when it went behind some clouds by the moon. We tried to take video with our cell phone, however it was at such a high altitude at night, it did not show up. I would not report this if I thought it was an airplane or jet."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Date Submitted":"06/24/2013 12:09 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48375.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48375.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-111.744803","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Very bright ball of light traveling at a high speed, no blinking lights like airplanes in the area about the same elevation.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Region":"Arizona","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"48375","City":"Mesa","Latitude":"33.426183","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/23/2013 08:50 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.426183,+-111.744803(48375)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48375) map </A>","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Mesa","There were no other sightings in Mesa on or around June 23rd 2013"],"Log Number":"US-06242013-0001"}
