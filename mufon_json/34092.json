{"Summary":"6 circular lights in a circular rotation moving from side to side then vanishing","Object Shape":"Circle","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside on a partly clear night letting the dogs out when I happened to see the object hovering in the sky between cloud cover, it just caught my attention. I first thought it was a projection, but it being so cold and in an area where projections wouldn't make sense, I immediately knew it wasn't one, as there was no trail of light from projection, and why would it be such a weird looking projection? Could not be. It had 6 bright white lights and was formed in a circle shape, and they would move slowly from side to side, maybe 50 feet in between. It lasted for about 8 or so minutes and then just disappeared. I've never seen anything like it before and am still shocked what I saw because I never thought anything like it would ever happen to me. Strange for sure, just vanished."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34092.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34092.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/18/2011 01:18 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New York","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.16763,+-77.606622(34092)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34092) map </A>","Longitude":"-77.606622","City":"Rochester","Date of the Event":"12/17/2011 10:17 UTC","Log Number":"US-12182011-0008","trends":["There have been 53 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around December 17th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"00:08:00","Case Number":"34092","Country":"United States","Latitude":"43.16763","Source":"MUFON"}
