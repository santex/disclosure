Duration of the event was approximately 2 minutes. No engine sounds were heard, and no navigation lights were observed. As soon as the first object left my sight, I observerd a second, smaller, brilliant white light which was moving slightly faster. It appeared to the north of my position at approximately 60-70 degrees above the horizon. It was moving from the north to the east and would have intersected the path of the first object. Again, no navigation lights were observed, and no engine sounds were heard. The second object appeared to be much higher than the first. The first object was slightly less brilliant than the planet Venus which was also still visible."],"Longitude":"-86.435412","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"11/21/2008 05:38 UTC","Case Number":"13892","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/21/2008 05:38 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"Moving Lights","Latitude":"36.99577","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.99577,+-86.435412(13892)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13892) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13892.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13892.html"],"Log Number":"US-11222008-0007","Region":"Kentucky","Disposition":"Unknown"}
