At 10:11pm the ISS flew over. There was a dim light a couple of degrees behind the ISS. It was following the same orbit as the ISS. I assumed it was the shuttle but learned today that it is still docked. There is a Russian supply craft that launched yesterday but it isn't scheduled to dock with the ISS until Wednesday (29 JUL), so I don't see how it would have been so close to the ISS already. That being said, in all likely-hood it was the Russian craft, but in case it can be proved that the supply craft wasn't that close to the ISS at that time, then I want to have it documented that an entire field of amateur astronomers near Pittsburgh saw \"something\". I am one of those."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"07/24/2009 10:11 UTC","Summary":"Viewing ISS pass @ a star party last night and saw an object trailing it.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/24/2009 10:11 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
