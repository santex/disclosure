It sounded like an inner ear vibration humming sound. I moved the curtain to look outside and saw what appeared to be a UFO. It had landed and had had bright rectangular windows. I was frightened and closed the curtain. I then heard what sounded like radio waves probing the room. I recall an electric current running through my finger tip. I then oberved three aliens. They were shiny like particles of energy and appeared to be smiling. They stood together and had antenae on there heads. I remember lying down and a light appearing over my midsection. I could see myself being pulled out of my body. I was miniturized and naked throwing punches as I was being taken out in a beam of light. My feeling was that they did not want to harm me. I also saw a huge asteroid fly over Los Angeles. You could hear and see it as it flew over at about 11pm, in 1999. There was nothing in the news about a huge asteroid."],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"Window(s)","Latitude":"36.787261","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"11/30/2001 04:20 UTC"}
