No sound and no wings.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside on the deck with my family at dusk when my wife noted, \"look at those planes\" to my daughter. I moved to see them expecting to see military planes which fly over often from nearby Fort Carson and instead saw two cigar shaped craft with no wings flying side by side. We all watched them fly from East to West over the maontains at a very high altitude over the clouds. They flew in the same manner and appeared to be the same size as two 747's cruising at 30-40,000 Ft - except they lacked wings. They made absolutely no sound. Even when jets cruise over at 35,000 ft, you can hear them out here. We watched for about 45 seconds as they disappeared over the mountains. It fely very strange as they did not appear like any planes we had ever seen before."],"Case Number":"25297","Date Submitted":"09/04/2010 09:56 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cigar","Longitude":"-104.604201","City":"Pueblo","Date of the Event":"09/04/2010 07:38 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.262587,+-104.604201(25297)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25297) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25297.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25297.html"],"trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Pueblo","There were no other sightings in Pueblo on or around September 4th 2010"],"Latitude":"38.262587"}
