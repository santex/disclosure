{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my cousin's room upstairs. He Has a window on his ceiling so you can see the sky. I was just happening to be looking out the window when I saw a black saucer like craft high up in the sky. It was still very bright out so I could see it clearly. It was flying slowly overhead and was wobbling as it flew. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life. I wish I had a camera to take a picture or even a telescope to see it up close. I just watched it in awe as it flew by, wobbling the entire time."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29551.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29551.html"],"Case Number":"29551","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.880794","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.880794,+-87.624158(29551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29551) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"06/13/2011 06:00 UTC","Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There was one other sighting in Chicago on or around June 13th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/14/2011 04:37 UTC","Longitude":"-87.624158","Summary":"Black wobbling saucer flying high in the sky","Log Number":"US-06142011-0011","Country":"United States","City":"Chicago"}
