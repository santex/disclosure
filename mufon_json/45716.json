Heading from the M2 towards catford London. I was in traffic so i was looking at the sky when i noticed an object very high. Traffic started moving so i pulled over whilst keeping an eye on it. It was travelling really slow, at one point it looked like it had stopped. As it was getting further away it looked liked it was getting higher. Lasted a good 5-10 minutes. What I could make out it was round and white. Travelled in a straight line. colour of the sun reflecting of it. Left no trail behind it. Wasn't a plane, had no wings and it was far to high to be a helicopter. What i felt at the time, gob smacked, Trying to work out what it could be and couldn't work it out. Lost sight of it when it got to far away."]}
