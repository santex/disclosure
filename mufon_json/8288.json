I always gaze up at the night sky. I observed in the north sky a boomerang or triangle shape with many lights.. As the object came closer above my house the lights began to breakup out of formation, kinda of dancing. I thought I must be going crazy. I watched it disappear into the south sky. I just stood there... about 2-5 mins lapsed, and I turned around to the east sky and looked up and it had circled around again. Same thing was happening... The lights broke out of formation then back into the shape of a boomerang or triangle. This time it dispeared into the west sky. I watched for many more minutes thinking I might see it again...Nothing, I know what I saw was really there. I wonder if anyone else saw it in Colorado Springs?"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/05/2007 10:05 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11062007-0001","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron","Summary":"Boomerang or V shaped object with many lights","Longitude":"-104.818463","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.842732,+-104.818463(8288)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8288) map </A>","Case Number":"8288","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There were no other sightings in Colorado Springs on or around November 5th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8288.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8288.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"38.842732"}
