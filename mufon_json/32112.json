{"Summary":"We witnessed 4 orange orbs, that hovered and then joined into formation.","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were walking to our friends house, right by the University of Pittsburgh, when we saw a bright light in the sky. At first it moved to quickly to be a plane or helicopter, but then it slowed down and vanished. Next, we saw another orange light move across another part of the sky, and then another in a different area. Finally, four of the lights came together in a diamond formation and hovered right above the city. Then, they broke formation and light went away, but we could see a metallic like object in the sky that was the same circular shape as the orbs."],"Viewing Distance":"N/A","Date of the Event":"09/24/2011 11:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"32112","Longitude":"-79.956522","City":"Pittsburgh","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-09262011-0018","Latitude":"40.434879","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/26/2011 04:53 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32112.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32112.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.434879,+-79.956522(32112)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32112) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around September 24th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00"}
