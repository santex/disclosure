two ramps of blue green light; saucer shaped with dome and a small white round light. some of these objects would hover then dart up into outer space at a very high rate of speed. these type lights are less common. i felt nothing unusual photographing the objects, as i never did filming them for around 2 years. in 2003 i bought a camcorder, and filmed the objects at a culdesac nearby where i live. they always showed at around 8:30 pm up unto 10:00 pm. they appeared sometimes in groups of three; they hover silently for minutes at a time then slowly move on their way; some look like jupiter; some connect and disconnect from each other; some have an eye inside that surfaces for a short time looking around in a circular motion on the inside surface of the object then disappearing inside; some show a very fast black surface storm going over it that looks like carbon. i was able to see these characteristics being that i have a digital zoom on my camera. i was able to get right up to them. sometimes the objects show at dusk. i filmed a ufo, at the same place, that flared out from a dot of light 7 times. and at around the time i stopped filming i turned around after filming, and i saw a big round white light 50 feet from me. it was only about 20 feet altitude. i said out loud, \"what the hell is that?\" as i started filming it i felt a strong telepathic presence all around me, except for the middle of my back. somehow i was able to see into the ufo, and i saw three aliens in it. one was a doctor, and the other two were workers. i do not know how i knew that. they were watching me in a small monitor, and the doctor said, \"what is he doing?\" then the object slowly lifted outward high into the sky then it stopped. then the doctor said, \"he's not doing anything.\" then the object moved on northward going behind some big trees. the doctor alien's skin was darker than the workers, and his eyes were a little different than the workers. the workers had grayish skin, and their eyes were egg shaped. in the 25 years i lived here in garden grove i had 5 alien close encounters where 3 took place in my apartment. england paranormal investigators thinks my film is amazing and fantastic. they told me that i captured a lot of unusual and interesting things. in fact having the largest paranormal website in england they wanted to make a hour cd out of my film. i have 8 hours of footage, but i did not use a tripod. however for some reason mufon does not care about my reports or at least does not contact me about any of them. only in 1994 mufon of o.c. did 2 investigations with me on the lights that were at the time coming a lot. they were coming in 2 at a time. in 45 minutes we saw about 90 of them. at the end of the 2nd investigation mufon covered up telling me that they were airplanes, and disneyland fireworks. 3 years later i spoke on the phone to ron rehger who was also a mufon investigator. he told me that those lights are in mufon's records as \"unknown\" meaning ufo. and peter davenport from the nuforc told me that none of the materials i sent him are alien related. recently i offered him my 8 hours of footage on dvd free. he did not even say thanks, but advised me to put it on the internet for others to see, and to see what they say. and in the 80s i sent him my first 2 photos where the objects stopped under a lamplight. he told me i sent him lamplights returning my photos. you can clearly see the oval objects under the lamplight. in fact i sent those 2 photos to the ufomrc in roswell, new mexico. doctor burleson there analyzed them on a data base computer, and confirmed to me that they are round. he sent me the data base printout that i still have. and seti told me i filmed aircraft. so i do not expect any attention for this or any report i make about the ufo\\alien subject. i am doing this because i am bored, and for personal reasons, so the subject might be better understood."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13367.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13367.html"],"Case Number":"13367","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-117.933038","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:02:15","Latitude":"33.777695","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"01/23/2005 08:30 UTC","Tags":"City"}
