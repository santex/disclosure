{"divs":["Sighting Details I looked up to watch passing commercial jets high in the sky and all of a sudden I saw a silent triangle with faint lights glide over me from east to west. appeared 5,000 feet to 18,000 feet. it appeared very large maybe 1,000 feet across. I am a pilot and know this was no airplane I have ever seen. It appeared to glide past at high rate of speed. It was amazing as it glided towards the ocean heading 240 degrees to the west."],"Date of the Event":"02/17/2012 07:00 UTC","Object Features":"Wings","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 49 other sightings in Huntington Beach","There was one other sighting in Huntington Beach on or around February 17th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35894.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35894.html"],"Latitude":"33.677864","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.677864,+-117.964246(35894)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35894) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"35894","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"California","Summary":"silent huge triangle with faint white light on leading edge may have had six light on each wing","City":"Huntington Beach","Date Submitted":"02/17/2012 10:25 UTC","Log Number":"US-02172012-0027","Longitude":"-117.964246","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
