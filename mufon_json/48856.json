I watched the light for about 2 min as it pulsated in a pattern starting with bright white, to yellowish orange, to a blueish green then it would fade out completely and then repeat the pattern. I watched it do this 3 times before it faded off into the distance. The whole time it kept the same SE trajectory with what looked like a small deviation in direction which may have looked that way because of the weird wobble it seemed to have. After it disappeared i kept looking to see if there would be more to see, after about 4-5 min i noticed a large aircraft approaching from the west heading east and flying kinda low. I noticed that this plane was large like a commercial airliner but it was moving very fast and low. was at least 7-10 seconds before i heard this plane after seeing it.... I would assume military... maybe tracking the object I saw.I was very excited after all of this as I am constantly looking up trying to see anything of interest I know they are out there I have seen an object before back in 1989 when i was young and I was hoping I would get the opportunity to see something again."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48856.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48856.html"],"Tags":"City"}
