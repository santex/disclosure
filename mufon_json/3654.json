{"divs":["sighting detailsmy son and i were driving home after running some errands when my son said, \"hey, look dad, one of those things like i saw a couple of years ago\". (he has seen these before!) i looked over to my left and spotted a long bright silver object \"hovering\"\\sitting motionless in the sky. we kept our eye(s) on it, and as we pulled over to the curb to get a better look, it disappeared. we both said at the same time, \"where did it go?!\" my son has seen these same type ufos on 3 occasions, but on 2 of the occasions the ufo was manuevering; when we saw it together july 5th, it was \"hovering\". very bizarre and very frustrating to not be able to bet a better, longer look at it. we can't even estimate the distance or the altitude, since we have no frame of reference. there has been, and there is a lot of ongoing construction, commercial and residential, with a stretch of freeway just completed in roughly the area where we saw the ufo hovering. maybe they are wondering why all the activity?"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"\"Cigar\" shaped bright silver object spotted hovering over Chandler, AZ","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-08012005-0010","Case Number":"3654","Date of the Event":"07/05/2004 01:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Chandler","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Arizona","Longitude":"-111.83808","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.31403,+-111.83808(3654)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3654) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date Submitted":"07/05/2004 01:30 UTC","Latitude":"33.31403","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3654.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3654.html"],"trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Chandler","There were no other sightings in Chandler on or around July 5th 2004"]}
