This night I was by myself and I noticed a light that I had never seen before. I thought it could be a new light pole. As I stared at it for about 5 minutes it looked to be pulsating. Then it shot straight up into space in the blink of an eye. It was truely amazing. I know that it was something out of this world, I believe it was an angel. I feel very blessed and lucky to have seen this. Every night I go to my top deck which is pretty close to the location of where I saw the orb, I have never seen anything like it since. But I am always looking so hopefully I will see something again one day. :)"],"Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.571205,+-97.95377(31671)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31671) map </A>","Latitude":"30.571205","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Leander","There were no other sightings in Leander on or around May 1st 1999"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Date Submitted":"09/09/2011 04:58 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path"}
