An airplane flew over, flashing its familiar red and white, and then from the northwest I saw a white light, nonblinking, traveling across the sky, towards my northeast. A smaller, also nonblinking white light traveled at a constant distance and speed behind it, probably less than an inch behind the first. After passing directly in front of me, the second, smaller light became hard to see, to the point where I couldn't tell if it had vanished or was still trailing the first. I attribute my loss of visuals to a cloudy night and more light pollution as the lights headed toward Fargo. I was able to see the larger, brighter light for a minute or so more before it passed out of my view. After Googling non-flashing, non-blinking white lights with trailing lights, I decided I wasn't sure what I'd seen, but given that I'd seen strange, blinking, hovering lights in the northwestern sky the night or two prior, I thought perhaps the sightings were related."]}
