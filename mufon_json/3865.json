The swaying of the trees seemed to intensify. I was unsure at first. It was the general saucer shape, but very colourful, and there were lights spinning all the way around. It hovered at least 20 feet over the ground. All most like it was peeking around the trees. I did nothing but stand theer in the short minutes it was there. but once it was gone and i realized what it was , I panicked and ran down stairs to my grandma and told her what happened. She didn't beleive me at first. But i was so adimit she finally gave in 10 years later. It finally zoomed away before I ran down stairs."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3865.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3865.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/30/1993 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
