I told my children who took a short while to locate it. I said \"There's a UFO\" and they searched until locating it then agreed it was an unidentified flying object. We watched for about two minutes and the object appeared to hover, but may have been moving closer directly toward us as it did appear to get slightly larger. I took three photos on my iPhone, but it was so far away it was not visible on the screen of the phone. When I downloaded the photos to my computer I could see a single light, but in the sky it looked about two centimetres across and only a few millimetres high. I estimate it was at leats a couple of kilometres away. While it was still some kilometres away it disappeared behind the cloud cover."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Murgon","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"LEaving a friend's house we noticed an elongated pulsating light hovering to the north.","Date Submitted":"06/21/2013 06:39 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"151.941327","Region":"Queensland"}
