They remained stationary right next to the fireworks until they were over and then began their path. They would disappear and reappear. It lasted for about 5 min until only one was left then that finally disappeared as well. It didn't look as though they flew away but more like they just shut off their lights. The lights were red orange similar to fire work ashes but stuck around for far too long to be that. Plus the re appearing and disappearing wouldnt allow this to be possible. Many people sitting near us saw them. Very odd experience. I forgot my phone in the car so didnt catch a picture."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.996528,+-88.17698(40176)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40176) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball","Region":"Illinois"}
