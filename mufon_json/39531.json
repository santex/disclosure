{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife answered a phone call from a neighbour regarding lights in the sky. She went out on the front porch then called me out to see. I saw a brilliant orange ball in the sky moving from SSE to NNW. It travelled consistently at about 1000 ft above ground and at an estmated speed of 500 to 600 KMph. Then another appeared approximately three seconds behind the first, then a cluster of six, and then several more, all about evenly spaced on the same track and velocity as the first one I saw. As they approached over the Ottawa River in the Vanier to Parliament Hill area, they simply dimmed and faded away. At least 2 neighbours saw them, but there has been no indication of it being reported or otherwise identified anywhere (news, Web, radio)."],"Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"06/16/2012 09:38 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/20/2012 02:14 UTC","Summary":"Several round orange balls moving across sky then faded to nothing.","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.364175,+-75.453464(39531)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39531) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"CA-06202012-0013","Latitude":"45.364175","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Ottawa","There were no other sightings in Ottawa on or around June 16th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Ottawa","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39531.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39531.html"],"Region":"Ontario","Case Number":"39531","Longitude":"-75.453464","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
