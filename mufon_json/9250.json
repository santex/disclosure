I then realized it wasn't even shaped like a jet, more like the classic disk shape. It was moving in a linear fashion from east to west across the northern sky, also, there were no clouds in the sky. I felt a feeling of wonder as I watched it move, I had recently began researching UFOs in my spare time, to see if there was anything to the phenomenon, a subject I now consider to be a realty. I eventually lost sight of it when it disappeared behind the roof of the house I was walking past, when I got past the house, it was gone."],"Log Number":"US-01252008-0020","Date Submitted":"10/31/2007 03:45 UTC","Case Number":"9250","Date of the Event":"10/31/2007 03:45 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-77.401741"}
