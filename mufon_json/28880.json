{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy fiancee and I were driving through Blackshear at aprox. 10 p.m. last night and saw two bright flashes similar in brightness to lightening. We then saw a light green ovaloid object with orange flames from the back of it moving through the sky west to east and making no sound. It seemed to be losing altitude but was not moving at an extreme rate of speed like a meteor. It was only visible for 3 to 5 seconds before being obscured by the tree line. Once on Hwy 84 driving toward Waycross, we caught sight of an extremely bright orangish light in the Eastern sky in the same approximate area of the previous burning object. It floated in the sky moving slighty from side to side before fading from view after a few minutes."],"Summary":"Light green oval shape with orange flame behind resembling the burn of an alcohol lamp","Log Number":"US-04302011-0016","Region":"Georgia","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Blackshear","There were no other sightings in Blackshear on or around April 29th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28880.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28880.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:04:30","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.309781,+-82.232666(28880)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28880) map </A>","Latitude":"31.309781","Date Submitted":"04/30/2011 09:32 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Sphere","City":"Blackshear","Case Number":"28880","Date of the Event":"04/29/2011 10:05 UTC","Longitude":"-82.232666","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
