{"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in an appartment building in downtown chicago, overlooking lake michigan.I was on the 37th floor.As I was wathching TV, which was in direct line with my bay windows and balcony,I saw a quick flash of what appeared to be a rocket shaped aircraft zip by mywindow at a veryt high rate of speed. There was nho sound or vibration.I recall seeing black markings, which looked like 2 numbers. It had a tail fin,and rear horizontal stabilizers. The rear of the aircraft glowed yelloworange,and had a rounded exhaust.By the time I jumped up, ran to the balcony 15ft it was gone.The reason I have waited so long to report this, is largely due to the fact thatI didnt know where to report to, however it has still leaves me thinking aboutwhat I saw for the briefest of moments. What was most disturbing was theproximity of the aircraft, the lack of sound or vibrations, and the velocity.This occured in february 1994, Im not sure which day.Thank You for your time."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Chicago","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around January 31st 1994"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.879954","Weather Factors":"Windy","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Log Number":"","Region":"Illinois","Longitude":"-87.624188","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1986.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1986.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/31/1994 09:40 UTC","Summary":"possible military aircraft.","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Case Number":"1986","Date of the Event":"01/31/1994 09:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.879954,+-87.624188(1986)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1986) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO"}
