{"Summary":"Traveling southbound on interstate towards Morton IL, saw light falling straight towards ground,","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Morton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.612816","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["sighting detailsi was driving south bound toward morton illinois on i74. myself and my brother, where heading to his fathers house, where i was dropping him off. we came about 1\\2 mile from the west\\south bound split on i74 just outside of morton. directly ahead of us, we both saw a light, about the brightness of a helicopter, or airplane light, falling exactly straight towards the ground. it was hard to tell about how far away it was, possibly 5 miles or more. the light was not flickering or flashing, it was a steady light, as it fell directly toward the ground, it disappeared about 100-200 feet above ground. when it came into view, it was only as high as we could see it out the windshield. what made us noticed it at first, was the contrast of the light from the cloudless country sky. there where little to no clouds in the sky, as most stars where viable, after just few seconds of focusing on them. the light itself was much closer than any star. the velocity of the light falling, was that of an object being dropped, like the force of gravity. it was not slow, nor was it oddly fast. it seemed like an average falling speed, for something like, dropping a baseball, or rock. like i said before, it seemed like 100-200 feet above ground, it dimmed out, until it was no longer visible. the light itself was not visible or traceable after it was darkened. the rate that it dimmed, was that of a headlight, or lamp, being turned off. myself and my brothers personal feelings after seeing this, where in awe. we kept asking ourselves, what it was, or where it had fallen. we where both talking and thinking about it for at least a few hours, i still am as i write this. i have not been able to think about anything else since then, it was a little more than an hour ago, it is still fresh in my mind."],"Country":"United States","City":"Morton","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-89.459261","Case Number":"19757","Date of the Event":"09/30/2009 07:56 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19757.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19757.html"],"Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09302009-0019","Date Submitted":"09/30/2009 10:14 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.612816,+-89.459261(19757)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19757) map </A>"}
