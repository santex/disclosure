At 8:50 PM we saw a single reddish orange glowing orb coming from the south moving slowing northward; it was very low, maybe 250 to 300' above the rooftops. There was absolutely no sound being emitted from the illuminating sphere. We watched it for about 5-10 minutes as it passed over our neighborhood and then got into our car and drove to the gas station at the corner of Martin and Zerdt roads. We could see fireworks off in the distance so we sat in the car for about 15 minutes and watched. As we drove home heading west on Martin Road, we saw a formation of We couldn���t believe it when we saw a formation of 3 glowing orbs. This time I really thought, hey these things are extraterrestrial and I want to make sure there not hot air balloons or helicopters. So we slowed down to almost a complete stop, rolled down the windows to see if we could hear helicopter blades, but there was no sound at all. And they were not hot air balloons. We had traffic behind us, so we had to move on and we are not sure where they went, but assume they continued to move northward as did the first one. We were sitting outside and then around 10 pm we saw one more solitary glowing orb, but at a higher altitude then the others and this one was either blinking, or something behind it was blinking and we watched it move northward as well, then the dog barked, we looked away and when we looked up again it had disappeared. Then about 15 minutes later my boyfriend said, look at that satellite. And I said, where? Then I exclaimed, Wow, did you see that? He said I sure did, wow! We saw four distinct bright lights that looked like stars that were kind of in a cluster at first and then formed into a line and just zip off into space. It made warp speed seem slow, they just zipped up and off into space and where gone. Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before. We believe that since the orbs were so slow moving and close to the ground there must have been a number of others who saw the same thing on that clear 4th of July night in Huntsville, Alabama."],"Latitude":"34.739239","Longitude":"-86.579804","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.739239,+-86.579804(24257)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24257) map </A>","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Huntsville","There were 2 other sightings in Huntsville on or around July 4th 2010"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07062010-0008","Case Number":"24257","Summary":"Glowing reddish orange orbs moving slowing at about 200 to 300' above rooftops."}
