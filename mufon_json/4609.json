{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out for a walk in my neighbourhood. While turning a corner, I happened to look up into the sky, and see two very thin, very defined beams of light, SSW of my position, about 45-55 degrees above the horizon. I first thought that these were the Aurora Borealis, but they were stationary, did not have the pattern of Aurora, as I have seen them before, and only changed in brilliance. They also only occupied a very small portion of the sky. The second line, which was orange, then disappeared. The remaining line turned from very light blue, to pure white. I observed this white light, but the glare from the streetlights in the neighbourhood had washed out the object. I made it to a darker area, a pathway, and observed the white beam of light for about 5 minutes, until cloud cover obscured it. The object appeared to be simply a line, surrounded by a dull field of light. It was stationary. When I first sighted the object, there were two lines of light next to each other, one orange, and one light blue. The orange line disappeared, and the light blue one turned to white. A field of dull light surrounded the white line, and it then became blocked by cloud cover. I was stunned by what I saw, and felt that I could not adequately explain it. Afterwards, I attempted to scour the news for stories of meteor sightings, or instances of Aurora Borealis over lower North America, but found nothing. There were storms over the U.S. Midwest at the time, and I wondered if there was any correlation, as my estimate, based on object size, altitude, and position in the sky would place the object in that vicinity."],"Log Number":"CA-04032006-0002","Summary":"Two lines in the sky, stationary, observed SSW, 45 degrees above the horizon","City":"Oakville","Latitude":"43.457539","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.457539,+-79.694458(4609)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4609) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4609.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4609.html"],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Oakville","There were no other sightings in Oakville on or around April 3rd 2006"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-79.694458","Object Shape":"Cigar, Star-like","Region":"Ontario","Date of the Event":"04/03/2006 10:08 UTC","Case Number":"4609","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","Date Submitted":"04/03/2006 10:08 UTC"}
