I lived in Arizona from Aug 2005 - Aug 2008 in Pinal County city of Maricopa. The city of Maricopa is not in the Phoenix valley, it's actually 20 miles or so south of the valley. I used to work on 19th ave and 101 in North Phoenix. Driving home I would exit the highway 10 onto the Maricopa Highway heading south. This route would take me to the back side of South Mountain and The Estrella Mountains. Regularly around 8pm once I was on the Maricopa Highway and my view was no longer blocked by South Mountain, I would see Orange balls of light suspended in the air in formations of 1 to 2 to up to 6 or 7. These lights would appear and dissapear, and as I got closer to the city of Maricopa the lights would end up being much further away than first though. My take on these lights is that they are flares from military excercises near the barry goldwater bombing range. Since I lived south of the valley, we had a much better view of the southern sky which people in the valley are unable to clearly see due to South Mountain and the Estrella mountains. I, including my brother and several other family members would see these lights on a regular basis, and the sightings continued the entire time I lived in Arizona and probably still can be seen. These are excactly like the lights reported in the Phoenix lights incident, the only difference is that they are low enough so that people in the valley cannot see them because the mountains are in the way. In my opinion I agree completely with the analysis on the show I was watching on TV which prompted me to report this. On the night of the Phoenix lights incident the flares were dropped at a high enough elevation and they could be seen above the mountain. What I can say that if someone starting today drove the Maricopa highway on a nightly basis around 8pm they would observe the same lights. They look like orang balls of light floating over the city of Maricopa, but as you drive closer you realize they are much further South. After rationalizing the lights to myself and feeling 100% confident I know what they are, this second part of my story is a little different. On the night of the Phoenix lights incident, there was also a triangular shaped object described floating near south Mountain. I had previously heard the stories on this object but I was completely and utterly shocked when I actually encountered it. As I mentioned earlier, I worked in North Phoenix for the first 6 months I lived in Arizona. I would drive 55 miles each way to get from North Phoenix to the city of Maricopa. I left work one evening in January- Feb time frame around 7pm and started heading south on highway 51. In the North the drive starts off at a higher elevation which allows a view clear across the valley. Off in the distance I noticed a traingle formation in the area of South Mountain. It was strange because it almost looked like it was in the flight patter of planes coming in from the west and landing at Sky Harbor, but these lights were not moving. I was still very far North and eventually driving down the 51 the view is blocked due to the walls, bridges, ect. My drive down the highway 51 to the highway 10 to the Maricopa Highway was about 30 mins, so eventually I forgot about what I saw. When I got off the 10 and started heading South on Maricopa Highway, I looked towards the Mountains and was completely shocked to see this Giant traingle formation of lights suspended right behind South Mountain. This object at this time must have hovering in the same area for over 30 minutes. It was 5 lights in a Triangle formation, and it was very large. I could not believe what I was seeing, and I actually pulled over on the side of the highway with another car and we both got out and looked at the object. Eventually the object slowly moved from behind South Mountain in a Northwest direction between the Estrella mountains and dissapeared from my sight behind the north face of the Estrella mountains. This object was silent, and large, and did not change shapes. It remained a triangle. I can't explain the traingle, and how it remained it the same location for such a long period of time without being contested in any way. I know Sky Harbor Airport must have been able to see this object, but I didn't hear anything on the news. My best guess is Jan-Feb 2006 when I saw it because I only worked at that location from Oct 2005- March 2006 before deciding the drive was too far. I am still in shock that I actually saw the traingle that has been described in previous sightings. It was right in front of me and the size of it was what I was so taken back by because when I initially saw it I was about 30 miles away. I don't know what it was, but I sure would like to know."],"Date Submitted":"02/21/2011 01:00 UTC","Summary":"two seperate things, one was a series of cirular orange lights, the other a triangle","Latitude":"33.296017","Region":"Arizona"}
