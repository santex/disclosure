Then, my dad said \"Look, right there!\" and he pointed to a little white dot in the sky, and it was bright. It kinda looked like the north star, but brighter and bigger. Then, after about a second passed, It got REALLY big and REALLY bright, and then a really bright glow formed around it, and then It disappeared. It was big, white, and bright. We looked around in the sky, but we couldn't see it. He said that something told him to look that direction, then he saw it and pointed it out to me. He thought that it was a helicopter with a searchlight or something, but it disappeared. The object didn't move, it just stayed there and got brighter and bigger."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Date Submitted":"02/03/2010 11:35 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
