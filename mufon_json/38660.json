After a while, we had seen at least 8, and noticed they were changing direction, they were all rather close together. Then, once we were off the freeway, at an empty intersection we saw a ninth one, flying very, very fast and very low, the lowest we had seen, just above the roofs of buildings. then as we were watching it abruptly came to a complete stop, hovered for a while, which was really freaky, because we were the only ones at the intersection, it was almost as if it saw us watching it. then immediately got back up to speed, and bolted out of sight. we didn't see anymore after that. We were so intrigued, that we called some friends and family to ask what they knew about this."],"Object Shape":"Diamond","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38660.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38660.html"],"Latitude":"47.620794","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/30/2012 02:56 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"05/29/2012 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"38660","Summary":"9 diamond shaped aircrafts flying close together.","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Bellevue","There was one other sighting in Bellevue on or around May 29th 2012"],"Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"US-05302012-0003","City":"Bellevue","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
