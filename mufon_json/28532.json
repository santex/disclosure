After My friend went back inside,i decided to look further into this, it was then i discovered there was not just one, but about 20-25 of these. One of the larger ones was yellow and the other one was blue, and each had what looked like its own fleet,that is,if color is an indication of their races,several sped up and i saw a flash of light as they moved,and then they disappeared,this was the smaller ones, the two main ones didn't move much,i never believed in aliens until last night."]}
