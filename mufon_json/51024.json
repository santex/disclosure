Noticed one yesterday in western sky, however, did not really pay much attention to it. Today however, I noted a similar sight in the NE sky over Lake Erie. Looked to the W and noted same object as yesterday. Paying attention to the NE object I began to notice movement with the directions constantly changing. I had a clear view between the branches of two tree, there is absolutely no question in regards to the movement or the various direction changes. During this time period I also noted an plane flying (Well up in the sky) and was able to note the difference in the 2 movement patterns. What I saw was definitely not a plane or a star. I lost contact when I re-entered my house. I am 68 years old and look into the sky often, this is the first time I have seen something I cannot explain."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/23/2013 11:04 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Lakewood","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Lakewood","There were no other sightings in Lakewood on or around September 23rd 2013"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"51024","Longitude":"-81.814414","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51024.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51024.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.495705,+-81.814414(51024)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51024) map </A>"}
