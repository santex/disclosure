IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FULL MOON. I CALLED MY WIFE OUT TO SEE IT. SHE SAW IT THEN WENT BACK IN TO GET THE CAMERA. WHEN I LOOKED FOR IT,IT WAS GONE. THEN IT REAPPEARED AND MOVED FURTHER AWAY EASTWARD. THAT IS WHEN I GOT A PICTURE OF IT. THEN IT WAS GONE AND WE DID NOT SEE IT AGAIN. IT WAS OUR FIRST SIGHTING OF A UFO. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS, AND WE BOTH SAW IT. TV NEWS THAT NIGHT DID NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I SPOKE TO A NEIGHBOR A WEEK OR SO LATER AND HE SAW A RED GLOBE AT 2AM ONE NIGHT WITHIN DAYS AFTER WE SAW IT. I KEEP LOOKING FOR IT."],"Summary":"It was a red sphere with a white center.","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","City":"Melbourne Beach","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.07626,+-80.55272(24942)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24942) map </A>","Latitude":"28.07626"}
