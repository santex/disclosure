I was sitting on my couch looking at the sky. When I see this Green HUGE fluorescent light, it was like the fluorescent glow sticks that you can buy at the store, but 10 times brighter and deeper pretty color. The color was reflecting of the clouds and that gave me the view and I was able to determine the shape and see the sliver polish object. It was like round-oval, I was frozen during my conversation- speechless and the person on the grounds that was walk, said the \"WTF\". It looked like it was descending into the neighborhood. It was about a mere 7 sec of witnessing this site. Then it was gone. The person that I was talking too on the phone was like what is going on.. And I just stated that I saw an object flying, no sound or nothing, then it was gone. This was fast and I couldn't take pictures.."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.539376","Log Number":"US-10222013-0001","Date of the Event":"10/21/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51726.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51726.html"],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"Dome","Summary":"It was round oval shapes smoothly looking green fourescent lights bouncing of the clouds, that is why I was able to see it clearly.","Latitude":"29.892962","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around October 21st 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Houston","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Other","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"10/22/2013 12:07 UTC","Case Number":"51726"}
