{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe walked outside on a third floor balcony, and looked south towards downtown Orlando around 11:30pm. Looking at a cluster of stars, one began moving from a southeastern position travelling straight north. At first glance, we thought the object was a plane, or perhaps a shooting star, but dismissed both of those ideas when we noticed how fast the object was moving, and that it had no tail, nor did it burn out, like shooting stars normally do. The object traveled on a straight path heading from south to north. The sighting caused us to question what we were seeing, and ultimately, phoned a friend to tell him what we saw, and he referred us to this website. We lost sight of the object after it left our immediate line of sight, over the building we are in, and the trees."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.60591,+-81.330395(29374)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29374) map </A>","City":"Winter Park","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29374.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29374.html"],"Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-06032011-0020","Date Submitted":"06/03/2011 11:51 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.330395","Date of the Event":"06/03/2011 11:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"high altitude point of light moving at high rate of speed","Case Number":"29374","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Winter Park","There were no other sightings in Winter Park on or around June 3rd 2011"],"Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"28.60591"}
