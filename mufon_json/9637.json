I was supposed to be in bed but was standing in front of my window. All I remember is the craft was literally hovering above my street, right in front of my house. It was very bright, thin and somewhat boomerang shaped. I can remember being so scared, I could not move an inch or take my eyes off of it. I had the feeling that the craft was just hovering there, watching me for what felt like forever but had to have been less than a minute. Then, lightning fast, it took off and disappeared behind a palm tree located on the far right of me. By that time, I was breathing so hard and full on panicking. I ran straight to my parents room and woke them up. Of course, they didn't believe me and told me that I was \"just dreaming\". That happened over ten years ago and I can still recall how I felt and what it looked like and that it went past the palm tree. It's something I will never forgot and never ever doubt."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Summary":"Riverside CA Sighting","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02192008-0001"}
