((nuforc note: we have spoken with this witness on approximately six occasions, and we consider him to be an exceptionally well-qualified witness. he is a trained observer, and has served as an expert witness in courts of law. he has made an attempt to locate other witnesses to the event, but has not been successful, to date. pd)) upgrade to prior fort myers florida report - peter d., please see e-mail of today the object appeared to be of rigid construction, and did not flex or otherwise deform as it gyrated through pitch, roll, yaw, etc.. there was no visible \"weather balloon\" radiosonde package or parachute attached. it did not rise up to a higher altitude or disappear from sight. a subsequent lightly conducted search of internet sites selling professional weather balloons, and large advertising balloons (national and international) and other possibly related items, found nothing similar, so far. actually, it appeared during this lightly conducted search that weather balloons might not even come in \"hard\" silver, or at least i have not yet found any. weather balloons do come with telemetry packages and parachutes which are strung below the balloon on longish cable. this object has none visible. ========================================================================== reported to mufon by email, 12\\2\\11: i am a 66 year old former private investigator and courtroom certified expert witness to photos and video. at one time i emplyed 125 people. i was taking insurance photos of my florida home prior to a hurricane, sometime around 2004 when i captured the attached image of an unknown black object at the ceiling of my house. * * it had not been visible to my unaided eye when i took the photo. i only noticed it in the picture much later. okay, i know it looks like a fraud hockey puck on a string. its not; i'll say this once: if i had wanted to construct a hoax i could have made it less hoaxed looking. i note how it appears solid and reflects light. it is not a camera artifact; i tried but could not reproduce it. it is not somehow a repeat of the sink stopper below it on the sink. i have a second shot of it in a different positiion, blurred as if moving. the shots were a few moments apart. i have sent it out to maybe a dozen venues for comment but no one has gotten back to me. a few weeks prior to this incident i had reported a ufo to one of the websites. it had been an object i saw in the sky along with a witness in my car. it was a clear and hard as a car in a parking lot. it struck me as a silver disc, black on the bottom, some sort of decontrolled surveillance device. it rolled and banked slowly like a ferris wheel. when traffic moved we left it behind in the sky at about 3000 feet above fort myers florida. (a few years later i found an illustration of it, a ratheon hard balloon surveillance device \"being developed.\") at the time, i reported it to the sw florida international airport because it was close to the approach path. i was referred to an faa answering machine. a few days later a mr. smith or jones called to say there had been nothing in ghe sky at that time. he told me to report it to the ufo website, which i did. can you help me out here? when i show these pics to anybody their eyes glaze over. even if they accept it as real, the implications seem ungraspable to them. i grasp that i may have reported a classified surveillance operation that had gone out of control due to some nearby radio towers which were present. i grasp that i may have been investigated by some sort of other advanced surveillance device. i know the government withholds advanced science for around 30-50 years, and i think this was an advanced surveillance platform using some sort of invisibility (link moved to fi report box) cms 12\\19\\11 19:32 cst flg the website operator stated on his site that i was very credible and invited me on the air for that night with art bell, but i declined. im sending this to you because i saw your video and image expert on tv today. is it d'antonio? would you please investigate this? i have photos of the thing in my house."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-81.862668","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34210.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34210.html"],"Object Shape":"Disc","City":"Fort Myers","Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"01/04/2004 02:30 UTC","Latitude":"26.645248","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Summary":"t was very clear, razor sharp in our view.
