I HAPPEN TO LOOK UP TO THE SKY AND OBSERVED A LIGHT. AT FIRST I DID NOT THINK ANYTHING OF IT, BUT AFTER A MINUTE OR SO I REALIZED IT WAS NOT MOVING AT ALL. I TOOK OUT MY CELL PHONE TO RECORD THIS LIGHT. THIS LIGHT WAS NOT MOVING AT ALL, IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GETTING BRIGHTER THEN DIMMER, ALMOST LIKE TURNING ON AND OFF A LIGHT SWITCH OR FLASH LIGHT. IT DID THIS FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MIN. THIS LIGHT JUST DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIRPLANE HAPPEN TO BE FLYING BY. I WAS SO INTRIGUED BY THIS I JUST NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT THIS WAS. I KNOW IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE NOR A HELICOPTER NOR A BALLOON. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A BLIMP BUT I REALLY DOUBT THAT VERY MUCH."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"10/19/2012 11:55 UTC","Region":"New York","Latitude":"40.716753","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.716753,+-73.998383(43380)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43380) map </A>","Case Number":"43380"}
