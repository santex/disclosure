A bright light in its flight path off to the right not to far caught my eye perrifully. I assumed it was just a planet as it was white with no flashing or other colors. But then it brightened white at least 10x in size in a turning motion. At that time the sattelite i was watching moments before came back into my focuse as it approached the light. The satelliite passed into the light and then both disappearing. As i asked around to see if someone else had seen what had happened one of my friends completely away from me and the camp fire wittnessed the same occurence. He described what he saw the same way. No drugs or alcohol were involved with either of us."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Leavenworth","There were no other sightings in Leavenworth on or around July 28th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Summary":"i was watching a satelline pass over in the night sky. i light in its flight path caught my eye and began to brighten. i just assumed it was a planet, but then it brightened white at least 10x in size . the satelliite passed into it disappearing .","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"08/06/2012 10:12 UTC","City":"Leavenworth","Date of the Event":"07/28/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.762622,+-120.657315(41489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41489) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"47.762622","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41489.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41489.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
