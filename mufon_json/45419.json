That evening as I watched the sky above me I noticed an object almost perpendicular on my head, moved slowly and without sound, disc-shaped, surmounted by a cylinder which opened the door lit with orange light extremely bright. I watched with binoculars 10 * 50. A few seconds of observation about 5, then I passed the binoculars to my girlfriend.
