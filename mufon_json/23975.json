My sister in law was relaxing on the deck looking at the sky and she said, hey what are those two balls in the sky? The two white balls of light appeared first, and we watched them move away from each other. One started moving higher, and the other moved east. We didn't know what they were, but we knew they weren't planes. When we grabbed the binoculars, they just looked like balls of light that were moving through the sky. Approx. 20 minutes in, another one appeared and it was red. It moved to the east at first, very quickly, then it stopped, and began moving up, higher. Eventually they all dissapeared. My whole family watched them for 45 minutes."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Glowing balls of light moving through the sky and changing direction.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23975.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23975.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/26/2010 07:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There was one other sighting in Portland on or around June 26th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Tags":"City","Latitude":"45.526332","Log Number":"US-06262010-0023"}
