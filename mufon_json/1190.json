We wereabout 20 minutes north of Toronto, the sun was setting and I first noticed astrange eliptical orangy coloured object in the sky, it appeared to be quitelarge indeed. It was difficult to tell how far away it was but it must have beenat quite a high altitude. We all took notice of it, but kept on driving. Theobject appeared to be hovering and at the same time it seemed as if it wasgetting bigger and smaller very slowly - pulsating if you will. We observed itfor the next three minutes in amazement.
