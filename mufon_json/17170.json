It was moving SUPER fast, aproximately 2 miles from my position looking due West torward downtown Minneapolis from N. 169. The object did 3 salom turns and headed north. The turns were SO quick. And it sped off out of site to the north within 10 seconds.. I noticed this as I was walking through a hallway to the lunch room. The movement caught my eye, made sure it was not a reflection. At first I thought it could have been a balloon blowing in the wind, however it did not appear to be, due to it seemed to hold a constant elevation."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile"}
