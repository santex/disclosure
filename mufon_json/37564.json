To long of a story to tell here... but craft communicated to us. We see mostly triangles, and this one (not a triangle) that communicated to us in the field. I have video of first contact (summer of 2011), but just lights show up on actual footage. I have seen them as close as under 30 feet... seen the pilot (humaniod) sitting in the front of the triangles. Much activity."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37564.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37564.html"],"Latitude":"44.319004","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.594154","Region":"Michigan","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"04/18/2012 10:53 UTC"}
