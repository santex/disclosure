{"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing outside the front of my home speaking to my neighbor. I suddenly caught a glimpse of something bright overhead, and to the left of where I was standing. I immediately looked up and saw a round very bright blue ball of pulsing light. It was travelling from the south to the north. There was no sound. It was approximately 500 to 1000 feet in the air. As it was passing over the top of my house, I ran forward to try and follow it. Asking my neighbor \"did you see that\", \"can you see it.\" It disappeared, or I just couldn't see any sign of it. It did not have a tail or after glow coma, etc. It did not change direction or appearance. I have no idea what it was."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.124276","Log Number":"US-05262009-0021","City":"Las Vegas","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"17178","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.124276,+-115.166696(17178)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17178) map </A>","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17178.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17178.html"],"Longitude":"-115.166696","Date of the Event":"05/25/2009 11:15 UTC","Region":"Nevada","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Bright pulsing blue ball, passing overhead.","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There was one other sighting in Las Vegas on or around May 25th 2009"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/25/2009 11:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
