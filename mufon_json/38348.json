It disappeared behind a tree line and we lost sight when another came into sight from where the first had been spotted. This one also moved in the same flight pattern at about the same height and speed as the first. There was no variation in the speed or intensity of the light and it too passed behind the treelike and out of visual. It was then I went for my camera and sure enough a third orb came from the same area and followed the same flight path before disappearing behind the tree line. I ran to the other side of the deck where I could see the orb had changed direction and was moving south."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.718192,+-81.139262(38348)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38348) map </A>"}
