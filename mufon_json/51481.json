{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family and I had just finished dinner outside (on the patio) and my son and I stayed to watch the sky. We both caught sight of a oval-sphere object overhead in the sky. Which was somewhat low in the sky. Don't know exact feet. At first we thought it was a plane, however, it began to move in sharp turns, circular, up, then down, so we quickly rejected this, since planes don't move in these odd directions. Then it disappeared."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"51481","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in El Paso","There were no other sightings in El Paso on or around July 4th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"10/12/2013 11:31 UTC","Latitude":"31.858537","Log Number":"US-10122013-0006","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.858537,+-106.539994(51481)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51481) map </A>","Longitude":"-106.539994","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 07:33 UTC","Summary":"it was a brght white flying oval-sphere shape that appeared in the night sky.
