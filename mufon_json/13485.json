I saw what looked to be a star, and I noticed that it was blinking red and blue. I watched it for about five minutes then I went to get my wife out of bed to varify what I was seeing. And she came outside and agreed that it was blinking red and blue then we found another same type of thing in the same region of the sky but further north of the previous one. When I first noticed it I thought it was just a star but then when I saw the blinks of red and blue thats when I realized it was something else. Then we thought it could be a plane but it appears to be to high to be a plane and it is not moving in any direction. As of 1020pm central time it is still there and has not moved."],"Date of the Event":"11/02/2008 09:56 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"13485","Latitude":"34.734169","Region":"Alabama","Summary":"Red and Blue Blinks of light","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Huntsville"}
