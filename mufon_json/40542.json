To the right of the orb was the moon but yet the orb seemed much brighter than the moon. Quickly I called for my girlfriend to come witness what I was seeing and since she was close by she was able to see this object start moving then fade out. This sighting only lasted 12-15 seconds but it had a lasting effect. I felt as though I was being watched and that there was some intelligent design behind this object. My girlfriend could not explain what we had just seen and was obviously shaken up. This is just one of many reoccurring events that have taken place over the past month."],"Latitude":"38.290094","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40542.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40542.html"],"Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-07072012-0117","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.290094,+-85.577066(40542)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40542) map </A>","Region":"Kentucky"}
