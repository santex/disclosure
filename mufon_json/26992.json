He was clearly upset and flustered when he walked inside. He said that when him and his dad pulled up, while getting his jacket from the truck he looked up and noticed a small neon blue structure moving from my backyard. He said that it was level with our home and close in proximity to our house. He said that it kinda resembled a small model airplane or oval like craft, he said that it slowly crossed in front of them, turned its light on (described it as turning bright neon blue) then turning it off as it faded from his sight. He said it was as if was cloaking itself. He said it gave him the feeling that it was doing a surveillance of some sort. Sucks that I was the only one home. Has anyone ever seen such a thing near their home?"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Strange small neon blue craft in my backyard near back of house........","Date of the Event":"12/14/2010 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/14/2010 11:52 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Flint","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Object Shape":"Oval","Log Number":"US-12142010-0026","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
