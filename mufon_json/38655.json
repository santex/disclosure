I immediately recognized that it was not an airplane or helicopter as it was completely round, hovered, and had no blinking lights. I kept my eyes on the object as I went through an intersection and observed it for appoximately 15 seconds before it simply disappeared. I pulled the car over and parked along Division Street. I scanned the sky for the object and it appeared again approximately 30 seconds later. It was in basically the same place, though a few degrees off from its original position. Once again, it appeared to be a metalic silver spherical object with a very distinct outline - no lights, wings, rotors. I watched it for approximately 10 seconds before it disappeared or \"winked out\" once again. I continued to sit in the same position and scan the sky for 10 more minutes, but did not see it again. NOTE 1: I don't know if it's relevant or not, but observing the object did not make me feel excited, scared or uneasy; I simply felt as if I was observing any other sort of unusual object. NOTE 2: This is the second time I have seen an object in the air above Stevens Point, WI, that fits the description of the object listed above. I did not report the object the first time I saw it."],"Longitude":"-89.593897","Latitude":"44.510983","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Region":"Wisconsin"}
