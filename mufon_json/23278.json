{"Log Number":"US-05152010-0001","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsWent out to south porch of house to relieve myself after me and my partner got done watching a tv program. I looked up to the sky to enjoy the bright clear starlight night and as I changed my point of view from straight-up to NW view immediatly noticed a large bright star object moving from NW to SE, thinking it was possibly a satelite I called for my partner to witness what I saw, when she got from the couch to the south porch the object stopped, dropped straight down and behind a tree line. She was scared and went back inside, I was curious and walked to the south portion of the property and saw the same object moving slowly down then suddenly, in a flash, move back to the NW position, almost exactly where I first saw it. From there it seemed to change colors and move left, right and up, down for a short while before it eventualy dropped down out of sight."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"45.463023","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Ladysmith","There were no other sightings in Ladysmith on or around May 14th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.463023,+-91.104036(23278)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23278) map </A>","Tags":"City","Region":"Wisconsin","Date Submitted":"05/15/2010 12:01 UTC","Case Number":"23278","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"VERY bright object moving first from NW to SE then changed flight path(down) and QUICKLY back to NW position where it","Date of the Event":"05/14/2010 10:15 UTC","Longitude":"-91.104036","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23278.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23278.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Ladysmith","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown"}
