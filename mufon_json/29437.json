I know it was not an airplane because I saw a few of those in the sky too at the time and could tell they were airplanes by the way they were moving and how their lights were blinking. What I saw was a lot higher than the altitude that airplanes can get to but it was either big enough or close enough for me to have seen it. I first thought I was maybe seeing a \"Shooting Star\", but I have seen those in the past and what I saw did not have a \"tail\" and it was gliding."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"06/03/2011 11:00 UTC","City":"Lee's Summit","Summary":"Bright Star-like Figure","Date Submitted":"06/07/2011 02:50 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.923793"}
