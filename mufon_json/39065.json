{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was around 6 pm that I was next to my park vehicle and was looking in the direction of NE and gazing at the clear blue sky. That when I noticed the cylindrical elongated silvery shape object flying from east to west, I heard no sound , no wings, and flying in a straight line no more the 3000-5000 ft above land. I had my cell phone with me which has a 5 mega pixel and took several pictures. The sighting lasted for about two minutes. I took about four pictures an in two of them I noticed an oval shape dark object trailing below and to the right of the original cylinder shape object. ( of note this is not the first time I seen this object before, and flying in different directions)."],"Case Number":"39065","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.506341,+-87.316709(39065)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39065) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"36.506341","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Clarksville","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"06/09/2012 12:26 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"06/05/2012 06:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39065.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39065.html"],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Clarksville","There was one other sighting in Clarksville on or around June 5th 2012"],"Region":"Tennessee","Longitude":"-87.316709","Log Number":"US-06092012-0005","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Appeared to be cylinder, silvery reflective, no wings, no contrail and no sound.","Tags":"City"}
