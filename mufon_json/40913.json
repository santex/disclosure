No discernable shape, just the bright light. We stopped and watched it as we looked for phone cam. It was traveling in a southwesterly direction for about 30 seconds just above treetops and by the time we had camera out it had quickly faded to nothing. Was many magnitudes brighter than any stars that were just appearing in the sky. Saw a faint satellite cross over in a southerly direction about 10 mins after it was gone it was much fainter. No sound was heard , but we have seen similar objects in the same area and direction in the past. Large wind storm here yesterday causing power outages and damage. We stopped and watched for another 15 minutes and saw no other traces."],"Case Number":"40913","Date of the Event":"07/18/2012 10:01 UTC","City":"Potsdam","Summary":"Extremely bright orange glowing object with a bright white center","Region":"New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40913.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40913.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/18/2012 10:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07182012-0021","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.6708,+-74.976108(40913)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40913) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"44.6708","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
