By the time I had finished saying, \"xxxxx, look at that and tell me what you think, it was gone\". Only rational explanation was a high tech satelite dish that was in a submersable mode at the time. Felt exposed to the occurence due to the visibility range and close proximity. Closest campers were faced at a different angle around the mountain and three quarters of a mile from us."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in 11 mile","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2009 07:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18008.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18008.html"],"Log Number":"US-07102009-0018","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Summary":"Round, Gold, Hovering above Treeline","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.790308,+-105.482829(18008)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18008) map </A>"}
