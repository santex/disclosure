It was completely silent, no smoke trail. Disappeared behind group of trees, got up off chair, ran to see it emerge from behind the trees and it was gone. As a former commercial pilot and 38 year aviation expert, I can not explain what the object was. I have seen meteorites, satellites and other natural and made objects move across the sky, but not at such an extreme speed, especially without a sonic boom."],"Latitude":"53.732428","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Log Number":"CA-07012013-0018","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.732428,+-127.639641(48554)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48554) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/01/2013 08:03 UTC"}
