I first learned of it when my 10 yr old grandson ran in house shouting \"UFO, Grandma!\". So myself and 4 boys aged 3-10 all walked outside and stood 0n the corner described watching this fiery object for about 20 min. Daughter walked outside to us and said, \"Oh, it's probably a meteor\" except it wasn't moving forward or downward. After some time, it appeared to grow smaller, and then larger again, maybe it changed distance from us. But did not go higher in sky. It was not very high, maybe the height of a plane ( not jet). It was glowing, fiery. We felt very curious but as it did not do anything else, After about 20 minutes, we went back in house. No sounds."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Thick bright flame in sky, almost vertical, stationary...daylight","Date Submitted":"11/02/2012 03:06 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/03/2012 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
