Base of clouds was about 2000 feet. The object could not have been a tube-shaped balloon as it did not twist and turn in the wind. It was not moving as a missle as it was moving lengthwise through the air and not endwise. It gradually turned eastward and was out of sight behind the trees after about 2 minutes. Object kept the same height as long as it was witnessed."],"City":"Houston","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Saw a black tube moving N under the clouds that eventually turned E.
