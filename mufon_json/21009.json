As we were waiting to turn onto the loop, I noticed two columns of bright amber lights hovering beneath two aircraft. There were approximately 4 huge amber lights in each column. Just as quickly as I had noticed the lights, they faded from the top down in less than a second or two. The aircraft continued flying in what appeared to be an Eastern direction. The lights and aircraft were midway up in the sky. I see a lot of small private planes around this area. Judging by their speed and the lights on these aircraft I would say they were small private planes. The lights faded so quickly after noticing them that my wife didn't even have a chance to see them. The lights looked like a set of stadium lights turned at a 90 degree angle, except much bigger. I would guess that the lights were as big as a quarter at arms length."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Stephenville","Latitude":"32.227726","Case Number":"21009","Log Number":"US-12152009-0016","Summary":"Amber Lights Briefly Iluminated Below Two Aircraft","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Longitude":"-98.196043","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were no other sightings in Stephenville on or around December 15th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"12/15/2009 11:26 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball"}
