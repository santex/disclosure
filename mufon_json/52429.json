My girlfriend also saw it the first time. I then told my son who was in the back seat where to look when it reappeared. He first thought it may be a tower, but we quickly realized it was much too high and there was no tower anywhere. The lights were well above the nearby mountains."],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Dateland","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"11/25/2013 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52429.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52429.html"],"Case Number":"52429","Longitude":"-113.541027"}
