{"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving west on route 52, approaching Pine Bush, NY. I noticed \"something strange\" in the sky, and snapped the attached photo. I don't remember seeing the lights move or blink or anything. Fast forward to late April 2010...looking through my pictures on my cellphone, I found the pic I had taken and had completely forgotten about. I do not believe there is any \"missing time\" but can't be sure, as I have no memory other than a vague memory of seeing something strange and taking a pic, then not thinking about it until I found the pic on my phone in April... I posted the photo to a local UFO yahoo group. One of the members lightened it, and I am attaching that photo as well. I cannot explain. Thank you."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.613489","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.613489,+-74.29344(23411)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23411) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05232010-0006","Longitude":"-74.29344","City":"Pine Bush","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/23/2010 09:45 UTC","Case Number":"23411","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Lights in formation in sky","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23411.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23411_submitter_file1__225sky.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23411_submitter_file2__225skyFX.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23411.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Pine Bush","There were no other sightings in Pine Bush on or around January 31st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/31/2010 12:00 UTC"}
