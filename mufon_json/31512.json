{"Date Submitted":"09/04/2011 10:16 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family and I were having a bonfire on the beach at our cabin. Suddenly a very bright red light appeared on the northern horizon. It moved up, to the left, to the right, hovered in one place then blinked out. My husband is a pilot and we are very familiar with aircraft and their characteritistics. This was not a plane. We have several planes that fly over the lake day and night and certainly know the difference. We discussed it and were confused about what we had seen. Then it reappeared very quickly coming up over the horizon from the northeast over the lake. We witnessed the same odd movements for several minutes then it blinked out again. There was no noise and the movements were erratic and changed directions and appeared to vibrate. On July 4th 2010 we witnessed a very similiar event but after seeing it again I thought it should be reported. When we say it last year it was very late and there were no fireworks in the area. The behaviour of the light was almost identical to last night's event."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-84.642138","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Gladwin","Date of the Event":"09/03/2011 10:00 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.151209,+-84.642138(31512)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31512) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Red light, changed directions then blinked out","Log Number":"US-09042011-0014","Latitude":"44.151209","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31512.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31512.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Gladwin","There were no other sightings in Gladwin on or around September 3rd 2011"],"Case Number":"31512","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
