The \"object\" was very high up. I see a lot of planes in the area, this \"object\" was much much higher than what I am used to seeing. At first I thought it was a satellite, but realized that it was to bright of a sky to see any satellites( I know you can see them at dusk or at night, but not this time of day) It moved slowly across the sky. I went inside to get a pair of binoculars, when I came back it took me about 30 sec to find it again. It looked like it was spherical in shape and shiny metallic color. I watched it for about 7 to 8 mins before I lost it against the bright blue sky."],"Region":"California","Case Number":"12189","Date of the Event":"08/23/2008 06:35 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12189.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12189.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around August 23rd 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.059994","Summary":"The object (sphere) was high in the sky( a lot higher than normal aircraft around here that I've seen)","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Los Angeles","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08232008-0012","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
