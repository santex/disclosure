{"Latitude":"44.27662","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Summary":"Object showed up in photograph!","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11282010-0005","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn a clear day in May, a friend and I were hiking at Smith Rock Park near Redmond, Oregon. We took several photos and as you can see by the photo it was a very clear sky with little atmospheric cloud development as we were under a high pressure system at the time. We never saw the object personally. It was something we noticed in the photo only recently after enlarging it. I did see another very similar object in the same area the year before oddly enough, but didn't have a camera at that time. My experience is as a combat weather technician for the USAF and I am trained to spot and recognize all types of atmospheric phenomena as well as aircraft from around the world. The object in the photo is not a craft I recognize, nor was it visible to the naked eye. It did not show up in any other pics I took that day."],"Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-121.166911","City":"Redmond","Date of the Event":"05/11/2010 02:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26771.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26771_submitter_file1__UFOSmithRock.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26771.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"26771","Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.27662,+-121.166911(26771)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26771) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Redmond","There were no other sightings in Redmond on or around May 11th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Disc, Egg","Date Submitted":"11/28/2010 10:53 UTC"}
