There was a company of soldiers out for amorning run. We were standing in formation, and I happened to look up in the skyand saw 4 sharp points of light in a square formation. The stood still and alsodarted around in the sky at odd angles. Because of the odd angles, I knew itcouldnt be an airplane or a helicopter, because planes and helicopters cantchange angles that quickly. I was only 18 at the time (now 58), but remember itas if it was yesterday. When I saw this I mentioned it outloud to all the othersand dozens of them saw it also. Not much was said about it at the time, but Idid think the incident quite odd. Never did know what it wasit just couldnt have been a plane or gas, or balloon. This is all I remember ofthis incident from 40 years ago now.Erwin A. Siegel, Alexandria, Virginia"],"City":"Columbia"}
