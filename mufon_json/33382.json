It was in a subdivision about 100 yards from my house, flying above the road and following a car that was driving out of the subdivison. I ran outside and the UFO took a sudden and sharp right turn and flew off in the distance, but instead of just gradually getting smaller and smaller until it wasn't noticable, the UFO just disappeared after about 20 seconds of flying in the distance."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Latitude":"42.933948","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33382.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33382.html"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Longitude":"-83.621192"}
