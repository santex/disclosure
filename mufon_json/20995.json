(photos phobos 2) **alex collier claims the mars photos are orion reptiles who invaded the secret us\\gray underground bases on mars. that coincided with the ronald reagan \"alien speech\" in un). *finally mr. dean shows structures around saturn rings: a mothership some 2 000 miles long \"electromagnetic vehicle\", and a circular artificial object the size of the moon. **alex collier's testimony in earlier interviews say there are large motherships of andromedans (benevolent human-like race) to protect us from the advancing orion-draco. most likely those are the same motherships around saturn. there are ships of other benevolent human-like civilizations, like pleiadian, sirius, etc. who are here for a rescue mission if the things go too bad with the reptiles or with our own civilization. they reportedly cannot allow a large nuclear war that will spread sequences throughout our region of galaxy. *according to dr. salla, those benevolent human-like et races presented on earth, refused to cooperate with military-industrial-extraterrestrial complex run by us and grays. the high tech transfers from grey races were in exchange of bio-material of abducted humans and embyos in secret bases (dulce nm most quoted) with shocking violation of us and international laws and human rights. *the hi-tech includes gravity shielding, zero energy propulsion system, hyper-drive, stargates to mars (witnesses testify they traveled that way to mars) and possibly to nearby star systems, project looking glass, and possibly time travel on earth (not proved). some of the insiders who speak publicly, advice us to just go and browse arxiv.org (cornell university\\ lanl server) and do a search with those keywords. on scientific level that information is not even classified. i advice everyone who is really interested, to go through all video interviews of project camelot and several recent et conferences, available on youtube. much of the material is not transcribed and therefore not searchable. project camelot presents some transcripts. bibliotecapleyades have another very large database (where you could be literally flooded with all kind of theories including those of the antichrist's speaker benjamin creme). notice some of the guys are top secret and are telling us as much as they are permitted, that sometimes goes into a carefully planned disinformation even if they are 100% they are telling the truth. as it is the case with the mysterious 50 man-made stargates and the project looking glass. there is some alien tech that allows stargate travel but we do not know how much truth is there in claims of modifying different timelines. i agree with dr. salla who accepts the testimonies as 100% honest, and at the same time as carefully modified dis-information by their superiors. dr. salla's comments on bibliotecapleyades.net\\esp_autor_salla.htm or his website exopolitics.org seem to be the most balanced and prepared for an official position at the time of the official extraterrestrial disclosure. dr. wilcock sees everything from a quite different spiritual perspective. he believes in the good outcome of 2012. despite us\\gray attempts to secure themselves in fleets and abandon the rest of us on the planet in a major cataclysmic event (or perhaps invasion) they apparently could see a possible different future timelines), that is not a certainty only a probability. dr wilcock believes the 2012 galactic influence will lead to dna upgrade and higher dimensional shift. divinecosmos.com. that view is shared with collier who puts the date 2013 december. i believe everyone has a piece of information and the bigger picture is much larger than all that. one cannot pretend of a full picture of foreseeable future while ignoring the nowaday apparitions of virgin mary. i do not agree with much of the spiritual theory that those bright scientists present. it is surprising that their advanced et and science knowledge is not matched by an updated knowledge of christian religion, instead sometimes they sell us a centuries old medieval image. in the case of alex collier, the presented spirituality is actually that of andromedans, that understandably are not christians (not yet :) 'they are more advanced but they are not gods. every et race wonders how to know more god the creator'...a part of the philosophy alex collier is relating to us. i will make several entries to upload some more photos."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.784991,+-119.413912(20995)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20995) map </A>","Latitude":"36.784991","Summary":"Apollo 13 photos of 5 mile spaceship","Log Number":"US-12152009-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-119.413912","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed"}
