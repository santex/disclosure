Then I noticed a hole in the clouds the only one coming right down Blubonet st must have a 100 ft round. Just as it was right over my grandparents house we saw a round object black on the bottum with red light no sound just hanging there only got to see it for a few seconds. I will never forget it. That is not the only one I later moved to to my dads folks house I saw 16 lights one night sitting on the roof top. well all I know is there is something to all of this I dont know what or why they are here but they are . At times I feel like Im being watched it is hard to explain but I feel them at times.
