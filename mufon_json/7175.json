It was shiny and metallic, appeared to be round but it was hard to tell because it was so far away and high up in the sky. It sat completely stationary and motionless for several minutes. Suddenly, it began moving very smoothly and rapidly in, I believe, a southern direction. It appeared to be moving as quickly as a jet would, but left no jet stream. It flew in a perfectly straight line. It disappeared rapidly into the distance. I was baffled by what this object could have possibly been."],"City":"Syracuse","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.051132,+-76.140404(7175)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7175) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/31/2005 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Syracuse","There were no other sightings in Syracuse on or around May 31st 2005"]}
