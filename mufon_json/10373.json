(perhaps this is why people seem to think the thing changes colors? changes directional rotation relative to observer, or even pass them leaving them to look at it from another angle?) once again, i have battled with the thought of a helicopter or even perhaps a small aircraft but i cannot see it. the wind was gentle out of the south at about 5mph. if there was anything to hear the wind would have pushed it my way. considering the oddity of the object and the fairly quiet evening even in downtown i am confident i would have heard something... anything. no sound. there was also a passenger jet passing overhead at the same time and in the same field of view but much, much higher. back to the time of day - the passenger jet was high enough in the sky that it was still catching sunlight. i could see the shape of the jet and even a portion of its contrail. the object in question was low enough and close enough to be completely dark other than the glow of the lights. at the time of the sighting and afterwards i had no abnormal feelings. i was just really intrigued by the object. since then i have questioned myself about the altitudes and distances a few times but i am confident in my analysis and near 100% on the math. this is the fourth time in my life i have observed what, to me, was a ufo but this was probably the most significant considering i have a firm timetable and measurement process to work from. the other times all caught me off guard and two of them were before i ever joined the military and later became a land surveyor."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"04/15/2008 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Fayetteville","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.06937"}
