{"divs":["sighting detailsi came home with my girlfriend after hanging out with some friends and we were drinking. i, however, was not drunk at all. after we came home my girlfriend almost immediately went to bed. i stayed up watching t.v., since i have trouble sleeping when i drink. after a while i went outside to smoke a cigarette, and i was looking off to the south west towards kentucky. i saw this star, or at least it looked like a star, and it was moving quickly across the sky like a satellite. i have been backpacking before and seen the satellites move across the sky during dusk. so i thought it was a satellite based on how fast it was moving, but then it started to slow down. so i thought cool i'm looking at the iss (international space station). but then it started to change directions and instead of moving with the rotation of the earth it started to reverse it's pattern and pulled a 180. then i thought to myself weird, must be a test plane or a helicopter or even just a satellite changing its course. so i steadied my head against my chair and dropped my cigarette and watched it moving. then it changed its directions again, after about a minute or two, back to moving constant with the other stars around it. granted, it could have been a star and seeing it under the influence of a few beers still in my system, but then it shot forwards towards me. and this is when i was caught off guard. it came closer in a blink of an eye, and it was about and 1\\8 or 1\\4 of an inch long and was blinking different colors like a rainbow and was cigar shape. i looked at it in awe for about thirty seconds scared shitless and then just as quick as it came it disappeared to the right (west). now, i watch the history channel and so on and i watch the ufo shows, but i always try to critasize those shows looking for flaws in people's point of views or the so claimed scientists. but this legitimately scared me. i ran inside and tried to wake up my girlfriend, but she was in a deep sleep. i jumped on the internet (i know not a very good source) and found a very similar description of a ufo over deaconess hospital over cincinnati. so then, in practically tears.... i woke my girlfriend up and showed her where i saw the ufo. then i tried to go to bed. i haven't told many of my friends, because they would ridicule me, but i have told some."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/30/2008 02:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"39.112398","Date Submitted":"04/30/2008 02:30 UTC","Case Number":"13296","Log Number":"US-10282008-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13296.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13296.html"],"Region":"Ohio","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-84.50277","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar, Star-like","City":"Cincinnati","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.112398,+-84.50277(13296)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13296) map </A>","Summary":"Thought it was a satellite.
