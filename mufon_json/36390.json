It was near the area of the Toledo Express Airport in the southwest part of the sky. I watched the object and it began moving irradically up,down,side to side and I knew it wasn't a plane. I found my binoculars and looked at the object and could see a disc shaped object with the lights spinning around. I watched it approximately 5 minutes and took another look without the binoculars. When I tried to view it again with the binoculars it disappeared. March 8 the same object was appeared in the same area and I watched it for about ten minutes and it had the same lights and appearance."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36390.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36390.html"],"Latitude":"41.667468","Date of the Event":"03/07/2012 11:14 UTC"}
