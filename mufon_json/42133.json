Daughter and I got out of the car and clearly saw the object. I first thought it might be a meteorite, but the trajectory and sameness of a flight path quickly dispelled that idea. I knew that this was not space debris as the object had a clearly defined shape, although its edges we're in constant transmutation, but not severely so. Very odd. Lost sight of it as it went behind some trees, but We quickly got back into the car and turned northward to see it, but nothing there."],"Date of the Event":"08/25/2012 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"42.770648","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.770648,+-78.607049(42133)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42133) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in East Aurora","There were no other sightings in East Aurora on or around August 25th 2012"],"Object Features":"Dome","Log Number":"US-08292012-0015","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"East Aurora","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New York"}
