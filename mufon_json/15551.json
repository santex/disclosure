{"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02172009-0013","Date of the Event":"02/16/2009 09:40 UTC","Summary":"Extremely slow moving multiple bright lights with low altitude.","Latitude":"36.16734","City":"Nashville","trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There were no other sightings in Nashville on or around February 16th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsLast night at 9:40 pm (Feb. 16, 2009) Kim and I stepped out onto the deck for a few minutes before retiring for the night. We were both looking up at the stars and constellations when suddenly Kim exclaimed, ��� Look at those lights. They just suddenly turned on. All of a sudden they just came on.��� While she was talking and pointing I looked and saw three bright lights that had the appearance of powerful mercury vapor lights, which emitted a yellowish-white-orange color in a downward direction as if mounted underneath something. I was surprised at the sight because I think I have seen most aircraft light configuration, but this was strange. She said that it must be an airplane. It was moving toward us, but it was too large to be moving too slow. I told her to keep watching while I went for the camera. When I returned within ten seconds it had moved almost straight above us at about 10 -11 o���clock angle. As I started to take a shot it began to dim, and I told her that it was going to fade out��� but it: Brightened again for 2 to 3 seconds, Went out for a couple seconds, Came back on for 3 to 4 seconds, Went out again for a couple seconds, then a very dim red and green light came on and stayed on. Then I was totally confused because No. 1) This object is moving even slower than an ultra-light plane. No. 2) The on and off light sequence was atypical of common air traffic in our area. No. 3) The sudden appearance of these ominous bright yellowish lights at less than a mile away. And lastly, the fact that it had red-and-green navigation lights, not to mention there was NO SOUND at all. Kim and I both concluded that the behavior definitely was not that of an airplane. Maybe it could have been a blimp at low altitude, but it is a violation to navigate without lights. I snapped off four pictures but my digital was set at 400 ISO and the lights smeared leaving them totally useless. I resolved to believe that it was an airplane until I decided to see if any like sightings had been reported. BINGO, I found one on MUFON submitted 2-17-2009 from Ohio, which has a ���Craft.jpg��� illustration. It appears to have the same lighting and behavior that we witnessed."],"Longitude":"-86.779133","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.16734,+-86.779133(15551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15551) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15551.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15551.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Tennessee","Case Number":"15551","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/16/2009 09:40 UTC","Weather Factors":"None"}
