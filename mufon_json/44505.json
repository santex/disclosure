I looked at the sky and saw a orb of light. It looked like a beam of light at first but as i got closer it maintained a ball shape. After about 2 minutes the orb melted away and the light disappeared. The sky was dark due to the heavy rain clouds in the sky at the time. I thought that it was a beam of light coming thru the cloud cover. I know I am not the only person who saw it because there was traffic on the road at the time of this incident. After about 30 seconds the orb unmelted and reformed the reddish orange bright orb. It burned brighter for another 20 seconds before it disappeared in the sky. At that time I noticed the sky get dark again. This is extremely close to the events that happened in Ohio earlier in the today."],"Log Number":"US-12122012-0036","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44505.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44505.html"]}
