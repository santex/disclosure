{"divs":["Sighting DetailsJanuary 14th 2007 Approx 6:23pm - 6:50pm Approx 18:23 ��� 18:50 This report would made to UFOSNW on January 17th 2007. I was in Carrboro, NC at the exit ramp of Hwy 40 and hwy 86. I was casually picking a real estate sign and looking at the clear sky.Suddenly I saw something moving at what looked like the speed of a military jet. But after it travelling about 3 inches from my view it stopped in mid air. I continued to watch it and it did not fade. Instead it changed directions and started moving perpendicular, back and forth as though oscillating. It then started to make odd movements hooked shaped movements with sudden stops and reversing, then forward movements darting the eratic movements before it went futher to the right. I tried to call several friends to see. One of the first came out of her house in Durham,NC. I told her to look up and to the left of those three bright stars almost in a vertical straight line. I told her to watch that star sitting alone by itself. After a few seconds (more like 10 seconds) I asked her to tell me what she was seeing, she said the star is moving up and down. This sighting lasted around 30 minutes before it continued to my right which I think was east. and gradually faded. My friend got frightened and went back into her house. I could not tell any shape. It just looked like a star (dot) in the sky. It was clearly visible but not the brightest object in the sky. In fact it passed just below the brightest object from my perspective. I have never seen anything move as eratically not change flying directions immediately, no wide turns or anything. Just go to one way and immediately retrace its direction back. Then back and forth then move forward a little more make different motions and hook like motions and thenmove across the sky and start bouncing (oscillating movement) again until it went off to the east and faded. and not in its original direction, about 60 degrees to the left. I do not know what it was but I have never seen anything move like it."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"North Carolina","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Youngsville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.027294,+-78.48052(8883)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8883) map </A>","Log Number":"US-01152008-0028","Longitude":"-78.48052","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"01/14/2007 06:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:35:00","Latitude":"36.027294","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/14/2007 06:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8883.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8883.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"8883","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Youngsville","Summary":"STREAKING STAR LIKE OBJECT WOULD STOP AND CHANGE DIRECTIONS"}
