In the city of Birmingham,AL, when I happened to glance over my shoulder and saw what appeared to be a bright orange odd shape hovering over in the sky, it was moving in a path but barely. It was shortly before awaiting fireworks to go off, close to 9:30ish. I looked again confirming that what I was seeing was in fact real and not just meharding things, I kept a close eye on it on and off. Then one of the times I looked away and when I looked back it completely was gone as if it vanished into thin air. I have no idea what it was, but have definitely seen nothing Ike it. If anyone has witnessed the same, please post. I'd love to find out."],"Longitude":"-86.79382","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.526141,+-86.79382(40572)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40572) map </A>","City":"Birmingham","Log Number":"US-07072012-0141","Date Submitted":"07/07/2012 10:20 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Birmingham","There was one other sighting in Birmingham on or around July 4th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 09:30 UTC","Case Number":"40572","Summary":"Bright orange odd shape glow light hovering in sky, AL","Tags":"City"}
