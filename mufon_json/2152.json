{"City":"Jersey City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting Details I was living in Jersey City at the time, and I was coming from my second job at a Video store riding my bicke since it was only five blocks away and as I was one block from my house I saw out of the corner of my eyes, what I thought was a meteor, because it was coming straight down at lightning speed, so I looked up and it was like an orange fire ball when it was coming down, and when it got to I would guess 200 feet from the grownd, it stoped and thats when I saw that it wasnt a meteor, it was a flying disk and it looked like it was a meteor because it was coming down on it edge,but as it stoped it slowly began to turn right side up and thats when i saw that it was dark grey on top.then it slowly turned on it edge and I saw the bottom,it had 5 pentagon shaped lights wich covered the whole under side,they were emeral color they were aranged one in the middle and the rest around it, and then it just shot up I at a high rate of speed after being just hovering,it just accelerated so fast that my eyes could not follow it, and it did all this without a single bit of sound, thats why I know this thing was not made here all flying machines made by us make sound and none had the flying charasteristics of this thing.I stood motionless as I saw it and my tears started to come out, I dont know why, because I felt no fear at all, just an overwelming feeling of disbelief, and then admiration, but on thing that has always been in my mind was that when I first saw it coming down, I was riding my bike on Bergen ave. and I remember that as I saw it take off again I was holding my bike on Belmont ave, which was the street I lived on, I remember I stood there for about half an hour after it left, just looking up, and my tears coming out. I went home and never talked about it until a few years later, I just know that people look at you like you were on drugs when you talk about these things, so I kept my mouth shut, specially from my dad."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.728158,+-74.077642(2152)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2152) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"07/03/1992 10:18 UTC","Longitude":"-74.077642","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"40.728158","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Summary":"A Navy grey disk","Object Shape":"Disc","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"New Jersey","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Windy","Case Number":"2152","Log Number":"","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Jersey City","There were no other sightings in Jersey City on or around July 3rd 1992"],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2152.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2152.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/03/1992 10:18 UTC"}
