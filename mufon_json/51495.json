Light pulsed every 1 second. Light moved from west to east-northeast. Could not see wingtip marker lights. Commercial aircraft was observed in vicinity travelling from south to north, red strobe and wingtip markers clearly visible. Retrieved binoculars and observed object as it passed nearly overhead. Consisted of dim white or blue lights fore and aft and brighter blinking light at center. Could hear no aircraft noise. Appeared to be similar size as commercial airliner if at similar altitude (30000 - 40000 feet). Impossible to gauge actual altitude, but clearly above cloud height.
