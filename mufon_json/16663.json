I thought I was imagining it until my friend asked me if I saw it too. It was large and like nothing I have ever seen. Kind of tear drop shaped and it hovered. It was only visible for a couple of minutes and disappeared just as quick as it appeared. We searched our immediate area hoping to see it but with no luck. We did notice increased air traffic in our sky after this happened."],"Latitude":"27.983633","Log Number":"US-04252009-0001","Summary":"2 eyewitnesses saw a large object hovering.","Date Submitted":"04/24/2009 12:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/24/2009 12:00 UTC","City":"Seffner","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Teardrop, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.983633,+-82.275647(16663)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16663) map </A>","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16663.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16663.html"]}
