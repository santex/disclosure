{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAs I watched the tape I first saw a white object moving from the South to the North, no blinking lights, or any noise. As the object went off the screen at the same spot there came a flash of light like a flicker of flame but light. And it became brighter and more solid and the object rounder the 2 story house and curved around right towards the camcorder, it happened very quickly and the shape was not always the same but close, I didn't hear any noise. I had the gentlemen put it on a disc and tried to get the best shot of the object. It ended and about 2 to 3 minutes later there was another flash of light just like the first and the only thing diffrenet was that you could hear a dog barking on the tape. That about it. And just so you know the next night there was a light show of something between the 2 story houses and I also have it on tape. Which I might send if you give the disc back.
