Did not see it leave, fell back asleep. e; light","Log Number":"US-08022011-0030","Latitude":"33.75024","Date Submitted":"08/02/2011 02:19 UTC","Case Number":"30552","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-116.966818","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30552.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30552.html"],"Country":"United States"}
