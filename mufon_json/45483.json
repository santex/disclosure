After finding objects in some photos I was strangely compelled to take a few years ago, I find myself on occasion suddenly desiring to take sky photos when I notice anything different about cloud structures. I like to refer to my observations as Cumulus anomalies. The enclosed image is from a couple of weeks ago when I arrived at my workplace, and notice that the only clouds in the sky were a relatively short line in front of the sun and had very unique curls on top similar to Japanese wave paintings. I took a quick photo. Later on I pulled it up to show someone the cloud shapes I had seen and realized that none of the curls showed up at all, which was odd. In zooming in to get a better look, I noticed something right in front of the sun. It is obviously not a cloud. Anyway, I thought you might find it interesting. I am also very aware of where the lens flare is when taking shots as to keep it \"out of the shot\" in this case is was on the left side."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45483.html"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Iowa"}
