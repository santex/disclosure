I imediatly got off the first exit busted a uturn, it was gone , I even went doen the freeway to see if it moved further down ...nothing this all was around 12:25am Now I kept thinking it was a blimp but I think of the way it moved then with a quick burst of speed then to sop , na it was something I had never seen"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11127.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11127.html"],"Case Number":"11127","City":"Pasadena","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/29/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
