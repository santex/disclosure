I stopped at my car to get my jacket. I was glancing to the west down the driveway looking at Venus and Jupiter that were very bright that night. I noticed another star to the right of Venus. I thought it was pretty so i stopped to look at it for a second. Star gazing is great to do in Arizona. Anyway as i was looking at them the star to the right of Venus started to move to the north. It went very fast and as it moved it faded until it couldn't be seen. It was very bright. Almost as bright as Venus. I was sorta wierded out by it."],"Latitude":"31.601721","Date Submitted":"02/13/2012 12:52 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"McNeal","Longitude":"-109.667503","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.601721,+-109.667503(35663)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35663) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Saturn-like, Star-like","Log Number":"US-02132012-0002","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/10/2012 07:50 UTC","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35663.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35663.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"Bright light to the right of Venus begins to move fast and fades.","Region":"Arizona","Case Number":"35663"}
