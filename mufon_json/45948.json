{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Colorado","Date of the Event":"02/27/2013 07:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from the gym in Parker, Colorado on a dark long stretch of road and a bright flashing object caught my attention. The object was zig zagging across the sky at incredible speeds. It was in one position and then a split second later was miles away at a different level. I continuously observed this very odd motion for several minutes pulled over on the side of the road. The object appeared disk shaped and was definitely not an airplane because it moved from point to point instantly and there were airplanes flying in the sky for perspective."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45948.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45948.html"],"Longitude":"-104.753963","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.52011,+-104.753963(45948)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45948) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02272013-0017","Summary":"a bright flashing red and blue light emitting disk that zig zagged at incredible speeds miles at a time","Date Submitted":"02/27/2013 09:59 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Disc","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Parker","There were no other sightings in Parker on or around February 27th 2013"],"Country":"United States","City":"Parker","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"45948","Latitude":"39.52011"}
