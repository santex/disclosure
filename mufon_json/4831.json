{"Case Number":"4831","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking pictures of another thunderstorm from my roof in Anderson, trying to catch the lightning flashes. This string of multi-colored lights appeared in one picture. I didn't see it when the picture was taken and there isn't anything in that direction to explain it. It isn't caused by moving the camera since the roof in the foreground is clear. I thought it might be pearl lightning or the start of a lightning strike but I don't know what it really was."],"Longitude":"-85.683581","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.130349,+-85.683581(4831)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4831) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Lightning","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"String of lights in the sky in photo of evening thunderstorm","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4831.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4831_submitter_file1__pearls3-11-06.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4831.html"],"Date of the Event":"03/11/2006 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/11/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05222006-0005","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Anderson","There were no other sightings in Anderson on or around March 11th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.130349","Region":"Indiana","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Anderson"}
