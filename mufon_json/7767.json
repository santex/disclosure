The time was approximately 04:20 AM I was collecting my partner from his home in Golden, to begin our shift duties, there was very little light pollution up by the foothills and it was a very quiet night, while I was waiting for him to come out I was sitting on the hood of my car gazing across the foothills When I noticed what appeared to be a very bright spot light flying over the top of the mountainside, it was illuminating the foothills as it went, it was coming in my direction almost over head, there were no strobes or colored lights as usually seen on aircraft, it was totally silent, as it approached my position, I drew a small but very powerful flash light from my duty rig, I flashed a series of about 4 signals, the object stopped above me, it was the size of a 10 cent coin, it just looked like a spot light, at this point I was feeling more than a little intimidated, and I inadvertently let my hand rest on my duty weapon, and the thought was I could if need be, engage this object if it moved any closer to me, just as had this thought, I observed without even blinking an eye, the object accelerate straight up at an Immeasurable rate of speed until it reached infinity and totally disappeared, I was more than a little concerned about the sighting, I passed this information to my partner but he just discounted it as my imagination! I have never officially reported this to any one else"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Colorado","City":"Golden","Latitude":"39.765263","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"UFO Seen over Foothills of Golden Colorado"}
