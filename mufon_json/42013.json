We at first thought \"that plane is really low\" but as we stared at it for over a half hour and realized there was no sound and it was not moving started thinking of other ideas. Maybe a falling star? A UFO? We watched the light for hours, and even as the sun started to rise it was still the brightest thing in the sky. It appeared at one point to reverse and get smaller and farther away, but then got closer."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/25/2012 06:39 UTC","Log Number":"US-08252012-0015","Object Shape":"Diamond, Star-like, Other, Unknown","Summary":"BRIGHTEST light (diamond shape) in sky for hours with a glow of lines (as you get from a glare looking at headlight) around it, but the lines always remained the same, moving slow, seemed to revers, and get dimmer, smaller, then bigger and brighter."}
