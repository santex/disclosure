One dissolved and the other two continued on... heading East. There was no noise, no flashing, just balls of white light. Very peculiar as they appeared out of nowhere and they basically grazed across the sky. As a side note, I was on the phone with my Mom, in DC who just received a crystal pendulum I sent her. I didn't mention I was seeing UFOs right at that instance as not to scare her but she said, \"Natalie I just asked the pendulum if you're happy right now and it bent the chain spiraling hugely going anti-gravity ~ OMG!\" That was all I needed to know because I was very happy to see them. It's just me and Mufon's secret!"],"Summary":"3 balls of white light in formation floating across the night sky","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-88.594958"}
