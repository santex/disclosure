He called meon his cellphone, said me and Teresa and her husband are lokking at a UFO in theNW. Look out the window and see if you can see it. I saw it out the bathroomwindow, and it looked like a bright flashing star or planet. He got hope @ 10minutes later and we looked with binoculars, but they gave a blurred view. Wealso saw another one near it. They just hovered very far in the diastant sky,and @ 8:45 seemed to slowly move further away and disappear. The next night onereappeared in the same place @ 7:30PM and through a Mead telescope we saw thatit changed from all red lights to all green lights to all white lights. Theyseemed to be rotating.
