To the right about 300 feet above the treeline I saw a lead colored cigar shaped object about 500 feet in length in a steep angle decent. It was headed toward the west side of central avenue. The speed was quite fast but not so fast that I could not tell what the object was(it was not a blur). What made me believe this was a UFO was that there are no airports where the UFO was heading below the treeline on the west side of Central Avenue. The descent angle and rate would make conventional aircraft crash. I went to my rental property which was near the point where I estimate the object could have landed and saw no smoke from a fire. Anything that was out of control like something man-made would have crashed at the rate and angle of decent I witnessed. Before witnessing this event I was a non-believer in UFOs."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.449817,+-112.064367(40975)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40975) map </A>","Longitude":"-112.064367","Latitude":"33.449817","Date of the Event":"05/01/2001 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40975.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40975.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
