{"Case Number":"39880","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was hanging out by my pool in my back yard. I had gotten out of the pool and was laying on the concrete on my back. This is when I noticed the object. At first I thought it was a plane. But then I noticed that the color was an illuminated sort of white almost transparent like color. I've never seen a plane that looked like that. So I continued to watch it. Oh it was more like a triangle shape too. It seemed to be going very fast. It crossed quite a distance in a short amount of time. It was also very high in the sky so that it looked small. I don't really know how big it was. I've never seen a plane that high before either. It also didn't leave a trail like planes do. There was no sound either. I was saying to myself what the hell is that. I was pretty excited. Then the object just disappeared right before my eyes."],"trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Mishawaka","There was one other sighting in Mishawaka on or around June 27th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.155596","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/27/2012 07:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06282012-0003","Summary":"Observed a triangle shape very high inthe sky.
