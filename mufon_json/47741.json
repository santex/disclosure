I went outside to look at it and saw an orange bright light traveling at a high, steady speed over the Hood Canal in the direction of Bremerton or Seattle. It was traveling too fast to be anything artificial like a plane and too slow to be meteore or rocket. We saw a total of about 5 or 6 and they would come every 5 minutes or so. It was only one at a time and they would travel form the farthest we could see toward us then disappear as they were just in front of us. There was cloud cover so I don't think the objects were any higher than around 1500 ft. I have seen multiple UFOs in the past and this seemed to me to be another sighting."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"47.454279","Log Number":"US-05302013-0014","Date of the Event":"05/25/2013 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Belfair","There were no other sightings in Belfair on or around May 25th 2013"],"Region":"Washington"}
