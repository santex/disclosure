I was aboutto go inside when I saw what i thought was a very large meteor burning up. I sawan orange flare suddenly appear in the sky but instead of burning up it sloweddown and I could see it was orange, glowing, and elongated. Kinda like acylinder or cigar. I yelled What the hell is that and I must have sounded upsetbecuse the woman with me looked up and asked if it as an airplane and I told herI saw it enter the atmosphere and if it was a plane wed only see lightsblinking. We watched it until it was too far away to see and it flew south in aslow slower then even a single prop plane curving zig zag. It just slowly wentfrom left to right as it went forward. My hearts still racing. Ive seen a lot ofstrange lights out here in the past, but this is the first time I actually saw ashape."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Case Number":"2248","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Between Gainesvile Arche","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Orange, elongated object moving south","Log Number":"","City":"Between Gainesvile Arche","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.667477,+-81.510634(2248)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2248) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2248.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2248.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/22/2003 08:53 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Other,Unknown","Latitude":"27.667477","Date of the Event":"04/22/2003 08:53 UTC"}
