So I thought it was orange because it was nearing sunset and the sun was bright orange,so I looked to my left to see if the sun was above the tree line( which would explain why the object was orange) or below the tree line,then I looked to my right and the object had vanished.I scanned the sky around us and it was gone.There were no clouds in the sky at that moment and it just disappeared.The sun was above the tree line,we were on the highway.It took maybe 4 or 5 seconds when I looked away from the object on my right side ,to look on my left side to see if the sun was above the tree line or not,and then look back to the right to look at the object again,but it had vanished.This was only the 4th daytime sighting I have had,but have had many nightime sightings over the years since 1991.I have reported every sighting to HBCC,but now they don't operate anymore and this is why I am using MUFON.Since that sighting ,my husband and I have had several sightings.We feel fortunate for all the \"shows\"."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Moncton","There were no other sightings in Moncton on or around June 11th 2010"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/11/2010 09:02 UTC"}
