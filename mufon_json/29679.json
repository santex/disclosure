I saw a bright white object that looked like a fat missle (like from WWII) aiming down at a 45 degree angle. It had a skinny tail on top of it at a 120 degree angle. It moved across the sky kind of like a plane would, but it was moving in a very straigt, smooth path and flying very low. I was surprised to see a plane that low in this area. I'd guess that it was at about 500- 1,000 feet but don't know for sure. It was cloudy out with dark clouds in the Eastern sky where I was looking so the object really stood out. It moved behind trees and I couldn't see it after that. I'd like to know what it was. After that, I headed home (West) on 23rd Street. I was at 291 Highway and 23rd street and noticed a very strange cloud hanging low over an area around Noland Road. It was low and black with sharp edges and a few puffy black clouds around it that were all the same size. It looked very odd - I've never seen anything like it. It stayed there the entire time I was driving."],"trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There were no other sightings in Independence on or around June 21st 2011"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/21/2011 06:14 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Region":"Missouri","Date Submitted":"06/22/2011 05:30 UTC","City":"Independence","Latitude":"39.096116"}
