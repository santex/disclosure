I was on the computer at my home on the suburbs of Ponta Delgada in the island of S���o Miguel (Azores). My mother went to open the door of our house when she noticed a strong light over a mount some miles away. Immediatly she called me and I went to see it. At first I thought it was an emergency flash light but then it started moving in different directions until it disapeared during few seconds. Then it appeared again for a little bit and then disappeared completely. The object was kind of oval shape, very bright white light."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"22294","Country":"Portugal","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ponta Delgada","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City"}
