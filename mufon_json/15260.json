Low in sky. Lights indicated a somewhat circular shape and were not quite flashing but would get brighter and then appear to become more pronounced. The way they gave off light was not like lights from a plane in the sense that they did not flash but merely got brighter at times. Lights, perhaps 6-8, were white mostly and there was red light on one side and perhaps a green light on other side. Was not a plane- this was lateral in the sense of the position of lights- moved collectively and slowly, deliberately toward HB area. This was viewed in north Orange County. I watched for 2-4 minutes as craft disappeared. Time was 3-3:04AM. This was not a plane or helicopter- grouping of lights indicated a laterally wide or perhaps oval shape. No sound."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/02/2009 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"33.92656","Longitude":"-117.89203","City":"Brea","Case Number":"15260","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Brea","There were no other sightings in Brea on or around February 2nd 2009"],"Tags":"City"}
