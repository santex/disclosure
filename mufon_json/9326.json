No noise the sky was clear no rain or clouds. It was not a helicopter or aeroplane i am positive of that The light i seen seemed to be on a dark object but could not make it out properly as the light revolving around it took my attention for the 10 seconds or so i seen it. It was heading in the direction of a transmitter mast on a area called the Black Isle in Inverness-shire Scotland. When i started to try and type what i had seen i found it very difficult to type properly i thought there was something wrong with my keyboard i couldn't realy understand what i had seen and then try and put it into words, i felt a bit odd to be honest any ideas thanks Ian calderwood"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","Region":"Scotland","Date Submitted":"01/27/2008 09:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=57.479573,+-4.221121(9326)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9326) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United Kingdom"}
