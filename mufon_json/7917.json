(semi professional photographer) it is loaded with 100asa b\\w kodak 120 roll film, i took 6 shots of the orbs with a 150mm lens. the aperture was set at f16, 125th\\second and focus to infinity. the film is still in the camera right now and is not yet developed. i managed to get a lamp post in the shot for \"reference\" the orbs were about 200-300meters high all moving in the same direction. i would have to guess their size to be about 1-2meter in diameter each. each was moving independantly, some up, some down at varying degrees. they were not rising to higher altitude but rather along the same plane of altitude. we watched for about ten minute and boarded another train to wimbledon. they were still visible yet further away. thats it for now, will get the film developed and see."],"trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around September 15th 2007"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"England","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
