Since there were few stars viable, I looked as we sat there and saw the light, and confirmed to him indeed it was a satellite as it was a bright light moving slowly over the concert area from south to north. The light then zigzagged in a \"Z\" fashion and moved fasted to the east and the light dimmed and finally extinguished prior to the horizon. We had watched planes before sundown and this was not in the flight pattern of other planes we had been watching previously, and don't believe that a helicopter to have made such rapid moves, nor would have had such a bright light. People behind me (none of us under the influence of drugs or alcohol) all thought it an unusual occurrence."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"07/25/2009 09:30 UTC","Case Number":"18321","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.063596,+-94.882245(18321)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18321) map </A>","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Region":"Kansas","Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.882245","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18321.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18321.html"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.063596","Date of the Event":"07/25/2009 09:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Bonner Springs","Summary":"Bright light, thought it was a satillite.
