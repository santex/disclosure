{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-85.25168","divs":["Sighting DetailsCamping at Fisherman's Island near Charlevoix, Michigan September 6th, 2012. Clear night. No moon, We went down to the beach to see the Lake Michigan and the Milky Way on the first night of the trip. I think I had a beer but my girlfriend did not drink. Looking west we saw a white light that seemed maybe like a satellite as it seemed to be reflective light. It was west and moving toward the horizon diagonally slightly to the north starting at about 60 degrees. It then faded away near 45 degrees. Near where it first appeared a small flash and then nothing. Not used to seeing satellites from this trajectory and short duration. Moved too slow for a meteor in my opinion. The white flash was small, all in one spot, had no streak or movement and only happened once. Overall, a very quick event, 10 seconds, but hoping someone else may have seen it as well. As of now it was just viewed by me an my girlfriend."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.322463,+-85.25168(42623)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42623) map </A>","Latitude":"45.322463","Case Number":"42623","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Michigan","Summary":"light from up to down then a separate flash up high.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Charlevoix","Date Submitted":"09/17/2012 10:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/06/2012 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42623.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42623.html"],"Log Number":"US-09172012-0006","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Charlevoix","There were no other sightings in Charlevoix on or around September 6th 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
