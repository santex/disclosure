Noticed that this particular one seems to be getting a lot of attention lately. It's the triangular orangish lights. I've been seeing them quite often May-June of this year, 2011. They can interchange with each other appearing to be disconnected, and sometime beam bright and then disappear. I like them, and enjoy seeing them. :)"],"Case Number":"29781","Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06292011-0009","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Orange triangle of lights","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.551421","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/26/2011 12:00 UTC","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"06/29/2011 04:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29781.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29781.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.551421,+-105.772177(29781)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29781) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON"}
