{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWas setting here drinking coffee and heard the noise. Having seen 3 black triangulars years ago, I went out on the deck to investigate. Sure enough, two black triangulars, flying northeast over my property; pretty high in the sky. They were moving slowly; and not flying fast at all. Their propulsion sounded like a rumble, and they had flashing lights on each corner of them. I never have a camera when these things happen, but that makes 5 black triangulars I have seen in the past 10 years."],"Region":"West Virginia","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-81.098292","Country":"United States","Latitude":"37.370709","Summary":"Two Black Triangulars, Flying in Formation","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/10/2013 05:54 UTC","Case Number":"50730","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Date of the Event":"09/10/2013 05:45 UTC","City":"Princeton","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50730.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50730.html"],"Log Number":"US-09102013-0007","Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.370709,+-81.098292(50730)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50730) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Princeton","There were no other sightings in Princeton on or around September 10th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
