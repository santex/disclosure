{"divs":["Sighting DetailsNot a UFO sighting but a UFL (unidentified flash of Light) So bright it was like the sun came out for 1 more second at 9:20PM in Tucson. I called the local news and reported it, they said that several other people witnessed the same thing. My buddy (Leo) was outside with me and said \"if i didn't see it myself, I wouldn't have believed you\" (he's very skeptical) My wife was kicking back with us on the back porch and I was facing south toward Davis Monthan Air Force Base but I would say that this light seemed to come from above or at least to my north. (not from the base) My wife was facing north and did not see this event. There was no noise related to the event even after waiting to hear something like an explosion. Not a cloud in the sky for as far as the eye could see. the news came on 40 minutes later and doplar radar showed no cloud in the sky for at least 60-80 miles. Again, not a UFO sighting but an unexplained light event."],"Log Number":"US-06242009-0008","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.224483,+-110.919219(17643)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17643) map </A>","Case Number":"17643","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There was one other sighting in Tucson on or around June 23rd 2009"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/23/2009 09:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-110.919219","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/23/2009 09:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Tucson","Latitude":"32.224483","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17643.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17643.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"The Tucson sky lit up, like the sun came out for 1 second.
