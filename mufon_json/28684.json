I say that because the object made no noise. I was fourteen or so and my family lived on the top floor of a duplex. We had a balcony that overlooked the street and gave us a good view of the sky. Perhaps it was the light that drew me out to the balcony. I really cannot say. When I looked to the sky, I saw a ring of lights. The object moved as slowly as a helicopter might have yet made no sound. I say \"the lights\" because it was not a solid ring. There were many individual lights that comprised the ring. The diameter of the ring was not large. As well, it was at the most, some 200ft above us. Most of the streets residents came out as well. There were perhaps 20 persons. It traveled slowly from north to south and then disapeared over the low horizon. The next day no one would speak of it."],"Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.529752,+-122.669357(28684)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28684) map </A>","Longitude":"-122.669357","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"45.529752"}
