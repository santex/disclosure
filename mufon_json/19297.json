(same as i seen in the year of 1966) my boyfriend was in my house and heard the boom also. then 3 weeks later 5\\11\\07, i and another person had a small ship fly very slowly approx. 50 feet above our heads at the establishment where we work. note !!... at around that time period, i was wishing that i would see a ufo again before i die.(wishes do come true) i thought this because my nephew who was in the navy observed and reported a red light over the smoke stacks at puget sound in wa state march 2007. (my nephew was contacted by peter davenport of nuforc and it was listed as a creditable sighting on the main page of that website.) as far as this 5\\11\\07 incident goes, my navy nephew commented that the government would not have aircraft flying over massillon ohio. maybe our government is capable of making such airships.. but i can't believe a glowing ball suspended in mid air or floating and just disappearing in front of your face! someday, the truth will be known to all. we are being watch over .. ...we need to be! i am on the ufo sites everyday. thanks to all who do report their truthful sightings. god bless. live long and prosper!"],"Log Number":"US-09132009-0015","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.799184,+-81.514619(19297)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19297) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ohio","City":"Massillon","Date Submitted":"09/13/2009 02:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.799184","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19297.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19297.html"],"Longitude":"-81.514619","Tags":"City"}
