{"Summary":"Star Like- Bright and Disappeared","Longitude":"-105.777747","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe are a married couple in our 20's with a small child and on our way home from Hugo, CO. My wife noticed a bright light toward the south west as the sun was setting. Judging by the size it was halfway between us and Pike's Peak far off in the distance. It was a white circular light that looked almost like a star. There were no clouds in the sky. Over the course of fourty five seconds it became brighter, dimmed out and then reappeared. A few seconds later it vanished completely. It did not move in the sky. About two minutes later we noticed a second object appear in the western sky. It was the same light we had seen previous. However this time the light did not brighten intensely. It appeared and vanished within 30 seconds with the same star like characteristics. Within 5 minutes, I counted 5 jet contrails in the sky near where the first sighting occured. Another contrail was spotted near the second sighting."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44998.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44998.html"],"trends":[],"Case Number":"44998","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.557811,+-105.777747(44998)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44998) map </A>","Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.557811","Date of the Event":"01/03/2013 04:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"01/03/2013 07:47 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01032013-0032","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
