{"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"06/24/2009 09:40 UTC","Object Features":"Wings","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking through a suburban neighborhood at mid-morning when I saw in the sky what I at first took for a hawk, although its coloring did not match any raptors that live in this part of the world. It had a white body and black wings. It was circling in the sky in the manner of a hunting raptor, but as I watched I realized that it was made of metal, as it flashed each time it reached the easternmost point of its circle, closest to the sun, which was still in its rising arc. As it reached the westernmost part of its circle, it would fade partially from view. It remained circling in the same spot for around five minutes, until I reached a vantage point from which I would be able to view it better, at which point it ceased to circle, flew off towards the northwest, and vanished. While I was watching I was very excited and curious and happy that I was having a mysterious experience, but after the object vanished I felt frightened when I realized I had seen something I was at a complete loss to explain."],"Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"17810","Summary":"Metal object circling in sky.","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.653035,+-104.98544(17810)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17810) map </A>","Longitude":"-104.98544","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-07052009-0015","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17810.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17810.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Englewood","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Englewood","There were no other sightings in Englewood on or around June 24th 2009"],"Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"39.653035","Date Submitted":"06/24/2009 09:40 UTC"}
