I was staring up and directly in my viewdropped an object, I noticed it straight away. I thought the object wassuspicious because of the way that it just dropped into view. the object droppedin, and paused, then moved quickly west to east, slowed down and jolted southeast. It throbbed in size i dont know whether it was an abrupt altitude changeor the actual obect changed in size.
