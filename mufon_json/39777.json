I thought I saw one of the satellites and I started to watch it. I noticed it was a lot brighter than the stars, planets and what I remember the satellites being. It was a clear night, approx 9pm local time late September 2006. The object was at about 75-80* from the horizon and had faint pink and blue hues to its white glow. I could tell the object was really high up, higher than planes fly. Initially the object was moving slowly and steadily to the west bit then dramatically and quickly changed direction to the north east. It contined going left to right between NE,E,SE,SW,W,NW. I observed it for about a minute before it started to dissapear, seemingly flying out of the atmosphere slightly to the NNE, before vanishing from sight. This object was quick and very large and was also at a very high altitude."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"2.8","Country":"France","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Ãle-de-France","Date of the Event":"09/30/2006 09:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Disneyland Paris","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"39777","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","City":"Disneyland Paris","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"06/24/2012 02:28 UTC"}
