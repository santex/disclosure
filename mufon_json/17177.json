{"Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"17177","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile having a family campfire and sky watching, noticed to the North-West of my location a very bright light that dimmed after around 3 seconds, then a second bright light,a distance away from the first brightened for around 3 second and then dimmed. The lights were much brighter than plane landing lights and much higher altitude. It appeared the lights were moving away so I thought nothing more about it. About 3 minutes later, I looked directly overhead, and saw a very bright single white light, about as big as a dime at arm length. The light dimmed and then I noticed two lights following each other about two inches apart, at arm length. The lights were on the same course from the initial sighting moving South East, slightly faster and about the same brightness as a satellite and at a high altitude. My 23 year old daughter, whom is in pharmacy college, also witnessed the two lights overhead. She claimed to have witnessed the lights start to rotate around each other, I did not witness this. They continued toward the South-East into high cloud cover."],"Date of the Event":"05/22/2009 09:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.590075,+-79.559793(17177)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17177) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.590075","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.559793","Object Features":"None","City":"Apollo","Date Submitted":"05/22/2009 09:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Apollo","There were no other sightings in Apollo on or around May 22nd 2009"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17177.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17177.html"],"Log Number":"US-05262009-0020","Summary":"Two star like lights moving in formation.","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
