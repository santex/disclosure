The fall was very slow and not like any typical meteor or flare I have witnessed before. The descent was slow. From my initial sighting at approximately 60-70 degrees above the horizon until it disappeared at 4-5 degrees above the horizon was 2-3 seconds. The object was large (about half the size as my pinkie fingernail) an very bright. The color was similar to a green traffic signal light. It left no obvious trail and fell in what appeared from my vantage point to be a nearly straight down fall. The light did not fade or diminish in anyway but rather simply disappeared at 4-5 degrees above the horizon."],"Date Submitted":"05/18/2013 12:32 UTC","City":"Keenesburg","Longitude":"-104.583841","Object Shape":"Fireball","Log Number":"US-05182013-0003","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/17/2013 09:47 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Keenesburg","There were no other sightings in Keenesburg on or around May 17th 2013"]}
