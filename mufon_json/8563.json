{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI had fallen asleep one night in the summer and had at that time had a big interest in UFO's. As I slept, I suddenly felt awakened by some strange feeling and sound. It was early around 1:00 a.m. As I laid in my bed I felt a numb feeling as though I couldn't move. I thought I was having some kind of seizure but I wasn't. I struggled to move but couldn't. After a while I managed to get to my knees and look out the window. I saw a large object hoveing above the ground in the back yard(about 2 feet above the ground). I saw several lights blinking on and off around it's edge in the colours of purple, orange, white and yellow. The object was silver in colour with no obvious windows. I thought I was dreaming and laid back down. However, I woke again about an hour after the experience and felt as though my experience was real. I was afraid to look out the window. I knew that the experience had been real regardless of who believed me."],"Latitude":"45.42709","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-12072007-0002","Date Submitted":"08/31/1986 12:00 UTC","Region":"Ontario","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Ottawa","There were no other sightings in Ottawa on or around August 31st 1986"],"Country":"Canada","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Ottawa","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.42709,+-75.693973(8563)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8563) map </A>","Longitude":"-75.693973","Date of the Event":"08/31/1986 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8563.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8563.html"],"Summary":"A large object disk shaped with multiple coloured lights around it's perimiter","Case Number":"8563"}
