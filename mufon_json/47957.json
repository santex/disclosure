I motioned to the other two passengers to look out the window to see the unusual light as well and it appeared to multiply to about 10-15 bright glowing red lights that were in a string formation in a horizontal fashion from east to west. We pulled into the taco bell parking lot on 87th near zarda bbq and holy land caf��� to try and film the lights. I pulled out my iphone 4s and tried to film the bright lights and they would not show up on the screen. At that exact time it was as if they knew I was trying to film and in a harry potter sort of way disapperated into thin air. What I mean to say is that they blinked out. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I am a very credible person as I work in the clinical medical field, with a background in science. I just thought you guys would be interested in this and we are currently at 10:05pm central time headed out to Shawnee Mission park on the top of OGG road to see if we can see anymore lights as it is the best vantage point in the area. Please let me know if you uncover anything in regards to what we saw."],"City":"Lenexa","Latitude":"38.978914","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.978914,+-94.727732(47957)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47957) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47957.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47957.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/07/2013 11:09 UTC","Case Number":"47957","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lenexa","There was one other sighting in Lenexa on or around June 7th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/07/2013 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Hovering Red LIghts in a String Formation","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
