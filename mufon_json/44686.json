We stopped the truck and started recording the lights on our cell phones. We had no idea what these red lights were. We had never seen anything like that before. We were pretty freaked out by them. There was also another vehicle stopped and watching these red lights. The man in the other car said to my brother and I \" I'm so glad you guys are seeing this too because nobody would believe me if I told them what I was seeing\". These red circular lights were hovering above the trees for about 40 seconds and when they started heading towards the sky, they would disappear and reappear until they finally disappeared way up into the sky. I have this event recorded on my cell phone."],"Longitude":"-74.647942","Case Number":"44686","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New Jersey"}
