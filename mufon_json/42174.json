At first I thought it could be a star or planet, but no other star's were seen, Being that the sky was already light due to the sun rising. The light from it was constant for the first 4 minutes that I observed it. My thoughts that it was a star or planet changed when it gave off a burst of bright white light and increased in size for a moment. It then started to gradually fade out until it was gone. It never moved from it's location in the sky and I heard no noise from the object. I wish I had a camera with me to capture this object, but I don't even own a cell phone so I was left just observing it by eye."],"City":"Palmyra","Summary":"Starlike Object with burst of light","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"42174","Latitude":"40.317843","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.317843,+-76.549016(42174)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42174) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/31/2012 06:16 UTC"}
