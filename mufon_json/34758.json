The sky diving club was jumping today, which they do often, the airport is just down the road. As I was watching them come down I saw what looked like the top of a big white ball hiding in the pine trees. After about 30 seconds it stated to rise above the trees and started to slowly move southwest. As the white ball, it looked like a 15 foot ball, got over or almost over Williamston it shot up and was gone in a blink. The UFO made no noise at all and for whatever reason as far as I know that was the last time they jumped at this airport."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"White ball ascent above trees went south west over Williamston then shot up and was gone.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34758.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34758.html"]}
