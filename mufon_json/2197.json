I did not hear any soundscoming from it. It happened so quickly that I was left wondering what it couldhave possibly been. Within a few seconds or so, 3 additional craft in atriangular formation passed over head at a high rate of speed but not nearly asfast as the first object. What happened next was really breathtaking. Anotheraircraft presumably the first one I witnessed approached the formation at a veryhigh rate of speed. It stopped its rate of speed on a dime to join the formationof the others."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.093107,+-80.604639(2197)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2197) map </A>","Object Features":"Wings"}
