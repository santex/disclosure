It was one red light on the left and two white lights to the right. All solid no flashing. Lights seemed connected. They hovered in the same exact spot for about 45 seconds. The seemed to start moving forward very slowly until they passed by our position. We pulled a U -turn to see where the lights were headed and followed them for about 5 seconds before they shot east at an extremely fast speed. We have never seen anything move quite like it. We both agree it was definitely not a standard aircraft. It was very low to the ground and moved in an extremely irregular fashion. Hoping someone else saw it as well. No other aircraft visible in sky at time of sighting."],"Region":"Tennessee","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05252011-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29236.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29236.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
