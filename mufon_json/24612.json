{"Case Number":"24612","Tags":"City","City":"Taneytown","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailslight #1:(appears every night - if it is raining or cloudy i can't see it) around 9pm -- out back in the sky is a light that seems to me like it is trying to blend in with the stars. it is way brighter than a star. it is lower than the stars too. it moves from behind our home to farther away where you can't see it anymore. when it moves it goes very slow, like it is trying to be undetected. it moves back and forth as it is moving forward. by 10:30pm you can't see it anymore. light #2: (appears every night- if it is raining or cloudy i can't see it) around 11pm - 12pm (haven't pinned down the time yet) but the second light starts off in a distance, you can just see it over the houses. it comes from the direction of westminster. as it is moving toward our direction it moves slowly and shifts back and forth like the other light. it gets brighter as it gets closer. i have not watched this one till it disapears. other lights: a few days ago i noticed something stranger. i was standing out on my front porch and there was a bright light in the sky above me. as i looked up it dimmed. it was up with the stars. it was moving across the sky very quickly, i lost site of it as it went over the house. (this was not a plane!!!- the lights i am talking about are not planes!!!) i kept watching the sky that night and i saw another one ahead of me, again up in the stars, it looked like a star moving. as it passed some stars, those stars got brighter and dimmed again. then it disappeared. then i saw another one moving to the left, again it looked like a star and was high up with the stars. i went out back to see if i could see them better look, i saw yet another one and it was headed right for a star within a cluster of stars, but then that star shifted to the left to let it go by and after it passed the star went back in place. then another one in the cluster started going in the opposite direction. i saw more out front that night - i saw a total of 10 of these things. they were there for maybe a minute each time i saw them, they were moving fast, and they weren't moving exactly straight, they moved back and forth a little as they moved. these lights were alot higher than the first 2 i listed above. i have taken pics of the first 2 lights i described, but my camera doesn't have a good zoom so it just looks like i took pics of the night sky. i have also looked at them thru a telescope and can't get focused on them cause its just a cheap telescope that doesn't zoom in on things. if someone needs to contact me to further investigate this, that is fine. i do not want to be on the news etc. thank you. answers to your questions on the left: 1. i was home and i went outside to smoke a cigarette and\\or walk my dog. 2. i noticed the #1 & #2 light because it was so bright, i watched them (at different times) and realized they was moving. the other lights - the first one i noticed caught my attention because it was bright and moving and up with the stars. 3. the first thought that came into my mind when i saw the other lights, is that they were ufo's, when i saw the lights #1\u0002 i thought they were ufo's or possibly some hush hush military stuff. 4. #1 & #2 are bright lights low in the sky, they shift back and forth as they move slowly across the sky. the other lights are dim like the stars and are extremely high up and do blend in with the stars, they move fast and slightly back and forth. 5. i watched them, then i would tell someone to come out and look to, to make sure they were seeing what i was seeing. it creeped me out but i am curious at the same time. i watch the skies every night. 6. #1 i loose sight of it when it moves far off, can't see it passed the houses. #2 i haven't lost sight of it, it is out there when i go to bed. the other lights move quick and dim out and i can't see them any more, go over the house out of my sight or they just dissapear. 3."],"Date Submitted":"07/18/2010 01:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-07182010-0004","Latitude":"39.657877","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.657877,+-77.174428(24612)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24612) map </A>","Region":"Maryland","Date of the Event":"07/17/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Other","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Summary":"Lights in ky.","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Taneytown","There were no other sightings in Taneytown on or around July 17th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24612.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24612.html"],"Longitude":"-77.174428","Weather Factors":"None"}
