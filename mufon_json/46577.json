Close to landing but still fairly high, cars were visible but small on the ground. I saw, looking down from above, a spherical object in the air above the ground, it was a light gray or brown colour, and either had markings or structural elements in a different shade. There were no lights, maybe a faint glow. I can't be sure of the size, it was not large. I can���t be sure if it was moving itself as the plane flew past it. I only saw it for a few seconds. I noticed it as it was fairly close, and realized in was not on the ground, the plane fly past it."],"Log Number":"US-04032013-0015","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46577.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46577.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/03/2013 07:37 UTC"}
