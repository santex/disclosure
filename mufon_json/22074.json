I wanted to get a picture of the rides at Cedar Point Amusement Park across Lake Erie as they are visible from there. I zoomed the camera to its 3x max, and used the hightest density setting and took the attached picture. I just wanted to see how it would turn out. Later that day, when I downloaded it to my computer and started looking at all the different things I had catured, I found an object in the sky that I can't identify. When you compare in how much detail you can spot sea gulls and boats, its hard to imagine that the object in the sky just to the right of the sea gull is anything other than what is classically described as a UFO. I'm wondering what your opinion is."],"Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"US-03012010-0008"}
