I looked down the Alsea River towards Ocean and I noticed a very,very bright light in the sky.It was not moving. I watched it for about 5 minutes I thought it might be a Coast Guard helicopter but it was'nt moving.I woke up my Daughter to come outside.I told her put a coat because it was very cold that night. She saw the light also, she watched it for about 3 minutes, and Holy **** it's a UFO. After she went inside I stayed outside about 2 more minutes, I went back inside to call my Husband. That is when i realized it had moved because I could no longer see it from under my deck. We walked out to the middle of the drive way my Husband and I watched it.While we were watching it I thought I saw it move towards the right but my Husband said no it did not move. He went back inside and I stayed outside still watching it. The light was losing its brightness. It looked light it was fading."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.311231,+-124.104842(23827)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23827) map </A>","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Yachats","There were no other sightings in Yachats on or around June 17th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-124.104842","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cross, Oval","Latitude":"44.311231","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-06192010-0005","Summary":"Cold, clear night west of Waldport, Oregon looked like over the bay.","Country":"United States","Case Number":"23827","Date of the Event":"06/17/2010 10:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/19/2010 09:27 UTC"}
