All the lights were off and the blinds were open, and I saw what I thought was a military plane, so I looked again, and saw that it was getting dimmer, then brighter, then turning into a disk shape. ( this is looking south from north. Towards the Seattle metro area.) It started moving left ( or east) and disappeared. Another one showed up shortly after out of no where, and another appeared after that, they would get dim, then bright, then turn into orange 'saturn shapes'. After that, they would turn into a dim ball again, and disappear, then one would reappear. After there was one, another would appear, so there were 2, then they both just disappeared."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29077.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29077.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Washington","Case Number":"29077","Latitude":"47.998276"}
