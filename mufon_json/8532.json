I ran in to get my binoculars (two pairs). My friend and I (and a passerby) all saw the same thing hovering above the southeastern sky above the Atlantic Ocean. I live not far from the beach so figured it to be over the water. It did not look like another star, nor did it look like a satellite and was not moving at all. We all just stared at it in wonder for a good 15 or 20 minutes until my neck got tired from looking up. I just wanted to report it. My feelings are that it was definitely a UFO. I compared it to stars around it in the sky and it was definitely different and had many colors that seemed to twinkle like christmas tree lights."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.283103,+-80.35074(8532)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8532) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Port St Lucie","There were no other sightings in Port St Lucie on or around December 2nd 2007"],"Region":"Florida","City":"Port St Lucie","Latitude":"27.283103","Date of the Event":"12/02/2007 10:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
