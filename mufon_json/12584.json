(1978 or, 1979). i had the summers off for a few weeks every early july (model change from gm) and that is the only reason i can associate the time with july. sorry. i was with a freind in the pool by ourselves and i was reaching up from under the dive board hanging on as we just floated enjoying the warm night air. i noticed a helocopter comming down the beach (daytona)at a slow rate of speed with a huge spotlight pointing down at the beach. it was the bright kind like you would see at an event where they shine spot lights into the air to attract people from many miles away. the light was not quite that large though, only as bright. i remember thinking that they were probably looking for people parked on the beach but that was not illegle. i also thought that maybe they were looking for couples laying on the beach making love or something. it was not like the police to make a big deal of that though would it? i wondered to myself. as the craft came closer i could only guess the distance with a certain amont of accuracy untill it got so close that the angle in relation to the ocean edge made it easy to judge. once it got approximately 80 to 90 yards it stopped for 5 -10 seconds. i cant remember what had been discussed between my freind and i to this point in time in the incident. at that point (about 5 to 10 seconds) the craft made a flare of light similar to a fireworks explosion except that eventhough the light went in all directions, it didnt go as far as a big fireworks display. maybe similar to seeing a firewoorks go off from a mile or two away. small but we know it was right in front of us. close. (80 to 90 yards) as i mentioned before , the angle was greater to the beach edge and as it got closer you cold tell that it was almost between us and the beach edge (tide). the pool we were in was about 100 or 125 yards from the water so as it got closer, you could judge easily. (especially with the spot light right there) at any rate, now as it made this fireworks -like lightfor maybe one second it vanished and stoped out over the sea about 4 or 5 miles out and hovered. (no sound) now it was just a big light but you could tell that it was now out over the sea about 4 or 5 or 6 miles but it took less than 1 second to get there from the beach with no sound ! i couldnt tell you if my freind and i looked at each other at this point and said wow ! or what! but it had hoverd about 3 or 4 seconds and did that little fireworks type light thing again and disapeared. i can distinctly remember that as i looked at my freind the first thing i thought was that 'who would beleive this' and before i could finish asking what do we do? who do we talk to , my freind said \"who would believe us anyway\" and this i remember because it is the same thing that i was thinking as she said it to me! it is that reason and that reason only that i can so distinctly remember this conversation. i could probably draw an example of the sighting but it is hard to explain in text. i had not spoken to anyone about this for many years and the freind and i had not discussed this matter to anyone that i know of between then and the time we had gone our seperate ways as freinds. at one point i had asked my father (passed on) about his feeling because he was a very logical and technical type person who had an answer for everything. i thought he would be the one to ask. he explained in our breif discussion that they now have experimental helocopters with jet engines on them that make them fast and agile. that was as good as his explanation got. this is a good one i thought as he never gets stumped. i was apprehensive in the first place to talk about this stuff and didnt want to argue that i couldnt hear this thing make any noise from less than 100 yards. he may have considered my remark a provocation for an argument. he was an ornery old coot. the subject was dropped at that point partly to avoid further embarassment on my part. john p.s> see attachments \\ drawings."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09182008-0005","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"No good look at the craft itself but only of the light from it.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"12584"}
