When my mom called me outside to our balcony we live on the 3rd floor. When i came outside i seen a green light ascend from the the tree line to above my apartment and it headed straight over head of I and my mom, we noticed it had a green light with white around it.���I got exited and wanted to see another so i sat with my mom for 10min until i see a star-like ufo split into 2 and head in seperate directions at a very high rate of speed, i was looking at 1 of them and i see another start flying with it. I watched until they passed overtop my building. I was amazed by how many were actually in the sky but were acting as stars after this sighting i believe there must thousands or maybe millions of ufos in the skys every night. I have seen 3 ufos before this, I believe i've never been abducted, but im baffled what they were doing trying to show off or take off."],"trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around September 10th 2013"],"Country":"Canada","Region":"Ontario","Date Submitted":"11/22/2013 05:42 UTC"}
