It didn t look like an aircraft. It had several lights on it, changing to different colours. As I stared at it wondering what it was I noticed that it was really quiet around me. About two minutes into my observation, the silence was broken by some sort of wierd humming sound, followed by a higher pitched \"loo\" sound. It stayed there for what seemed like an hour, and then left. When I went to tell my wife, she said I had only been out for about four minutes. I m really disturbed by this and I am wondering what exactly this was."],"Latitude":"43.366091","Log Number":"","Country":"Canada","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
