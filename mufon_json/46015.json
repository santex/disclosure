Just appeared in the sky to move quiet slowly, it didn't seem to emit any light on the ground or surrounding area, however wasn't close enough to tell. I am not sure what the item was, if it was a flying machine it had a very good grasp of moving through the air as no machine vibration was showing in the light source, it wasn't a plane as it was way to large with no noise and to slow. As an on looker i couldn't only watch, and to my surprise it was in the paper so others saw the same item."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/12/2005 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Saw a very bright white light, looked like a helicoper search light but this did not flicker at all, was perfect white light like it was not moving","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.406833,+-0.745349(46015)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46015) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"Bracknell","Case Number":"46015","Log Number":"GB-03032013-0016","Longitude":"-0.745349"}
