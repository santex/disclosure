{"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-93.816468","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my bed room and i looked out my window and saw an extremely steady bright light. I live in the country and there are roughly three airports near by, along with the air force. Therefore i have seen many planes and flying aircraft, and this was not a plane. I went outside to get a better look and the light got bigger and bigger and seemed to be really high up in the air and really far away. It then turned and moved west and as it moved further southwest, it got smaller. As it turned I could see almost a red glow come from it, and then red and white lights began flashing. This all happened within roughly five minutes or so."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.94108,+-93.816468(19767)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19767) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Date Submitted":"10/02/2009 12:21 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Missouri","Log Number":"US-10022009-0001","Case Number":"19767","City":"warrensburg/higginsville","Latitude":"38.94108","trends":["there have been no other sightings in warrensburg\\higginsville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19767.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19767.html"],"Summary":"extemely large and bright ball of light","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/30/2009 09:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
