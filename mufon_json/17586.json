Looked up saw object passing over at 30 000+ feet, maybe a lot higher; it appeared the size of a passenger plane at 30 to 40 000 feet. Moving north to south. Moved as a high flying aircraft but had no apparent wings or tail. Left no vapour trail. Watched for over one minute as it passed from zenith to visible horizon behind houses. The object was picking up light from the sun at a low angle and I watched to see if wings would become apparent as the angle of the light changed but they did not. Although the object could have been a plane it appeared unlike all other high flying passenger planes. The main reason I thought it strange was because it left no vapour trail at all."],"Latitude":"51.115416","Object Shape":"Cigar","Case Number":"17586","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-0.192876","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Region":"England","Country":"United Kingdom","Log Number":"GB-06212009-0008","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"06/17/2009 08:00 UTC","City":"Crawley","Date Submitted":"06/17/2009 08:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17586.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17586.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
