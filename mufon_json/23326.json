We were grilling out in the parking lot when we noticed this orange firey ball moving on a path from the NE to the SW. It was silent, but low enough you should have heard some sound. The color seemed to pulsate from bright orange to white orange. The description and photo and video of the Ohio sighting on the same night is exactly as it appeared to us. I asked a group of people next to us what it was, no one could explain. In all about 8 or 9 of us watched it move across the sky under the clouds and disappear to the SW."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown"}
