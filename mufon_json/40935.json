I noticed a very bright flash just north of me, and instinctively followed the flash with my eyes to see the source of something bright enough on a sunny day to get my attention. I began watching a silver orb hover just above the tree line from where I could see, and after watching for around a minute I started to point it out to my husband. As soon as I lifted my finger in that direction, he said he was already watching it, he had seen it flash too. I kept my eyes locked on it, for a few minutes, until it seemingly vanished. I began standing on a table seeing if I could trace where it went, turning up unsuccessful, but then noticed a helicopter flying in from the southwest, toward the direction of where the orb had been."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40935.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40935.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.017002,+-98.480706(40935)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40935) map </A>","Region":"Kansas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/19/2012 08:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.017002","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Reflective orb, followed by helicopter LENEXA KS"}
