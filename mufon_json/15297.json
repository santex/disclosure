knew i had spotted it\\they\\them? it was as if it\\they\\them? were making an effort to remove all question from my mind as to what i had seen or was seeing ?, or to acknowledge our meeting ? for some strange reason this is what i felt. i was as if it\\they\\them? had me \"in the sights\" per say. a strange kind of focus feeling came over me, it was as if the object and myself were on\\in\\at someplace else. it was about half the size of a school bus, and like i said, \"fluid abalone\" in nature. i have no idea how long it was above me, it was as if time stood still. the next thing i remember is everyone around the lake, more than 50 people erupting in a roar\\cheer like you would hear at a football game after a touchdown. i had the feeling that no one around the lake really knew what we had just seen, as if a state of shock overcame everyone, nothing more than a animated \"man did you see that\" and a few people looking at me with a big smile and a very tight hug and a wow ! wow ! wow ! from my wife. i could sense a feeling of peace among the people\\campers around the lake, as if we had all just been given something very special. i would like to add that a taste of some kind lingered in my mouth for a couple of days, as if the fillings in my teeth had been oxidized . i can still imagine\\taste the taste when i talk about the experience. tom"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"02/02/2009 07:15 UTC","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:01:45","Disposition":"Unknown"}
