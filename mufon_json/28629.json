{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","Region":"California","divs":["Sighting Details I was going for a quick drive to the local creamery, heard the sound of (fighter)jets wich only lasted around 40 sec; looked up, no sight of the jets. I was obout to get inside my truck while looking up and thats when I saw them, flying side by side, then 2 drop back forming a triangle, then the lead ufo droped back forming the same triangle but with 2 leading the formation. they seem to be white but were to far up to really be true on the color. 2 out of 3 other witness saw them but after they had spread out (ufo's). I ran to get my camera started recording, jus to my surprise it had no memory card in it. I had to go and the objects stayed there completly still. I was wondering if anyone heard, saw, or read anything that had to with jets been scramble near Stockton, California."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"3 UFO's flying in various formations and separating to a stop.","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-121.28403","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.965562,+-121.28403(28629)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28629) map </A>","City":"Stockton","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"08/04/2011 11:17 UTC","Case Number":"28629","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"37.965562","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Blimp, Sphere","Log Number":"US-08042011-0074","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28629.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28629.html"],"trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Stockton","There were no other sightings in Stockton on or around April 10th 2011"],"Date of the Event":"04/10/2011 12:00 UTC"}
