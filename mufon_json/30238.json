And IS in our government and are in control of our political world. You people need to understand that they are here for and our government has NO idea what the h*** to think about it, other than their hands are tied. My pictures convinced Me. It's all a wait and see game. On March 19th , 2011 ,, the moon was close to earth, the closest it will be in years to come. So,,I decided to take some pictures. UHHH OHHH ,,why are their silver objects around our moon. Also,,, green objects,,blue objects,,I know a star when I see one,, and these are NOT stars in My photos. I Zoomed into the pictures on My computer ,, and I KNOW these are craft of some kind. NOT from here,,,unless We already have this fabulous tech. Which I'm sure We do, thanks to our alien contacts. These photos of the moon I took are a bit blurry ( as far as the moon ) but,,,ooops ,, the crafts and colors come in quite well.
