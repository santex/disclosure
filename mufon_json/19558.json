It caught my attention due to its speed of flight. It was too small for a plane and too fast for a bird. As I looked I could make out no discernible protuberances such as wings or fins - it was simply a small silver ball moving in a very straight line. It eventually disappeared from my line of sight as it flew over neighbouring houses moving roughly South. We have planes flying over head fairly regularly and in the next half an hour I observed two. The first a high flying jet which moved across the sky extremely slowly compared to the object I had seen. The second was a single engine propellor plane which appeared to be flying at a similar height but was noticeably bigger and quite clearly an aircraft."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Portchester","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"GB-09212009-0033","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Shiny, silver round object flew past","Region":"England","Latitude":"50.839988","Object Shape":"Circle","Tags":"City"}
