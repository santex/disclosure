He pointed straight up and there was an object that was hovering. It looked white at first, but then it would dim out and then flash, like it was reflecting the sun (which was setting). We were all just confused and in awe. We went over what it could be, a balloon (no, because it was stationary) a plane (wasn't moving, helicopter (too high). We watched this object for up to 20 minutes before it just disappeared. No one felt anything weird, except I started seeing \"specs\" in my vision, but I chalk it up to looking straight up for almost a half an hour. I don't think it was related more than that."],"Country":"United States","City":"Redding"}
