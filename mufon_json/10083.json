{"Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 8:05 pm I was outside looking at the stars when I saw 2 to 3 red blinking lights. When I looked closer I noticed that there was 8 to 10 red blinking lights in a triangular formation. They appeared to be high and fairly spread apart but kept the triangular formation. There was a single plane flying in the same direction what seemed to be seconds after I lost sight of the red triangle shaped lights."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Approximately 8 to 10 red blinking lights in a triangular formation","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"03/28/2008 08:05 UTC","Case Number":"10083","Log Number":"US-03292008-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.239623,+-118.518358(10083)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10083) map </A>","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10083.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10083.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10083.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"34.239623","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/28/2008 08:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around March 28th 2008"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-118.518358","City":"Los Angeles","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
