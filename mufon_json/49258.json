A few days later when I downloaded the images onto my computer I noticed a dark smudge in 1 frame of my images. The image was made with a Fuji X100 camera which has a fixed lens and is sealed to outside elements which ruled out dust or dirty sensor. I have no idea what it is but appears to be moving at a high rate of speed and appears to be below the clouds."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/23/2013 12:26 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.251516","Object Features":"Unknown"}
