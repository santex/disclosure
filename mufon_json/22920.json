Walked outside my home and looked north to see approximately nine more bright, flickering orange lights moving eastward and apparently ascending at a very fast rate. At first, I thought it may have been a helicopter but it was too fast and the bright orange, flickering light is unlike anything I have ever seen flying in the sky. The lights appeared to ascend at a fast rate and I believe the flickering lights \"went out\" as a result of moving away from me. I have never experienced a 'UFO' before but it's a strange feeling--this was something technologically advanced. Perhaps from Area 51 just north of our city?"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22920.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22920.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"22920","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.118696,+-115.165016(22920)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22920) map </A>","Latitude":"36.118696","Date of the Event":"04/20/2010 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-04212010-0004","Summary":"About Ten Flickering Orange Lights","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Nevada","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around April 20th 2010"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Las Vegas"}
