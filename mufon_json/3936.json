I looked up and dropped my book, wondering if I should call the Local ANG intercept wing or hide under my bed. I didnt really know what to make of this. Above me, outside my window, was a huge, wedge shaped object, with four large, disc-shaped lights on its underside. It flew over the house, east to west direction, stopped in mid air, and began doing a series of aerobatic maneuvers and hovered for a while, then shot off over the horizon. I proceeded to hide under my covers until daybreak, sweating profuseley. The object mereley vanished over the horizon. I was very firghtened, mostly because at the time, I was into the habit of reading abduction horror stories, and had just finished reeading Fire in the Sky."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Latitude":"41.735306"}
