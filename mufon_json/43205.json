{"divs":["Sighting Details While out doing astophotography we observed a slow silent golf-ball sized object, which appeared to be an orange-white triangle of lights (opaque surface) traveling on a E to SE trajectory.

Sighting lasted no more than 1-2 minutes before disappearing."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43205.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43205.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/13/2012 10:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"43205","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"White to Orange shaped triangle hovering and behaving strangely","Log Number":"US-10132012-0005","Latitude":"32.228703","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around October 13th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-110.923409","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.228703,+-110.923409(43205)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43205) map </A>","City":"Tucson","Region":"Arizona","Date Submitted":"10/13/2012 03:27 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
