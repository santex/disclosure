His son said what the hell is that! We looked up in the sky and there was a bright object that was about the size, shape, and traveled the same path of the space station. There was a light or aura that extended from the object in the shape as best described a Nike swoosh that beemed out from the North side of the obect to the front of it. The aura traveled perfectly in sync with the object. There were five of us that saw it. This object never moved rapidly and traveled at the same speed until it disapaited into the eastern sky."],"Latitude":"44.046673","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fountain","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Bright light, J shaped (nike swoosh shape) light beaming from the north side of the obect out and to the east in front of the object","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19206.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19206.html"],"Longitude":"-86.178689","City":"Fountain","Region":"Michigan","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.046673,+-86.178689(19206)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19206) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/09/2009 11:14 UTC","Log Number":"US-09092009-0034","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Case Number":"19206"}
