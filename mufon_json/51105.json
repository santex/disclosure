Same pattern as I reported to mufon case # 51067 Tonight the object hovered for about an hour then started moving west. i'm surprised that nobody else has noticed the bright star-like object in the sky. I first noticed the light sept 23rd 2013 and again on the 24th 25th and im sure ill see it again tomorrow. If you live in the area of Eglinton ave and markham rd look up in the sky tomorrow night around 7:30pm just before dark above the metro grocery store at the corner. Who knows it might be there, it's one thing to see something once but to see it four times on four different days is strange."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"4 night event bright light","Latitude":"43.658156","City":"Toronto","Date Submitted":"09/26/2013 08:36 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ontario","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51105.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51105.html"],"Log Number":"CA-09262013-0015","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON"}
