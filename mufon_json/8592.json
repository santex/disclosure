My son was driving and it was around 9:00pm driving down 169 north. We were talking and then we noticed that there was a object that had bright white lights undernealth with some red lights and a red light on the top and some on the sides. It was a little ways away down the highway. Then it started to decend on our side of the highway and shot straight across the highway stopped - like it was waiting for us to get closer. Then flew over the car. My son rolled down the car window and watched it go over. It stopped and was sitting next to a tower that red lights.

We went further down the road watching in the rear window and it turned the white lights back on a left."],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Weather Factors":"None"}
