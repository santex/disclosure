mommie!, there are monsters in our house!\" my first duty was to try to calm them down. they tried talking over each other, to tell each of their stories. finally, they managed to get the whole thing out. i was so frightened, i was really afraid to go upstairs, and i did not want to leave their sides, since i was the only one wide awake! the next day, my son tried to explain what happened to his father, who kept not believing his son... finally, my son remembered the big noise of the trash cans crunching, when their small extremely well lit ship ran into them, as it hovered, careening down the narrow street with lots of parked cars to avoid. he went outside, down the 45 degree short drive-way, and found the metal cans, which had been taken out to the street level for pick-up, at the bottom of the drive way, and they looked like something had folded them in half, as if there was a knife crease horizontally, in the middle of the two of them. something had to hit them mid-level, and very hard, to make a metal, corrugated can to fold practically in half. i then told him about the strange light pouring into our bedroom as if something without a motor, was hovering over our house-- and how i tried in vain, to wake him up, by shouting and shaking him. my son never slept in his room upstairs, or any bedroom --except mine, until we moved, and until he was fourteen years old, he was suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome, as i was. the fact that one of them slapped my daughter across the face, really made her feel frightened, and violated in a way she cannot deal with, even today. i am not sure if we were abducted, or if they were just in our home, observing us.... i still do not sleep well, and have a stress-related disease. it is almost like i have to stay awake, to guard my home, and myself. i keep big dogs in my room, now, out of fear this may happen again. my son was traumatized for years, afterward. my husband never did wake up that night. our kids were afraid to sleep in their own upstairs rooms, and never felt safe in that house. finally, we moved."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/30/1989 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around November 30th 1989"],"Latitude":"34.132247","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22159.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22159.html"],"Case Number":"22159","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
