While i was doing this, a small object in the sky (star size) caught my attention. I looked at it thinking it was a plane straight away then i noticed that it was moving pretty fast and it was an oval white object. I viewed it for about 10 seconds then ran inside to get my camera, and when i came out it was gone. While i was trying to record the sky incase any more objects came, my camera then died and started going weird. Now my camera doesn't work."],"trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Brisbane","There were no other sightings in Brisbane on or around May 30th 2010"],"Country":"Australia","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-27.469583,+153.027832(23516)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23516) map </A>"}
