I was admiring the cloud and the incredible colors that were around it in the sky.It was stunning1 Just then, about five gold discs appeared from the left of the cloud! They were flying in an almost straight formation passing in front of the cloud! What was more amazing was how the object on the left changed position as they circled around the cloud, almost as if he did not want to enter it as the circled! They were close enough to the cloud, if he had not maneuvered to the right, by dropping below the others then positioning on the right wing,it would have entered the cloud! I told everyone in the house what I saw, they did not know what to make of it. I have never seen a ufo, this was my first!I wish I had a amera!"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3233.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3233.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.959135","Date of the Event":"03/25/1997 08:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.959135,+-75.160399(3233)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3233) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"New Jersey","Log Number":"US-06232005-0001","Date Submitted":"03/25/1997 08:00 UTC","Summary":"At dusk, while looking at the comet that was visible for days,I saw several gold discs flying in formation after a thunderstorm!","Case Number":"3233","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around March 25th 1997"]}
