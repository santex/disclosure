I was facing south with my back against the side of the pool. I was looking at lightening bugs in the backyard and then looked up and noticed a bright egg-shaped light. It was moving rapidly across the sky in a northeastern direction. It was gone in less than a minute. The object did not have any blinking lights and no wings. I was not sure what to make of it. After it was gone, I thought I saw something amazing. My wife and my friends were inside at the time of the event. There were no witnesses to my knowledge. I live near an airport and see aircraft everyday. I have never seen anything like this before. It was pretty spectacular."],"Log Number":"US-06222010-0011","Latitude":"39.312684","Summary":"I saw a bright white egg shaped light moving rapidly across the sky.","Object Shape":"Egg","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-76.465202","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.312684,+-76.465202(23896)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23896) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/19/2010 09:01 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/22/2010 07:34 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Maryland"}
