(these thoughts of logic and determination go through my mind when i see something, is a thought\\deduction process). they were flying low, about the altitude a copter would fly. i continued to watch as the moved closer and then realized they were unknown craft and knew what i was seeing was very likely extra terrestrial or unknown gov't technology. i lean towards the former due to the fact these craft disappear so fast and quietly. they moved slow, would \"dance\" around, getting so close looked like they were almost touching, then one would cavort around the other. had no binocs or camera and the brightness of day made it hard to tell the shape (guessing triangular or saucer, but hard to say). they started to move up over building, at this point i ran down stairs and out but they just vanished. this is the second time in 3 months i have witnessed a ufo. will submit the other later. i am well-versed in science and aware there are many races here and elsewhere. i do not understand the denial at this point."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29474.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29474.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.002903","Summary":"2 objects approached from southwest","Case Number":"29474","Log Number":"US-06102011-0006","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Region":"North Carolina","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"06/09/2011 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-78.892899","trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Durham","There was one other sighting in Durham on or around June 9th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.002903,+-78.892899(29474)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29474) map </A>"}
