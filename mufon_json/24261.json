I was starring off into the sky (eastward) when my wife asked what something was and pointed towards the west. I looked and it was a cross shaped UFO that was glowing red and orange. At first I figured it was a firework. It hovered for 3 or 4 minutes before moving around sporadically. It then faded away towards the west. We also noticed 3 + air planes flying towards where the UFO faded away. The only reason I'm reporting this is because so many other people seem to have seen the same thing. I posted this story on my Facebook account the night it happened."],"Case Number":"24261","Region":"West Virginia","Latitude":"39.281645","Object Shape":"Cross","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Clarksburg","There were no other sightings in Clarksburg on or around July 4th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Wings","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Burning floating cross.","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
