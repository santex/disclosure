{"Date Submitted":"10/25/2013 02:41 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was studying in the terrace of my apartment when I saw this strange object flying through the sky from my left to the right. First I though it was just an airplane because of the green light blinking. I kept looking as was too slow for being a plane when suddenly it changed the direction and started moving to the left. I went into my apartment to take my phone to start recording the scene. When i came back, the UFO was still up in the sky. After few seconds, it started to descend, turning red and then dissapeared from my sight. Never had an experience like this before, it was scary!"],"Case Number":"51823","Region":"Santiago Metropolitan Region","Longitude":"-70.58325","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"-33.413752","Object Features":"None","City":"Santiago","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Santiago","There were no other sightings in Santiago on or around October 25th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Strange object flying from one side to another, up and down and changing colors from red to green","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51823.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51823.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"10/25/2013 02:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-33.413752,+-70.58325(51823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51823) map </A>","Country":"Chile","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Log Number":"CL-10252013-0004"}
