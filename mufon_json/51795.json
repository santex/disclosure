{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile on a drive to St. Johns with a sibling and a close family friend in the car the following took place: It was approximately 2:00 am several years back. We were heading toward st Johns from the northwest travelling Colony Road. Roughly half to three-quarters of a mile from the Krepps Road intersection I observed a football or egg shaped object streak across the sky and out of sight in a matter of seconds. It was a vivid green and appeared to leave a trail behind, more a streak of light behind the object due to it's incredible speed. I abruptly stopped the car and asked my passengers what if they had seen the object. They were looking the opposite direction and had only a sense of a brief greenish light. I was shaken by what I had seen and the fact that they apparently hadn't seen the object (and quite possibly questioned my sanity) or didn't want to or weren't able to comprehend what they had seen. Imagine looking out your driver window, seeing a glowing green football shape appear out of nowhere then streak across the sky and out of sight at an amazing speed. I have had other mysterious sightings but this one stands etched into my memory. I don't know what I saw but know it was not a conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.001143,+-84.559152(51795)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51795) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/24/2013 12:04 UTC","Case Number":"51795","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/01/2001 02:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Egg","Longitude":"-84.559152","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51795.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51795.html"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in St. Johns","There were no other sightings in St. Johns on or around October 1st 2001"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"St. Johns","Log Number":"US-10242013-0013","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Michigan","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.001143","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"High velocity unknown object"}
