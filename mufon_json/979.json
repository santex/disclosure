{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was going outside at 8:15 to let in the dog. I saw 2 moving26 blinking bright lights that resembled fireflies. They changed direction inflight, didnt act like a normal aircraft. I ran inside to get my fiancee so shecould see. We were both in awe - watched for approx 45 min until their coursechanged out of our view. These objects acted like yo-yos! They would comeclose to each other then move apart and change from solid or blinking white tosolid red. They would drop out of sight for a brief time then come straight backup into vision. There was absolutely no sound or visible trail of any kind. The maneuvers were extremely quick and sporadic in direction."],"Summary":"2 sporadic flying objects moving all directions","Case Number":"979","Date of the Event":"12/13/2000 08:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"43.869331","Region":"New Hampshire","Tags":"City","Log Number":"","Date Submitted":"12/13/2000 08:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wentworth","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.869331,+-71.917084(979)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (979) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Wentworth","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/979.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/979.html"],"Longitude":"-71.917084","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
