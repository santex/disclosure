Saw what appeared an ember (yellow,orange -- glowing)in the sky. Thought it was a meteor but it wasn't. Then thought perhaps it was a small plane on fire so we watched. As it came closer it was definitely not a plane --- no noise, plus it hovered over us for about 30 seconds then sped up in a direct Northern path. My other two friends had walked further down the street and talked to a lady walking a dog---she had also seen it."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-81.035949","Latitude":"24.7107","Date of the Event":"02/19/2012 08:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-02202012-0006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35947.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35947.html"]}
