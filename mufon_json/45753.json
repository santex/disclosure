John's side road in Aurora,Ontario Canada. Both my wife and I saw 7 bright golden colouration lights in what appeared to be two front triangular formations with single light at rear. No sound, no noise, no blinking lights. Lights were stationary and appeared to be about 50 feet or so floating above the intersection. At first thought it might be an airplane about to crash, but then realized all lights were bright and not moving. Pulled over to photograph, but just as I got cellphone ready to snap picture, lights in formation suddenly moved suddenly to west of my position, ascended quickly and the vanished. Looked up in sky and saw bright light in sky that appeared to be star but then noticed that there were visible lines to object inside the glowing area. Bluish light in sky then disappeared."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.99733","Region":"Ontario","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"01/26/2013 11:35 UTC","Case Number":"45753","Date Submitted":"02/17/2013 08:51 UTC","Country":"Canada"}
