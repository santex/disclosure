There have been reports in the past 2 months sightings. We saw 3 very bright red lights in a trianlge shape hovering over the Morrstiown area. After a minute or so, the 3 lights formed a single line of lights and began to move slowly north towards the Parsippany area. I looked at the clouds and they we moving south east, so I didn't belive the wind was moving the object since they were moving north. Once over the Parsippany area, they formed a triangle again and hovered. The lower red light moved up to one of the red lights while the other red light stayed in place. Then it moved back down to it's original place, forming a triangle again. The red lights then were in cloud cover and we could no longer see them."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15389.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15389_submitter_file2__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15389_submitter_file3__UFO2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15389.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"02/07/2009 08:10 UTC","Region":"New Jersey","City":"Morristown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.798077","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"3 bright red lights.","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"15389"}
