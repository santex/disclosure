It wasn't just about how bright, but how different the brightness looked. It wasn't like a flare in the sky, it was this weird bright object that was REALLY close. 3) My first thoughts were it was a UFO. Well maybe not a UFO UFO, but an object that didn't make sense. Nothing I've seen before. 4) It just went from N of my house to SW of my house. All 4 to 5 of them went from the same direction to the other end. 6) Lights got dimmer and dimmer and I think it's because it was going farther and farther away from me. I have photos and a 5 min video"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48023.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48023.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
