{"Summary":"Almost like a large elaborate flat rectangular kite or somebody's intricate paisley-designed gate took off flying upright across the sky","Case Number":"17941","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Log Number":"US-07082009-0013","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","divs":["sighting detailson july 4, 2009 at about 4:15 pm what appeared to be a thin sheet of orange-brown or rust colored cloud-like substance somewhat rectangular in its confines of an estimated 5 to 10 feet long by 4 to 10 feet across from perhaps 100 feet away, that did not dissipate, flew across our path, heading southbound in denver, over i-76 at just about the area where the overpass exchange to i-25 is reached when driving eastbound on the freeway. 2 adults and 3 children saw this ufo from inside a car and it seemed to come to within less than 50 feet and head more westbound just after passing us. i am sure it could have been picked up by camera, if there are any in that area, since the swift-moving slice-of-cloud or ghostly image was visible to everyone in the car. my initial thought, as i saw it up ahead of us to the north\\left of us was that this might be a toxic cloud that we have heard about, but never seen. it was lower than the clouds in the sky and was right in front of our vehicle as it passed us, heading south. we all had to really stare at it to understand what was happening and try to identify what it was. (it's just my opinion that it wanted us all to get a good look at it, since it went in front of our vehicle and then around to the side where all of us except the driver could continue to try to figure it out.) the driver of the vehicle is a good family friend in the jewish faith, who tried to reason that the anomaly must have some logical, rational explanation, like a fireworks after-image or a weather balloon. he had to agree, though, that due to the rapid and continuous rate of speed at which it traveled, while retaining the see-through, cloud-like appearance and shape, it did not behave in a manner that fits our understanding pertaining to clouds, smoke, or wind. he stated that it looked somewhat like a narrow, vertical chariot, and that whatever it was that we'd observed, \"it seemed to be on a mission.\" he describes the curling moving smoky or cloud-like areas as paisley, especially on the bottom of it. my son drew his version and had the paisley curling swirls at the bottom area as well. i was the front-seat passenger who, likewise, suspect that there is probably some scientific explanation for what we presently have no knowledge about. what we saw seemed to be solid and yet fluid, as if moving around w\\in the confines. we were able to see the white clouds behind it, through the areas where there were \"holes\" in the object. this did not seem to be of metal or any substance that we know of, as it did not reflect light, similar to how the moon looks at night during an eclipse, is how the object seemed to just be there in the air, but flying, and as it passed us, the shape had changed yet stayed within the space. so while it was coming into our line of vision and while it was in front of us, and as it passed us, and after it was traveling southwest of us, the shape it took within it's rectangular confines was similar to seeing moving ultrasound image of a moving creature, except seeming to have no 3-dimensional depth to it. the shapes that we observed did seem somewhat as angels are depicted, having what appear to be wings, and although it was strange to see such a thing travel around us, we were really not frightened by it, just amazed. like my daughter said, it could have been either an angel or a demon. we are still working on making artistic representations of this thing, which is how we determined that it had actually changed shape yet stayed w\\in a certain confined area, being fluid like smoke or cloud in movement, and yet not dissipating as it traveled upright and then as we entered the i-25 freeway, we could no longer see it behind us as it was no longer in our view."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17941.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17941.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.812424,+-105.082854(17941)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17941) map </A>","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Arvada","There were no other sightings in Arvada on or around July 4th 2009"],"City":"Arvada","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 04:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-105.082854","Latitude":"39.812424","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 04:15 UTC","Region":"Colorado"}
