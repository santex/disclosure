We were one block away from our house [in suburb about one mile east of Hwy 37 to Indianapolis] when I saw a big light in the northern sky that appeared to be fairly close to the ground. I was just getting ready to say, \"That looks like a UFO\" when my husband said almost the same thing. We watched the light for a few seconds before a self-luminous \"beam\" came on surrounding the upper half of the ovalish light, the beam was in the shape of an old-fashioned nurse's cap, then, it just disappeared, not sure if it just turned its lights out and we couldn't see it due to gray cloud bank, or if it actually disappeared or went into the clouds. It was about 6:38pm when this occurred."],"Summary":"large amber oval light in northern sky, secondary lights appeared behind it before it disappeared","Region":"Indiana","Date of the Event":"10/25/2005 06:38 UTC","Case Number":"4035","Latitude":"39.435465"}
