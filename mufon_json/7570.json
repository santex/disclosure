(it wasn't a large building; perhaps 3,000 square feet for what could be seen). the installation has since been closed. i was sitting on a bench, awaiting a bus to take me to kenitra for liberty. i was talking to a moroccan friend of mine in french. i saw a star-like object rise in the sky in front of us and i told my friend that it was our new, telecommunications satellite, telstar. then, telstar stopped dead. then it made a series of maneuvers including impossible, sharp-angled turns before it came to a stop and it's movements were slow and aimless. then, the object shot to the horizon within perhaps a 1\\4 of a second. my friend looked at me and said: \"soucoupe volante!\" which is french for \"flying saucer.\" i had not been drinking. i've never been a big drinker. the sky was clear and vision was as clear as you'd expect of a desert environment. i spoke of the experience in the squadbay and the company commander, a mustanger, summoned me to his office. he asked if i wanted to report a ufo. i told him i didn't particularly want to. he responded that i was, then, not to speak about it in the squadbay. i agreed. i don't recall any missing time. i never had any other strange experiences as far as i know. i do dream about flying saucers from time-to-time. i also have dreams of flying without benefit of any kind of artifact. i don't know that there's anything more to it than that."],"Region":"Gharb-Chrarda-Beni Hssen"}
