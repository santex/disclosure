It was late evening. My girlfriend called to me to come outside and look up at three object flying erratically above the mountain ridge about one-half mile away.It was a very clear night and we could see the objects moving in what seemed to be erratic movements that was between a standstill to quick back and forth motions all at the same time without colliding with each other.At times it looked as if the were playing with one another or practicing maneuvers.But it went on for a long time, so long we eat he'd then returned back inside. Went back out moments later to witness the same actions. This happened a long time back but I still remember the aware experienced, experienced the feeling of witnessing something truly spectacular and a event that I would never be able to explain or forget. They eventually left our sight one at a time and never returned."],"Date Submitted":"04/23/2013 03:19 UTC","Log Number":"US-04232013-0006","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-79.01702","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.765553,+-79.01702(46927)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46927) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/06/1984 12:00 UTC","trends":[]}
