I only noticed on 3 of the photos I took of the full moon tonight that there was a strange red object on them, on two of which there is also a white light. When zooming in, it does not look like a plane (this route is also where the planes come down to land at the nearby airport - Arrecife). I wonder if anyone can tell me what the h*ll that is??? I am attaching the high res original pictures, sorry about the size!"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lanzarote, Canary Islands","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.046854,+-13.589973(11217)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11217) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11217.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11217_submitter_file1__P1070614.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11217_submitter_file2__P1070615.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11217_submitter_file3__P1070616.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11217.html"]}
