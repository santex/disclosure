I took a picture of it on my digital camera and down loaded on to my computer. It was very interesting. However it was not until a year later that on closer inspection I notice a strange object in the picture. This is the second sighting I have witnessed by my home. I have alredy once been interviewed by a mufon agent once before. It was nice to be able to speak with someone who understands. I am sending a copy of the picture.
