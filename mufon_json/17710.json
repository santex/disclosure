I was looking at the planes taking off from O'hare International Airport. As I watched the airplanes taking off I notices two bright spheres of light, zipping in and around the path of the planes. They seemed to be dancing with one another, No other way I could put it. They were circling around each other and zipping back and forth. The planes did not seem to be bothered or did they divert from their paths due to the objects. This went on for about 45 seconds to roughly 1 minute, before the objects sped out of site. This is not the first time I have witnessed strange objects in and around O'Hare. I usually carry around my backpack and in it, is my trusty camera. But today of all days I decided to leave it at home and travel light."],"Date of the Event":"06/26/2009 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"06/26/2009 12:00 UTC","Region":"Illinois","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17710.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17710.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere"}
