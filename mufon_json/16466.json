I positively can say that I did not see that object when I was taking the picture. I was taking various shots of the scenery that day. The Lajas Aerostat can be seen to the left of the picture higher up. Again, I am absolutely certain that I did not see or hear anything flying around the area when I took this picture. I have a few other shots of the same area which do not show anything unusual. This is looking East walking down from the Lighthouse. Just this one. What is even more interesting is that later that night I saw an object in the sky that I reported on this site before I noticed this image. This was taken with a Sony 7 MP digital camera. I would love to know what this object was! I know it was not a jet, airplane or helicopter as i would have seen and heard it!"],"Date of the Event":"04/04/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16466.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16466_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16466.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"See my comments and picture.","City":"Combate","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Combate","There was one other sighting in Combate on or around April 4th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
