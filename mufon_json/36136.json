It came into Dublin from the southeast and continued traveling to the northwest. It looked like one fireball at first and then it would look like 2 fireballs side by side. They looked like they were spiining around each other or vibrating. It also appeared to have a fluttering movement to it. It was moving very fast. There was also a strong static feeling in the air. The flight path was straight but it was not smooth at all. It appeared to have blurry edges like it was vibrating. It made no sound. There is a mufon report from south Texas that same night at 8:30 pm. That one was moving north. We saw this object in north central Texas at 8:52 pm. They very well could be the same object as there was alot of similarities. We watched it for about 30 seconds and then it just disappeared."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Oval, Sphere","Date Submitted":"02/27/2012 08:03 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","City":"Dublin","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-02272012-0018"}
