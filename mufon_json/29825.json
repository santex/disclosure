{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsthere were four of us looking out over our yard and into the grass field that lay beyond our yard. the total distance of our yard and the field was about 200 meters , and the width being about 75 meters. i noticed a bright light that appeared to be about 50 meters up in the air and about 100 meters from our position. i asked the other four if they saw the light and we all stared at it for a good 15- 20 seconds. it looked alot like a car headlight only maybe a little larger. as we watched it , suddenly it traveled horizontally 50 meters to the right, then about 60 meters to the upper left and then vansihed. this movement all occured in about 250 ms or about 1\\4 of a second. i do not recall if the light left a traceable line that indicated it proceeded upward or not. i do recall however, that the light was undoubtedly pointed in our direction and was unlike anything i have ever seen. i do not believe the object had any personel on board, but perhaps it could have been an apparatus of which to observe from a larger craft. though this was years ago and i was pretty young mayb e 12 or 13, we all remember this occurance vividly."],"Date of the Event":"06/30/1997 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-93.390291","trends":["There have been no other sightings in McCallsburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.165499,+-93.390291(29825)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29825) map </A>","Case Number":"29825","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/01/2011 12:06 UTC","Region":"Iowa","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.165499","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07012011-0006","City":"McCallsburg","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29825.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29825.html"],"Summary":"small bright light hovered, then retreated in an instant"}
