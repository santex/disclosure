I even pulled over to take a look. The object looked like it was still like a tower not moving, but I really did not look at it very hard until I noticed it was just gone. I have been by there several times since, both daytime and night, no tower in that area ? I also read where a person seen the same thing in McCullogh couty as well. I would have not posted this but I have been seeing the UFO sightings in Stephenville and wondered if this was the same thing."],"Log Number":"US-01202008-0008","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9074","Weather Factors":"Fog","Latitude":"31.703766","Longitude":"-98.123923","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Seen what looked like a tower at first near Hamilton","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Hamilton","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Hamilton","There were no other sightings in Hamilton on or around December 10th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9074.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9074.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/10/2007 10:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
