As she parked the car she noticed three large white lights (size of baseballs from her distance) descending slowly from the sky. She watched them as they descended out of view behind Renders. She took a picture of the last white light she saw before she lost view it. She said she knows what airplane streaks look like and this wasnt it. They were moving together very slowly downwards towards the ground. She took a picture because the lights acted so strange & out of place. She couldnt wait to tell me about it and show me the picture!"],"Log Number":"US-11132012-0010","Date of the Event":"11/09/2012 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.132726","Object Flight Path":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43893.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43893_submitter_file1__redners.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43893.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.132726,+-75.536394(43893)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43893) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"43893","Summary":"(GS) Three white lights slowly descending behind building","Longitude":"-75.536394","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/13/2012 05:29 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Phoenixville"}
