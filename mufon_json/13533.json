{"Latitude":"39.168805","Tags":"City","City":"Bloomington","divs":["sighting detailswas driving home from work yesterday 11\\3\\08. it was 6:12 pm when i sighted \"object\". to the south i saw the moon and whatever planet or star that is currently very close to it. i turned north (away from the moon) onto hwy 37. there was nothing visible in the sky to the north because of total cloud coverage. after about 2 minutes of driving, i saw a starlike object suddenly appear below the cloud line. it descended almost straight down, very rapidly and vanished. (it may have been already descending from above the cloudline, invisible to me) it was a round, bright whitish blue light (looking very much like a star except slightly brighter). it appeared about a mile to the north of my vehicle, slightly to the west of hwy 37 approx 6 overall miles north of bloomington, in. the object descended very rapidly almost straight down. its trajectory leaned to the west slightly, by only 5 degrees. the object held its round shape perfectly. there was no streaking or trail behind it. the light remained very consistent and no flashing. after 2-3 seconds it vanished. it was probably a few hundred feet above the tree lines when it just disappeared. it just disappeared, no noise and no flash. i noticed the object because the sky was darkening and the clouds were low with a dark blue back drop. i was driving looking ahead at the road and the light caught my eye. i thought at first it was a star. as i kept driving i wondered how a star could basically just drop straight down out of the sky, below the clouds and hold its shape perfectly and quietly disappear above the trees."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Indiana","Case Number":"13533","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-11042008-0017","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.168805,+-86.523876(13533)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13533) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-86.523876","Date of the Event":"11/03/2008 06:12 UTC","Summary":"saw starlike object appear below cloudline and descend rapidly and vanish","Date Submitted":"11/03/2008 06:12 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Bloomington","There was one other sighting in Bloomington on or around November 3rd 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13533.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13533.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
