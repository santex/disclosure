( i have added pics of the children's drawings) i did not since i really didn't see anything but maybe a flash of orange light. it wasn't very bright, but enough you would notice. the roof of the van blocked my sight. my parents were not very impressed, but somewhat supportive of at least the children's account of what was seen. on the drive home from my folk's, i advised the children to keep quiet about the sighting to friends at school. i also tried to calm my son down since he seemed to be having a hard time getting over being scared. of course, all of us had our eyes glued to the sky all the way home. my husband was already asleep when we got home so we had to wait until the next day to get his opinion and input about the incident. my husband ought to have \"skeptic\" as his middle name, and was kinda dismissive until i remembered the drawings. he didn't know what to say after that. i watched the papers and local news for weeks very closely for any mention of \"lights in the sky\". i wanted to call and ask if any police officers at the roadblock saw anything, but my father is a retired oxford police officer of 20+ years and i don't need that kind of grief. i wrote to a couple of \"paranormal\\ufo investigation groups, but did not get any answer. i came upon this site and now maybe, i can get some answers."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Saturn-like","City":"Oxford","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23179.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23179_submitter_file1__random086.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23179_submitter_file2__random088.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23179_submitter_file3__random093.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23179.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.375825,+-89.512788(23179)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23179) map </A>","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other, Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/07/2010 11:10 UTC","Latitude":"34.375825","Log Number":"US-05072010-0007","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
