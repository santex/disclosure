We have a large picture window which looks out over all of Goodlettsville. At approximately 6:50 I looked out the window as I was watching t.v. and saw four bright white lights in the northwest sky. The sky was clear and their was no moon. I saw four bright white lights just above the trees on a far hillside. The lights were bright white, then they changed to a bright red, then they changed back to a bright white. They all changed color at the same time. They were moving slowing as the colors changed back and forth from white to red. Then they looked as if they were turning and they were gone. The longer I thought about what I had seen the more I realized something was not right about what I had just seen so I decided I needed to repost it."],"Latitude":"36.323107","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Goodlettsville","There were no other sightings in Goodlettsville on or around March 8th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22226.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22226.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.323107,+-86.71333(22226)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22226) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.71333","Country":"United States","Case Number":"22226","Disposition":"Unknown"}
