When I looked up I clearly saw a pulse jet with \"a string of pearl like\" white contrail. I am an amateur astronomer and I know how to identify objects. I have never seen anything like it before. I was kicking myself because I had no camera. There was also a commercial airliner near by and its contrail was normal, so I know it wasn't from upper winds."],"Date Submitted":"08/20/2009 05:05 UTC","Log Number":"US-08212009-0010","City":"Detroit","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 56 other sightings in Detroit","There were no other sightings in Detroit on or around August 20th 2009"],"Longitude":"-83.043424","Case Number":"18789","Date of the Event":"08/20/2009 05:05 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18789.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18789.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"Aurora pulse jet seen.","Country":"United States"}
