{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile traveling east on 422 toward robesonia, I spotted a bright light in the northern part of the sky. At first it looked like how venus looks at night shining very brightly. The sky was very blue and no clouds were present in its area of sight. Next the object started to \"uncloak\" its self, it appeared to be in the shape of a cylinder that was a shiney and metalic in its form. I tried to keep my eyes on the road and on the object, but just as it appeared it vanished clear out of sight. I could not gage its size or how high up it was in the sky."],"Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-06212007-0009","Case Number":"7289","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.351759,+-76.134389(7289)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7289) map </A>","Latitude":"40.351759","Summary":"Flying object spotted in eastern PA","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Robesonia","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/21/2007 11:25 UTC","Longitude":"-76.134389","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7289.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7289.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/21/2007 11:25 UTC","City":"Robesonia"}
