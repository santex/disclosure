It was about 7:30 p.m. I was on hwy 376 heading to Statenville when this HUGE ufo was coming out of the sky as if it was gonna land on the Road. So the lady in front of and her son pulled over just as I did, and we got out of the car and went to run up the ditch and about that time it got tree top level and vanished in thin air. It was not dark yet and between each light that as REAlly Bright you could see the sky. When it left we watch stuff falling on the ground it looked metalic like and I had a pair of latex gloves in my truck so I went over and picked some of this stuff up and put it inside a zaxbys bag that I had from lunch in my truck. I just kept it. I stll have it."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in statenville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02222012-0014","Summary":"it was coming down like it was gonna land on hwy. 376 and disappeared","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"30.70343","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.70343,+-83.028061(35997)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35997) map </A>","Case Number":"35997","Country":"United States","City":"statenville","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35997.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35997.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
