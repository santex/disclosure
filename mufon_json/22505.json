We stopped and she was talking to another friend of ours that was up on a balcony. I was looking up at the moon and stars, it was a very clear night. I saw the object and thought, what is that? At first I thought could it be a bird but within a second I knew it was not a bird because of it's perfect triangle shape and there was no flapping of wings. Also it flew in a strait line, and very smoothy. Then I thought, is it some kind of crazy looking plane?, but I noted that there were no lights on it, and again that triangle shape was not like a plane. Then I thought oh my gosh I'm actually seeing a ufo. I then pointed and said to my friend \"do you see that?\" But I knew it was about to be out of sight, and it was, that was when I noticed how fast it was moving because a plane would not be out of sight so fast, and because there was no sound for me of my friends to hear. I told them what I saw. And that's it."]}
