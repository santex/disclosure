{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/06/2012 10:59 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt around the same time every evening for the last three days and on previous occasions the same glowing sphere makes a slow descent to horizon and when it gets close to the horizon a second glowing sphere pops up usually to the right of the object with the same pulsation glow of pinkish-red. Because of its higher intensity in color and brightness in comparisson to any other objects in the sky, I immediately was locked onto this object until it faded below the horizon and would periodically resurface until finally it did not do so again. I had a clear view of it for the entire duration of its flight. I would welcome any field investigators to join us in wittnessing this event. My digital camera would not show the target in the viewer, so unfortunately I dont have any images or footage. I am sure that it will appear again tomorrow and maybe again the next evening."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New Mexico","Object Shape":"Egg, Fireball, Oval, Sphere, Teardrop","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.208826,+-107.836815(34679)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34679) map </A>","Longitude":"-107.836815","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34679.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34679.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/06/2012 07:15 UTC","Summary":"Third night of sighting.
