Went out this night to watch metor shower, saw two.... Then something caught my eye, cigar shaped object very high, first I thought it was a search light shinning on some lower thin clouds but realized the object was above the clouds. Outline of object against the stars caused a dark cigar shape moving fast from South to North in a straight line. I took my eyes off the object to turn around and quickley found it again. I kept looking at the object, no lights, no sound, just a cigar shape, no wings, nothing else to identify... Viewed it for about 6 seconds and lost it from the glare of the city lights. Based on comparison, of stars, space station, metors, planes, etc the object has to be huge. Object did not change size, speed or direction. I have seen strange objects but was able to determine and explain... Not this one!!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18846.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18846.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/12/2009 10:16 UTC"}
