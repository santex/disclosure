Jan. 24 2009 When we noticed a bright light in the sky to the left of us. We thought it might be a helicopter. It took us half hour to get home and it was moving in front of us to our left. When we got home we noticed the light stopped over Canandaigua Lake. We went out on our deck and watched it for one and a half hours. While watching it we noticed it was glowing like a cystal ball while rotationing and changing shapes.We have seen this several nights. It seems to appear around 7p.m. Sometimes it goes quickly and other times it seems to stay longer. Tonight Mar.13 2009 we saw it for one half hour. This time my husband noticed a smaller beam of light flew from the round object."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.16773,+-77.606452(16004)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16004) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"43.16773","Longitude":"-77.606452","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like, Other","Summary":"Round object crystal ball shaped changing shapes like a jelly fish.","Log Number":"US-03142009-0001","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"16004","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/24/2009 08:30 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 53 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around January 24th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Rochester","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16004.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16004.html"]}
