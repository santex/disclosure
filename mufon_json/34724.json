{"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"34724","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy boyfriend and I saw the object in the evening sky at about 6 pm. We first saw it near the constellation orion, but as the night went on, orion mved and the object did not. The ufo stayed in the same spot until midnight when we went to bed. We do not know how long it stayed there, but it was gone the next night. We searhed the whole sky and could not find it. The ufo was a circular shape that had some type of waves coming off each side. The ufo was flashing lights continuously the entire time we saw it. It flashed orange, red, blue, green, white, and yellow. There was no order to the flashing of the colors or the timing of the flashes. However, the lights did get brighter and dimmer randomly. At one point, a plane or helicopter flew across the sky. In comparison the ufo was much larger, brighter, and definitely stationary."],"Summary":"Several of us saw the bright object in the sky. thought it was plane or star, but did not move and flashed too many colors to be a star.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Oklahoma","Log Number":"US-01082012-0024","Latitude":"35.755415","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-95.353164","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.755415,+-95.353164(34724)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34724) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Muskogee","Date of the Event":"01/05/2012 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34724.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34724.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/08/2012 08:31 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Muskogee","There were no other sightings in Muskogee on or around January 5th 2012"],"Country":"United States"}
