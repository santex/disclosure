In the night sky it looks like a star with wings that changes colors.But last night we took digital pictures and we were blown away. It looks like a galactic EBANI, changing colors and shapes and ejecting objects. It was facing true east. Then we noticed a second object almost exactly like the first one in the direction northeast. They both pulsated different colors to the naked eye, and took on whole new shapes and colors when we took pictures of them. we also caught some shots of other objects we couldn't see with our eyes at all. They showed up in the photos after the fact. The objects were still in the sky when we went back in. We felt we had documented them as best we could."]}
