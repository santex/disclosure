My sister-in-law and myself watched them disappear and then three more appeared. the pattern appeared to be vertical movement and then disappear two or three at a time. I attempted to take photos but was unable to catch them on most of the photos. Some photos have small teardrop light - this is not what it looked like in person. When we started to discuss our first thought was ufo because there have been numerous sightings in the Peterborough area and rumours of such lights in sky. My feeling at the time was that they appeared beautiful and calming in a way almost alive. they did not look like lights from aircraft or anything else i have ever seen. There was absolutley no sound at all from these objects and after perhaps 12 -15 of them passed in sky we did not witness any more"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41256.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41256.html"],"Latitude":"44.540457","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ontario","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.540457,+-78.546369(41256)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41256) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-78.546369","City":"Kawartha Lakes","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Several orange glowing lights appeared in the sky two or three at a time.
