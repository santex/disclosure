As we exited we were facing roughly due east or slightly east-southeast looking upward about 60 degrees above the horizon. Above us, over the building across the street from the theater we saw an object on our right at about 2 o���clock passing on a north to south trajectory. A dim dark outline of the object was visible. The shape was disk-like. The object disappeared behind the building at about 10 o���clock. We could distinctly see crisp outlines of rectangular windows which were brightly lit. These rectangular shapes were passing left to right, ie., in a direction opposite the object���s trajectory, with each rectangle disappearing on the right as it rotated around and a new one appearing on the left. The object���s horizontal span to the eye was perhaps 10 to 20 degrees. It was clear that the object was very close. It appeared to be within a distance of 200 feet at most. There were about 15 to 30 people ahead of us who had just exited, too. Most of them began running toward the left across the street, to follow the object, which was moving beyond the building located across the street. The object appeared to be headed in a southerly direction. We all ran, because we knew it was heading toward an enormous field, the old, original airfield on Governors Island, where the Wright Brothers first demonstrated their prototype plane to the United States Army. At the time this field was no longer in use except perhaps for an occasional helicopter. My friend and I had just seen a performance of the movie, \"The Ugly American\" with Marlon Brando. The movie had started very late in the afternoon and ended in the early evening. As we exited it had just turned dark. The sky was fairly clear with a few low clouds that evening. Visibility was good. The time was perhaps about 8 PM, possibly 7 PM. My friend and I left by the theater's front door. Immediately, as we exited the theater we looked directly up and overhead. Others exiting just before us had seen the object, too. What made us first notice the object was the excited reports of those who had just exited before us. Altogether about 20 people ran from the theater out to the air field. The object appeared to be moving at a steady speed. I would guess it was going only about 20 to 30 MPH, based on my sense of its altitude and distance. We saw it continue on in a southerly direction at a low altitude, until it disappeared from view somewhere over Staten Island. Total elapsed time until the object became too indistinct was about 2 to 3 minutes. When we first saw it we did not have any idea what it was. We were very attuned to the sky. We commuted through the harbor by ferry every day to go to school on Staten Island. Since Governors Island is right in the middle of New York Harbor, aircraft pass overhead all the time. Thus people residing there, such as those who were exiting the theater that evening, are naturally accustomed to seeing aircraft frequently overhead. However, this was not any ordinary aircraft. The object was clearly not a plane for it was moving much slower than a plane would. Nor was it a helicopter. There was no sound, no noise at all. Governors Island is exceptionally quiet. You could tell when aircraft were flying low over the island. Low altitude passovers were infrequent. This object flew much lower than any I had ever seen in the two years I had lived on the island. We didn���t believe any balloon could produce such a convincing appearance of rotation, because it was simply too close for us to be unable detect whether it was a balloon. Also it was moving much faster than we thought any balloon could go. We had seen a number of dirigibles but did not know of any that had rotating lights. None of the flashy well-lit ones that are common today were common in New York Harbor then. The unfamiliar qualities of this object led some 25 people to run out of the theater toward it. We were so sure that this was a valid UFO sighting that we expected there to be some mention of it in the next day or two in the newspaper. We saw no news reports."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8160.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8160.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Clear visual on Governors Island, NY, of rotating object passing overhead north to south","Log Number":"US-10172007-0003","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"New York","Longitude":"-74.004833","Case Number":"8160","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/31/1964 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Window(s)","Latitude":"40.721093","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around March 31st 1964"]}
