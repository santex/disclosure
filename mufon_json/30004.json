We left Sapulpa on Route 66 heading west. We came to an intersection for Highway 33 in between Sapulpa and Kellyville. Right before we made the turn my wife noticed an orange orb with a red haze ring around it. The object was to the south. We turned onto highway 33 and pulled over to the side of the road to observe the object. The orb was coming from the Kellyville direction and passed over highway 33 heading north. Before it crossed the highway it decended a few feet and continued it's path north. When we first seen the object we thought it was a firework of some sort, but the object stayed in the air. The object continued north until it was out of sight. The object was in between a golf ball and tennis ball in size."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30004.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30004.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Orange orb flys over highway on 4th of July.","Latitude":"36.005541","Longitude":"-96.111686","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"07/04/2011 10:45 UTC","Region":"Oklahoma","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Other","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sapulpa","There were no other sightings in Sapulpa on or around July 4th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2011 11:43 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Sapulpa"}
