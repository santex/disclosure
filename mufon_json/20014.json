We were in a backyard, near University & Dry Creek in Centennial, watching over a puppy we were dog-sitting for the night when I noticed a strange, unlit object moving East to West across the sky. The object appeared to be black or dark-gray in color, and I first noticed it because it blocked out stars while it passed overhead. The object's ���wings��� appeared to have a series of circular, light gray dome shaped appendages on the bottom surface, which again were unlit. There were not any clouds in the sky, so it was hard to estimate distance and size, but at best guess I���d say the object was roughly 150 feet across at a distance of 1,000-2,000 feet above the ground. We watched the object pass overhead for 5-10 seconds until some trees blocked our view."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Other, Unknown"}
