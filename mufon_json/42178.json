The reporter seemed upset by this to the point that they got into a car to see where they came from. I've got info to maybe help them understand what they saw. I've lived in LV for 35 years now and this goes on a lot when clouds are present. There are huge spot lights stationed around town, 1 toward the south and 1 towards the NE anyways there are four of them and when the clouds are low enough these lights run certain patterns across the sky, it can be alarming to someone who's never seen them before cause the source is hard to find but not impossible. They come together then blow apart the back together and complete circles it's crazy. I've never really understood why or who does this but I have found 2 of them in the past. Hope it helps the person that reported them."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Nevada","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-115.233548","Summary":"To the person who reported lights in LAS VEGAS sky when it was cloudy.","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.263673,+-115.233548(42178)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42178) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08312012-0017","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/31/2012 03:14 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"N/A"}
