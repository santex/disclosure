And how about WWT that is a much better combination of several telescopes. A big fault if it is just a technical error! And even bigger, if it is something real behind! Search in WWT on both sides of the ecliptic, where the Sun is expected to go or has recently been (now is in Pisces). Venus is relatively nearby. I think if something real is on orbit, it would be on sun-synchronous orbit similar to how SOHO moves around the Sun in step with the Earth. I do not exclude the possibility all that to be just a technical bug, because there are large lines on other parts of the sky - across whole quadrants. See the north polar area on WWT. I guess someone wanted to show us that is exactly a technical error, by making these artificial large lines across the photos of the polar region! Thus we will assume the real lines as errors too!"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15998.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15998.html"],"Latitude":"63.597703","City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-154.485752","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03132009-0008","trends":[],"Summary":"Objects (cigar-shaped lines) found on WWT, and found as cut places on Google Earth.","Region":"Alaska","Date Submitted":"03/13/2009 12:00 UTC"}
