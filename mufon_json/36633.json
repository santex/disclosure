I looked up and saw a red orb with a bright blue aura or \"glow\" around it. It flew in a very odd pattern, with no real direction. Sometimes it'd go right, then left, then lower, then higher, sometimes it'd just stop. After a while two helicopters flew towards it and it appeared to fly low and drop out of view behind South Mountain. The whole event lasted about 7 minutes for me, but I have no clue how long the other people on the corner witnessed it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"03/21/2012 01:05 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"03/19/2012 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.456097,+-112.066377(36633)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36633) map </A>","City":"Phoenix","Country":"United States","Summary":"A dark red orb with a blue aura.
