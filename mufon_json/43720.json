In backyard letting my dogs go to the bathroom. 2. Something kept telling me to watch the sky and I noticed movement 3. Thought it was an airplane at first. 4. Elongated and white with no descriptive markings that I could see. There was a dark spot in the middle that I first assumed were the wings of an airplane. It was flying flying north to south and at some point the part that I thought were wings reflected sunlight. It was flying straight and parallel to the ground. 5. My thoughts were,\"Again? This is the third sighting I've had in a month after years of seeing nothing! Is something about to happen!? Just about every two weeks I've had a sighting?\" 6. Flew out of my line of sight."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.308713,+-77.847772(43720)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43720) map </A>","City":"Ranson","Longitude":"-77.847772","Source":"MUFON"}
