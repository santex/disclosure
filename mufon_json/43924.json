{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving my car in direction Banja Luka, coming back from visiting a friend in a city called Prnjavor, somewhere on half way, my boyfriend an me saw a red sphere in front of us (hard to tell the distance, it was night, hard to orientate, more then one mile maybe. or less) but going strait up with incredible speed, 90 degrees to earth, size was (to our eyes) something about size of a melone. It last just couple of seconds, maybe just 2, hard to tell, beacuse this thing was so fast. It started in a hight of trees and going up until we didnt saw it anymore. I tought to my self, whats happening and in that moment my boyfriend told: Oh my god what is this? I asked: you saw it too? \"Yes.\" You really also saw it, that red light?? \"Yes, red sphere, it was in the shape of sphere!\" We didnt said nothing after that. What to tell... I wasnt so surprised, just excited to be whitness of something like that."],"Case Number":"43924","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.766667,+17.183333(43924)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43924) map </A>","City":"Banja Luka","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.766667","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Banja Luka","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Longitude":"17.183333","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43924.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43924.html"],"Summary":"while driving car with my boyfriend, we saw a red sphere in front of us, going up, strait, with incredible speed.","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Region":"Republika Srpska","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"11/03/2012 09:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"BA-11152012-0009","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"11/15/2012 05:19 UTC"}
