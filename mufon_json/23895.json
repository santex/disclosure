As it got closer, I just saw that it was very bright and it was egg shaped. It was definitely a solid object and pretty high up in the sky. The object was gone in less than a minute. I was calm throughout the event. However, when the event was over, I felt like I saw something amazing. I live near an airport and I see conventional craft everyday. This was different and I have never seen anything like this. My friends and wife were inside during this event. There were no other witnesses that I am aware of."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Maryland","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06222010-0010","Case Number":"23895","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Essex","There was one other sighting in Essex on or around June 19th 2010"],"City":"Essex","Date Submitted":"06/22/2010 07:11 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/19/2010 09:00 UTC"}
