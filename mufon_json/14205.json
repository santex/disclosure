Number":"GB-12032008-0009","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","divs":["sighting detailsin august of 2003 my 2 brothers and me had to look after my uncles house while they were away on holiday for a week. they live in a small village called culverthorpe a few miles outside of sleaford. after a few days of looking after the house, one evening we were outside and the sky was perfectly clear and the sun had just gone down when we noticed 2 white objects over the fields coming towards us. we didn't know what the objects were. one object was big and round while the other was smaller and almost completely round but seemed to have a sharp edge to it and this object was moving faster than the bigger one but they both were moving in the same direction over the fields in front of us. the objects didn't make any sound and moved too fast to be balloons and they basically moved across the sky until we couldn't see them anymore. we were really excited from seeing these objects, and because we still had a day left looking after my uncles house we decided to borrow my dads digital camera just incase we saw anything else. on the last night we were outside in the garden smoking, the stars were out and it was nice and clear. my brothers were taking pictures with the camera and getting orbs which just seemed to turn up in the pictures, we couldn't see them and my view about these orbs is that most of them are just dust\\moisture. when my brothers were taking pictures they were using the flash on the camera. after a while of being outside we noticed something flashing, coming towards us, moving parrellel\\horizontal to the ground, over the trees at the bottom of my uncles paddock which is at the bottom of his garden. as the object came closer we could see that it would flash a white light which covered the entire object, then the light on it would decrease until it would go out, then it would increase in brightness and then flash and continue increasing, flashing, decreasing in brightness and the light going out. this object wasn't making any sound and my brother billy who had the camera took a picture of it. about the same time he took the picture we noticed another identical object coming from the same direction. as this second object was nearly above us we could see there was a smaller object, not perfectly round, which was travelling along with it. this smaller object wasn't flashing, it remained at the same brightness. billy took more pictures of these 2 objects together but because the objects were moving so slowly billy was actually taking pictures and checking how the pictures were turning out and seeing that they were blurry he was deleting any blurry ones and would try and get better pictures. after he got a clear picture, which is when the 2 objects were right above us, we watched them travel over the house and out of sight. later on that night we went back outside after we had gone inside for a while and there was an intense fog and we couldn't see the stars anymore. i think because of the moisture in the air my brothers were getting the orb pictures. attached to this e-mail are the pictures of the objects we saw. number 63 is the first object we saw and was taken just as the light on the object had gone out but you can just about see the object in the top centre of the picture. picture 64 was taken as the second object we saw was overhead and had flashed, you can see the white light around the object. near the lower left of the picture is the smaller white object. because of the settings on the digital camera at the time we saw the objects, the pictures appear quite dark so its best to use autobalance when looking at them, i also brighten them up a bit as well to see the objects better. these objects aren't orbs which you don't see and appear in photos, we saw the flashing objects which are in the pictures. at the time of the sighting i didn't know what the objects were so i felt curious more than anything and basically stood there while they came over us. after the sighting and the more i think about it i have no idea what the objects are we saw so more than anything i would just like to know if there is a simple explanation for the objects. i don't want to get too excited over something that could be really normal but we have no idea what the objects we saw could be. please could you e-mail me and tell me if you have ever seen pictures of similar objects before or have you any idea what these objects could be?"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Flash,
