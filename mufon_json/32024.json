The night was so clear, I stepped out of my car to enjoy the lack of urban sky glow. I am an amateur astronomer, and a long-time sky-watcher and satellite watcher. I've experimented with astrophotography and consider myself to be a sane and intelligent individual. Looking up, I noticed an extra \"star\" in the handle of the big dipper. I did a double-take thinking it must be a passing plane or satellite and watched as two lights about a degree apart went from being stationary and started moving West, then did an abrupt U-turn and shot out of sight at a speed that was remarkable. I don't know of any man-made phenomenon that would explain this."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
