{"Longitude":"-80.06969","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/14/2006 10:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-07152006-0010","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is an update to sightings we reported last night in Delray Beach, Florida. Here's a video of another unknown strange flying entity moving in as unusual pattern. It was shot looking to the east at 9:20PM I've also included a still image capture of a very large semi-transparent sphere just in the sky where I had my camcorder aimed. I did not see this object with the naked eye but when I viewed my video footage today this is what I saw. It���s a sphere and I have 15mins of footage of it. It disappears and reappears a bunch of times in the video. Sometimes just off in the blink of an eye and sometimes fades in and out and at one point it looks like it comes back in from the west to the same position. This stuff is being shot with the Sony DCR DVD-105 Camcorder with super nightshot plus and it sees stuff that the eyes don't in the dark. (It���s amazing!) This area is very active at the moment and hopefully I'll get some more great footage. Thanks JC"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Update to sightings on 7/14/2006 over Delray Beach Florida","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Delray Beach","Region":"Florida","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"26.468142","Case Number":"5081","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Delray Beach","There were 2 other sightings in Delray Beach on or around July 14th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"07/14/2006 10:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.468142,+-80.06969(5081)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5081) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5081.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/5081_submitter_file1__JC07142006sphere.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5081.html"]}
