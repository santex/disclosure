I then get my binoculars and thats when I knew it wasn't a star. The object was oblong with red, white & blue lights The colors of the lights were very bold I have never seen blue or red lights this intense. I watched it for a few minutes and it moved ever so slightly and then stopped and just stayed there. I went into our bedroom and woke my husband I think it was about 2:30 am. I told him I think there is a UFO out back he got up and he used the binoculars and saw the same thing. (I don't want to speak for him so I am only telling my story). After about 15 minutes we finally went to bed but it was still there. The reason I did not get a picture was because I only have a point & shoot camera that works and it was to far to show up. Since that night we keep looking to the sky."]}
