{"Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"saw unusual cloud, but realized that it was more like a rocket's contrail","divs":["Sighting DetailsDid not see the object that created this. I noticed it while driving that morning. It was a very tight vertical trail that ended in a cloudy plane. Lasted only 18-20 min before it dissipated. The skies were clear. I thought it might have been a cloud, or a smoke trail, but it was too thin and deliberate. There were spirals in the column, as if something was rotating while making the trail."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01232012-0005","Longitude":"-87.748546","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around January 18th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"01/18/2012 08:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.968028,+-87.748546(35067)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35067) map </A>","Tags":"City","City":"Chicago","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35067.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35067_submitter_file1__4-6E55D58E-1360659-800.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35067_submitter_file2__4-66B47ADC-1375160-800.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35067.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"41.968028","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"35067","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"01/23/2012 09:54 UTC"}
