It was about 11:20PM. I looked up and noticed noticed 6 or 7 red balls flying in \"formation\" heading up at the same trajectory and blinking in unison at times. it took me about 15 seconds to get my phone and start filming. There was no sound coming from the objects. They continued to rise until they all disappeared out of sight. Rather, they all quit blinking at the same time. I would have continued filming longer but my phones memory was full. I have never believed in UFOs, but I truly do not have an explanation for what I saw that night."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"30.345639","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There were no other sightings in Austin on or around October 19th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Austin","Tags":"City","Case Number":"52468","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.345639,+-97.714099(52468)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52468) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-97.714099","Date of the Event":"10/19/2013 11:22 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52468.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52468.html"],"Country":"United States"}
