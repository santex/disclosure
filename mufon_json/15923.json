{"divs":["Sighting DetailsJust walking home from buying some food at whole food sales and i noticed some lights in the sky not blinking. First it might be a plane but it was flying very low and it was huge. It flew right over the world trade center. I was amazed how it didnt make any noise flying so low and how big and triangluar it was. It also had these light on the back of the plane that lid up when it accelerated.
