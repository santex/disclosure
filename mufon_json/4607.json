I noticed a bright light in the sky. At first thought it to be atop a tower, but then realized there were no towers in that area so I began to look at it. It looked like a very bright star. Suddenly a ray of light (widening as it lengthened) emmerged from the star-like object. It only projected out a short distance. As it stopped projecting out, the end of this ray (at its widest & furthest point) turned to smoke, or a fog of some kind. The fog grew in size until it concealed everything (i.e. the ray & bright star-like object). Then it was gone. The strange thing was right after it disappeared I started to feel real sleepy..dreamy...only for a second or two. I immediately had the feeling someone was trying to make me believe I had halucinated the whole thing...who knows, maybe I did."],"Date Submitted":"07/31/2000 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"big bright star-suddenly emmitted a short ray of light-smoke gathered at end of ray-engulfed object-vanished","Date of the Event":"07/31/2000 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"42.26391","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Illinois"}
