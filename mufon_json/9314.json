When I noticed a meteor like object in the sky. I thought it was a meteor. Another appeared soon after I noticed the first. I then thought it might be a satellite entering earth orbit. They both seemed to burn out the reignite at different intervals. They both left a fire trail as a meteor would. They also changed direction. They appeared to be going in circle for a little bit. My girlfriend says that one object appeared triangular. We watched them for about 3 minutes. They then burned out or just went beyond our field of view."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Triangle","Region":"California","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"33.91847","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Brea","There were 3 other sightings in Brea on or around January 26th 2008"],"Summary":"meteor like to me.
