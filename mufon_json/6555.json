i went outside and this time there was a single very bright white light, shining like a star over my neighbors barn, who happens to be a detective with the nys troopers, and who was outside with his family observing and commenting in an excited way about the light\\object...it wasn't reflecting like the moon...it was shining, sparkling, or emitting light, and so bright, i could only see light, i could not see an object, just a source of light. i was looking slightly north of west, up at an angle of approx 35��� from the earth...the object was slightly smaller than my thumbnail extended at arms length...there were no other lights in the sky...i live in the country, there are no streets lights or other forms of light pollution. the object must have been quite low in the sky, because there was a low, visible cloud covering\\ceiling last night. i asked my wife to get my camera, a canon power shot s2-is (it gets a little weirder here). as i pulled the camera up to my eye, i was thinking i was going to have trouble finding the object in the viewfinder, shooting in total darkness and all. i was surprised to see the object, right there in the view finder, no problem at all finding it...i zoomed in some on the object and was i thinking; ���i'll take this picture, and then i'll take another with the flash up\\on and see if the object responds to it.��� i had the auto-focus on, and when i squeezed the shutter to focus, of course it shot out that green laser beam. then, just as, perhaps slightly before, the shutter went off (i have the camera set to make a sound like an old 35mm) and there was a slight delay in the shot because the camera had set the exposure to 1\\8 of a second���. right at that instant, just after i zoomed in, and just before the camera locked on and froze the image, a split second before the shutter went off, i saw in the view-finder the object change from a bright shining white light, to a blue sphere with white light shining through the blue with a blotchy sort look...it kind of looked like one of those pictures of the surface of sun, except it was blue...that's when the shutter went off...and that is what the picture shows. i can���t say if the object actually changed in appearance, or if it was the ���zooming��� that caused me to see it differently? my wife didn���t see what i saw, the change in the objects appearance from bright a bright white light, to blue sphere���she had just turned to shut the front door, it was chilly out, and when she turned back, she asked; ���where did it go?��� i could not see the object in the viewfinder anymore...it seemed to just disappear���.i didn���t even think i got anything on the exposure. i pulled the camera away from my eye to see if i could re-find the object without the camera. there was a glowing in the cloud cover where the object had been. i could hear my neighbor and his family saying to each other; ���did you see that?������everyone sounded quite excited, so were my wife and i. it looked as if the object was now above the clouds and illuminating them from above. although, i could not see anything of the object anymore, or make out any shape...just the clouds slightly illuminated from above where the object\\light had been. the illumination was growing fainter quite fast...so, i pulled the camera back up and tried to get a second picture...it doesn't show much...just looks like there���s some slightly illuminated fog. i haven���t talked to my neighbor yet. i hope to see him tonight, or perhaps this weekend. also, after i took the pictures���i remembered that i hadn���t yet changed my clock on the camera, which is why the time stamp is an hour off from my reported times. greg ps: when i first dowmloaded the pics from my camera, i could not see the object in the piture onmy monitor, just black. however, i could see it in the view-screen on the camera. i discovered my monitor settings(brightness & contrast) were off a little. after i adjusted the settings, i could see on the monitor what i can see on the camera. ps-2: i have cropped, enlarged, and auto-enhanced a photo. i can't see where to upload\\attach the photo on this extened form. i will try to send a follow up. i hope it all ends up at the same place?
