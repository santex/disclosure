There were orange lights around the mid section of the craft. Although I was driving down the interstate, I could tell the object was hovering in place. It appeared to be emitting a purple and green mist or dust of some kind. It was huge. I know I'm not the only person who witnessed it. It looked unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. I heard no noise since I was in my car. I couldn't keep the object in view because I was traveling too fast."],"Region":"Tennessee","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/06/2012 01:49 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"07/05/2012 11:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"large dome shaped objuct over downtown area","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.520071,+-86.576907(40295)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40295) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07062012-0010","Longitude":"-86.576907","Object Features":"Dome","Latitude":"35.520071"}
