I first noticed it when I got some shade when there wasn't a cloud in the sky. I just though the object was a speck. It was just hovering for a few minutes then just shot off like a speeding bullet multiplied by 50. I was just staring at it puzzled what it was for about 2 minutes, until I knew what it was so I took out my camera phone and got a few pictures with 12 times optical zoom, and when it was gone I thought I was just day dreaming. It flew away at incredible speeds."],"Sighting Duration":"04:39:19","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10955.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10955.html"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.312023","Date of the Event":"05/28/2008 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"26.014168","Tags":"City","Summary":"Black,circular, and had wings","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"10955"}
