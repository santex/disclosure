While walking, noticed extremely bright large starlike object to the south. Assumed it had to be a plane coming in although way too bright. Wanting to get a better look, walked about 4 steps to set down load under a tree, then stepped back to observe object and it was gone. Couldn't find it in another location, and if it had been an incoming plane it would have continued toward me in direction of airport and become larger. Had to be beneath clouds and th light was not a reflective type from sun, which was low and obscured anyway. Couple months ago, saw similar object in same general location, but at that time it was dark and object seemed to be jiggling. Thought that was a star, but next night it was not there."],"Region":"Wyoming","Case Number":"41303"}
