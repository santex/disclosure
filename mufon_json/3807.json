{"divs":["Sighting Detailsdate: approx. 11:55 pm sat, sept. 3, 2005. I had just finished watching auburn lose its season opener to georgia tech. i went outside where my wife had just pulled in the driveway from visiting a friend. i lit a cigarette and was sitting on the porch with her discussing her friend's impending divorce. the time was about 11:55 pm. i glanced into the cloudless night sky and saw what appeared to be a shooting star without its tracer racing from the south heading in a northern direction. i grabbed my wife's arm and pointed towards the object (she has never seen a meteorite and i was excited). it was high...looked to be skipping across the atmosphere at an extremely high rate of speed. it was orb-shaped, almost as if staring at a distant street light with a faint halo. the whole object had what i can only refer to as a faint, dark illumination surrounded by this halo. on either side, it had a brighter illumination similar to a faint satellite catching the suns rays two hours after sunset. it was almost triangular, but that could be my imagination. before i could say the words shooting star, it slowed tremendously and veered east in a pendulum motion, then north, then continued back to where it had first slowed in a southern direction. during this southern veer, three more similar objects appeared... one from the south, one from the southeast, and one from the southwest. one moment, they were not there, and the second moment they were. i did not see them race across the sky like the first object. they just suddenly appeared and slowed. all four converged on each other as if showing some kind of interest, forming a circle. then, they rotated counter-clockwise and diappeared instantly towards the north. all four vanished just as quickly as the three objects had appeared, almost like a meteorite burning out. i can honestly say that i have always been fascinated with the \"what if\" possibility of this sort of phenomenom, but have always said that i would not believe unless one landed in my yard and offered me a drink. my wife witnessed this same event, and even though her excitement was truly non-existent, i cannot say the same for mine. it has changed my beliefs. i immediately called my brother in north carolina and woke him up to tell him. i feel like i need to tell everyone i know, but at the same time, i don't want to become the weird person in the neighborhood. what i saw was amazing. all my life, i've looked at stars, planets, satellites, comets, and meteorites, and i can say i have never in my life seen something like this. it lasted approximately ten seconds, but honestly, it was probably even shorter than that. about ten minutes after the occurence, a jet high above plodded across the sky. the speed of these objects were 100's of times faster. it was as if they went from 5000 mph to 500 mph instantaneously. i am still somewhat in shock. i watch all of these \"crazy people\" report their abductions and their visitations on these shows that aire about ufos. like most of the population, i laugh at some of the stories we read and witness on tv. i don't know if i can laugh anymore. i don't know what to believe. i'm still amazed almost 18 hrs after the event. is that a common type of sighting? they weren't in my backyard... they were high above like a meteorite. wow"],"Log Number":"US-09042005-0005","Region":"Alabama","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"09/03/2005 11:55 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval, Teardrop, Triangle","Latitude":"34.7312","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3807.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3807.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.7312,+-87.70253(3807)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3807) map </A>","Summary":"Not Provided","Date of the Event":"09/03/2005 11:55 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Tuscumbia","There were no other sightings in Tuscumbia on or around September 3rd 2005"],"Longitude":"-87.70253","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Tuscumbia","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"3807"}
