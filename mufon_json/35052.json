Braddock Park. I observed a small pulsating strobe, extremely bright, fly from north to south (at about the same speed as a jet airliner) and then immediately stop and hover. A few minutes later, another object, much larger and cigar-shaped, flew from south to north (at about the same speed) at an incline to hover about another 5 degrees above and to the north of the first object. There is a large tree across the street and the small pulsating object was aligned with the top of the tree. The first object started out extremely bright white and gradually turned red before winking out. The second object pulsated various colors in a pattern, mostly white, blue and red. Altogether, the incident occurred over approximately twenty minutes, from about 6:20pm to 6:40pm on January 20, 2012."],"Summary":"observed 2 objects, 1 a pulsating bright light the other a cigar like shape pulsating various colors","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35052.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35052.html"],"Region":"New Jersey","City":"Bloomfield","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.795165,+-74.196208(35052)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35052) map </A>"}
