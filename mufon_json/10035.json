{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"New Mexico","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn March 23, 2008 at approx 12:55 to 12:58 PM , while looking at various high altitude jets and the contrails I notice a small bright white object about estimate 15000 to 25,000ft? It was at 55 degrees to the horizon facing and moving SW to a NE direction heading over and towards the north slope of the Sandia Mountains north of the city limits of Albuquerque. What I observed was what I though was a seagull or white bird catching thermals at a high altitude���the more I looked at it I notice a unusual side to side flight as if it was fluttering like a butterfly might fly. It was moving slow in a NE direction and notice it was blinking every one to three second intervals but at a location different from the other and no sound was heard���giving a fluttering appearance. At arms length the flash was the size of a button. The sighting seem to last two to three minutes before it was beyond the horizon from my view���.it was defiantly below the clouds and my guess is about the same altitude of private single or twin engine planes? I attempted to try and take photos with my cell phone but was unable to."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10035.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10035.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10035.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.090431","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Albuquerque","Tags":"City","Case Number":"10035","trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were no other sightings in Albuquerque on or around March 23rd 2008"],"Weather Factors":"Windy","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.090431,+-106.642927(10035)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10035) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/23/2008 12:55 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Small flashing light that seems to move or give a fluttering appearance....","Log Number":"US-03242008-0013","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-106.642927","Date Submitted":"03/23/2008 12:55 UTC"}
