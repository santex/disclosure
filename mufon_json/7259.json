We could not believe our eyes! It STOPPED! The light began too dim, then it was gone! It blended in with the rest of the stars! This ended up at the handle of the big Dipper. I don't know if it's just a coincidence but some-one witnessed a similar event in Colorado,the same night,and posted it on this web-site ,how strange.I witnessed this whole episode with my binoculars.Believe me you can see a lot more with binoculars than you can by your naked eye."],"Longitude":"-121.953293","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06192007-0013","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"NOT A SATELLITE !","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7259.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7259.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/17/2007 10:30 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Capitola","There were no other sightings in Capitola on or around June 17th 2007"],"Date Submitted":"06/17/2007 10:30 UTC"}
