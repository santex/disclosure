There was this bright light in the sky. I thought this was strange, because it was cloudy and there were no stars to be seen, but there was a bright light in the sky. I thought maybe the object was a plane or a hellicopter. The light was stationary, just a bright light in the sky. Today was the fourth time I have seen this light at the same time in the same place in the sky, in a week. Today was different, When I stopped for the red light I'm watching the light and it went out, like someone turned off a light switch. It just went away! At first I'm thinking , this can be explaned. It must be some kind of aircraft or I'm not really seeing what I think I'm seeing (a ufo). I was excited and scared! Has anyone else reported seeing this light in my area or I'm I going crazy?"],"Date Submitted":"09/11/2007 05:35 UTC","Latitude":"27.671747","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.671747,+-81.508434(7886)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7886) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
