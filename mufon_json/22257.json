{"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/10/2010 12:28 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watching chemtrails being made all around my house in Branford, CT. A lot of chemtrails were being made and I asked my friend what is that. He said a chemtrail and I said look below. I saw a white cigar shaped object, which is odd because I never heard of a white one. It was Southwest and proceeded to go north. I looked at it, ran up the driveway to take a picture. Took one picture that didnt come out good and when I was taking the second picture my hall-full batery camera completly died. I looked up and the object had disappeared into a chemtrail. Then TWO minutes later a grey or white helicoper came out of the tree line and it looked like it was looking for this object. I asked my friend if i should take a picture and he said no. As he said that a flash came from the helicopter. I have no idea what this was; maybe a government aircraft that just disappeared or something from out of this world. I don't know if this has a connection with chemtrails? Also, the object only lasted about 20-30 seconds before vanishing before my eyes."],"Summary":"White cigar shaped UFO disapears in front of my eyes","Latitude":"41.277893","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.277893,+-72.799397(22257)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22257) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Connecticut","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Branford","There were no other sightings in Branford on or around March 10th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","Date Submitted":"03/11/2010 01:13 UTC","Longitude":"-72.799397","Log Number":"US-03112010-0007","Tags":"City","Case Number":"22257","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22257.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22257.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"Branford"}
