She called me about an hour ago to tell me EXACTLY what she saw: She was leaving my house and heading home with her daughter. Which is a relatively short distance. She sounded scared on the phone and was afraid that she was going to sound crazy. As she was driving she saw a bunch of planes flying high in the sky and didn't think anything of it. But then one of the planes, or what she thought was a plane, dropped straight from the sky and started nosediving towards the Earth right in front of her. She said it got really really close and it scared the crap out of her. But then it froze in mid-air and was suspended there for a few moments... Hovering. Then just like that, it darted off to the right super-fast and disappeared. She said she was quite shaken up by the ordeal, especially with her one-year-old in the back seat!"],"Longitude":"-96.466971","Source":"MUFON","City":"Oakland","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.835826,+-96.466971(25928)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25928) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/16/2010 05:11 UTC","Case Number":"25928","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Oakland","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Wings, Unknown","Country":"United States"}
