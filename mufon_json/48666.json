The traffic light was red so we stopped. I told my child to look out her window we were on the small bridge and we can see people's fireworks. We saw a few fireworks going off when I noticed five balls of light that did not fade. I turned left when my traffic light turned green. I turned left and pulled off the road to the right on Nicholas Rd. The balls of reddish-pink light were still there. I watched the lights for several minutes. One off the objects kept moving back and forth between the other objects. Finally 3 of the objects took off and flew over to the right a short ways and then flew straight up and disappeared in the sky in like 2-3 seconds. At that time I got back in my car and drove home in excitement and called my friends and family to see if anyone else has seen what I had seen."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.215625","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-07052013-0040","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dayton","There were no other sightings in Dayton on or around July 4th 2013"],"City":"Dayton","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 10:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Ohio","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.732498,+-84.215625(48666)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48666) map </A>"}
