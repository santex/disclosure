As it got closer I realized the light was too high to be a headlight. We were traveling in a Chevy full size van, and as the object passed in front of our van I could see it was slightly higher than my eye level, it looked to be about 24 inches in diameter, with many antenna like rods sticking out all over. As the object passed silently in front of us out into the trees, neither gaining nor loosing altitude it disapearing. As it passed directly in front of us I would say it was at the most 100 feet in front of the van. My ex-wife and I both said \"Did you see that?\", we were dumbfounded. I know it wasn't swamp gas. Followed by \"what the hell was that?\" The object had not effect on the van or us that I could tell. It was a very curious event."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Some kind of probe if I had to guess.","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
