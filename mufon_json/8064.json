(imagine a paper plate with something very light on it say, a blob of ketchup) i looked around imagining that it might fall onto a car or a pedestrian. i pulled out my camera to see if i could zoom it to get a better look at the thing and where i thought it would land. my card was full so i couldn't figure out how to use that feature quickly. i turned back around from throwing the camera on the front seat of the car, looked to see how close it was to the ground and it had begun \"falling\" up. it was moving in the same manner but upwards,slightly faster than it had been \"falling\" and moving away from my position. as it rose higher and almost out of my sight, ( 20 seconds ish )the sun glinted off of it and i realized that it must've had some part of it that was shiny metal although it did not appear to have been shiny up until that point. i did not feel particularly scared, upset or what have you. i was just pretty curious. i can't get the image out of my mind though because it was just plain wierd. i can't imagine this was under intelligent control because of it's flappy type of movement but it wasn't windy enough for an object of any weight to be held aloft and propelled upward in that way. the whole thing took about one to one and a half minutes and the total movement of the object might be described as a straight downward fall then up and away at an apx. 70 degree angle."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8064.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8064.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Westfield","Object Features":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Westfield","There were no other sightings in Westfield on or around September 17th 2007"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"\" hubcap\" appeared to fall out of the sky then \"fell\" up and away."}
