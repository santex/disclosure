On my way back to the house I looked up and saw the two lights moving in unison from south west to north east. I am a mufon member so I am frequently looking up at the night sky whenever I am out at night. These lights were moving about the speed and altitude of the commercial airliners that I frequently see going over at night. They were passing a little north west of my position. What made these lights stand out was the fact that there was no normal aircraft strobes visible and they were moving in unison (one behind the other about thumb to forfinger apart at arms length ) with no discernable motion changes between them and no jet engine sound that I could hear. I was quite excited, I ran around to the north side of the house so as to not lose sight of them. I lost sight of them shortly after I moved as they went into the clouds that were north east of my position."]}
