Very dimlights traveling across the sky caught my peripheral vision. There were 4 or 5of them that seemed to come from a long object traveling very quickly from Northto South at about 60 deg from horiz. It was silent. I could see the lights for4 or 5 seconds then lost it in the glare from the Ford dealership lights. WhenI first saw I thought it was a shooting star but it was too dim and had too manylights. I watched the object rapt in curiosity. I let the dogs run around somemore then brought them in and told my wife what I saw."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/11/2001 11:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Pleasantville","There were no other sightings in Pleasantville on or around November 11th 2001"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Blimp","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Pleasantville","Date of the Event":"11/11/2001 11:00 UTC","Longitude":"-73.784709","Summary":"Saw long ship with very dim lights traveling very quickly.","Latitude":"41.138069","Log Number":"","Case Number":"1386","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1386.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1386.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:59"}
