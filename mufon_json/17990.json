At first i thought it was a plane flying by since planes frequently fly by my area. What caught my attention was that it was moving slower and in the wrong direction. As i was watching, the plane quickly changed directions. it created a sort of zig zag pattern before taking off in the direction that it came. I am confused as to what it was so i thought i would post it to see if anyone else saw it and could tell me what it was."],"Longitude":"-117.810337","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/09/2009 08:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"17990"}
