I was mesmerized and thinking how lucky I am to be seeing this. If anyone else saw this they would surely believe there is something out there. I looked in diff. parts of the sky during this event and saw nothing moving in order to confirm to me what I saw. \"WOW\", a once in a life time sighting. Has anyone else contacted you about this? I am not an idiot what so ever, what I saw ways real.There is no doubt in my mind I could possibly be wrong.I thought maybe there were some sat. placed to photo the eclipse until they started moving at right angles and stopping then moving again sometimes in diff. directions. I lost sight of the event when a fog bank started to move in the area."],"Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-82.547275","Log Number":"US-08282007-0005","Case Number":"7769","Region":"North Carolina","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Features":"Other","City":"Asheville","Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"35.604335","Source":"MUFON"}
