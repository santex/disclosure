He is afraid for his family and his own security. It has been published in youtube, and that is where i took this video from. I wish you at MUFON to see if this video, made with a security camera wth infrared capabilities, has any credibility or if it was not faked. In case you at MUFON find this video as being trustfull i am prepared to try and sort more accurate information on the witness so that an original record can be obtained. Most intriguing in this video is the cat which crosses the street."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-22.900329,+-43.205427(48104)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48104) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Region":"Rio de Janeiro","Country":"Brazil","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Rio de Janeiro","There were no other sightings in Rio de Janeiro on or around April 16th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48104.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48104.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/16/2013 05:45 UTC","Log Number":"BR-06132013-0008","Date Submitted":"06/13/2013 12:18 UTC"}
