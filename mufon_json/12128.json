We don't see very many in Orange County. Then I noticed a small circle of light traveling across the night sky. I knew it wasn't a plane because it had no other lights on it but also it was higher than any plane I've have ever seen. It was very high up in the sky but I could see it was traveling at a very high rate of speed as I saw it cover a long distance in a short amount of time. I don't believe it was a comet as I did not see any type of trail coming off it. Whatever it was it caught my attention."],"Date of the Event":"07/10/2008 08:30 UTC","Latitude":"33.891206","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.891206,+-117.809352(12128)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12128) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"12128","Tags":"City"}
