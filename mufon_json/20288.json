I had noticed how the full moon had made the stars rather hard to see. After a few minutes I was on my way back inside when I heard a bird chirp. I looked straight up and saw a large object with a dark shimmering appearance gliding directly overhead traveling fron North to South at what I would say was about 1000 ft and would estimate the speed at about 50 to 60 MPH. The closest comparison I can make to the shape is that of a B-2 although the slow flight speed and the fact that there was absolutely no sound baffles me. I watched it until it faded into the night sky at distance and never saw any lights on the object."],"Tags":"City","City":"Dallas","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11032009-0008"}
