Over the last week on two separate occasions I have seen between two and three strange lights in the southwest sky around 9:15 in the evening while I am on my deck. They look like planets and they stay stationary for around 30 to 40 minutes. The first time I noticed the lights they were changing colors from white to blue to red. On the last occassion it was solid white color. Both times after watching them for twenty minutes I would go inside and periodically check on them. Eventually forty minutes later they would be gone."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in East Haven","There were no other sightings in East Haven on or around September 23rd 2007"],"Date Submitted":"09/23/2007 09:20 UTC","City":"East Haven","Log Number":"US-09242007-0004","Latitude":"41.276208","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Connecticut","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.276208,+-72.868434(7987)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7987) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.868434","Case Number":"7987","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7987.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7987.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/23/2007 09:20 UTC"}
