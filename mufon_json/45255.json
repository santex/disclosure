It was a foggy night, as an amateur photographer using my iPhone, I took some pics of the street lights in the parking lot. Upon reviewing the pics I noticed the object in two pics I took one after the other, perhaps a second apart. I zoomed in and saw what looked like a structured craft with 2 lights on the bottom and perhaps a dome one top. In one Of the shots there is the smallest hints of portholes.( though I cant be sure). Because I took them within a second of each other, you Can see it was moving, and moving up."],"Object Shape":"Cylinder, Square, Rectagular, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45255.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45255_submitter_file1__image.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45255_submitter_file2__image.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45255_submitter_file3__image.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45255_submitter_file4__image.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45255.html"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Wayne","Summary":"Outside in parking lot of restaraunt...
