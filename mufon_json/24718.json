{"Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on a hike with my dad and our friends. I was just taking scenic photos of the hills with my Nikon Coolpix L18 camera. A few minutes later I went to look at some of the pictures and this one caught my eye. It showed up yellow in the first second of viewing the image on my camera. The camera highlighed it for a second so it caught my eye and I zoomed into it. My friends said it might have been a helicopter landing pad in the hills but none of us saw it when we looked back. I just wanted to see if you know what it is for sure. Thank you."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/23/2010 02:33 UTC","Log Number":"US-07232010-0002","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Long silver or white cigar shape with black around the edges.","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Malibu","There were no other sightings in Malibu on or around February 1st 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Malibu","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.007308,+-118.806939(24718)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24718) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24718.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24718.html"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"24718","Date of the Event":"02/01/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar, Oval","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-118.806939","Latitude":"34.007308"}
