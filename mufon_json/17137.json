I say exactly because this is the time that I usually leave for work every night. I work third shift as a Police Officer and as I do every night while walking to my garage, in uniform, I looked up at the sky to check the weather and gaze at the stars and constellations. It was a clear night and I did not observe any clouds in the sky. It had been a cooler day and I estimate that the temperature was around 55 degrees at the time of this incident. I opened my garage door and stood in my driveway facing westbound. As I looked up in the night sky, almost directly above me, I observed a very bright white spot. It appeared to be about the size of the biggest star that was in the sky, possibly slightly larger. It also appeared to be as bright as one of the brighter stars, say for instance the North Star. The object was traveling southbound, very smoothly, not losing or gaining altitude, and not traveling very fast. When I first observed it, like I always do with any object in the night sky, I tried to identify it in my mind. I thought to myself it seems to be moving at the speed of a typical passenger jet, but there were no blinking colored lights and it was far too bright. Then I thought, maybe the jet is coming right towards me and the spotlights in front of it are hitting my line of sight just right. But that didn���t seem to make sense as the object was moving southbound, causing me to begin to turn my head to the left to keep it centered in my line of sight. It was far too large to be a satellite and moved too fast. I then thought, maybe our (NASA) space shuttle, but no, that had landed a day before. So here I stood looking at this object, thinking to myself, is this really what I think it might be.., an actual unidentified flying object. I would estimate that I was watching this object for 20 to 30 seconds at most, and then the part I just can���t explain happened. Within 2 seconds it dimmed from a bright star like object to absolutely nothing, gone, vanished, while it was still in motion. It almost appeared like someone took a dimmer switch on a light and very steadily, but quickly turned it off. I stood there for a few seconds thinking did that really just happen? So I snap out of it.., wipe the grin off my face, and think, oh it probably just went behind a cloud. No, no clouds in sight, in fact it disappeared very close to a few stars. To convince myself even further I took my high powered flashlight off my duty belt and shined it up into the night sky. No clouds to be seen. So there I stood in my driveway, running late to work as usual, just witnessing this. I felt amazed. If I had the time I would have stood there for a while to see if it would reappear in another location in the night sky, but duty called. While driving to work all I could think about was how I had never seen anything like this before. Being close to 30 years old I���ve been looking at the night sky for quite some time. Never have I seen something disappear in the manner that this object did. Did this object suddenly shoot out into outer space and disappear from my vision? I don���t know. Thank you for listening to my story and I urge anyone in the area of my sighting to come forward if you have experienced something similar to what I saw. I would really like to hear from others who may have seen this and submit possible additional information."],"Date of the Event":"05/24/2009 10:15 UTC","Region":"Wisconsin","Latitude":"43.048382","Country":"United States","Case Number":"17137","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.048382,+-87.903674(17137)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17137) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/24/2009 10:15 UTC","City":"Milwaukee","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Bright star like object.
