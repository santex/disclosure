A friend was with me and we were driving down around Mineral Springs around Waxhaw, NC that was in the country and I don t remember seeing any other vehicles on the road that night. When we came across a ring of green lights my friend thought it was some kind of bugs which I said that it didn t look like bugs to me and when my car stopped running and my lights went out we decided to get out of the car and check out the green ringed lights coming down out of the sky. After that I don t remember much. I woke up in my bed fully clothed and there was probably about 4 hours of missing time and apparently I had taken my friend to his home neither one of us remembers anything at that point. My buddy still does not like to talk about it to this day. I had nose bleeds for a couple of months after that. No alcohol or drugs was involved."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Indian Trail","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.669235"}
