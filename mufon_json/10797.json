I saw a dozen balls of light in the sky converging into a center point, pulsating outward and retracting back to center. This went on for over an hour. There were two searchlights on the distant northern and southern horizons but I was uncertain if they could have caused this detailed pattern of light for such a prolonged period. The light reflected off clouds. I've seen searchlights before but never this unusual pattern of light expanding and retracting. The sensation I had was that this was highly unusual. (I've seen UFOs before - seven clearly visible disks at Mt. Shasta CA)"],"Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"39.742544","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-104.975333","Source":"MUFON","City":"Denver","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/17/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Flash, Unknown","Log Number":"US-05182008-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.742544,+-104.975333(10797)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10797) map </A>"}
