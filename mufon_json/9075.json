{"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/31/1976 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were traveling from Houston to Tulsa. It was a clear night with no moonlight. As we crossed the state border I noticed a bright light approaching from the rear. There was no noise. Being a pilot myself, I assumed that it was an aircraft that had lost power and was going to use my headlights to land in the road ahead of me. Then the light got brighter than anything I had ever seen. The countryside was lit up like a gigantic football field. I just kept driving. It hovered over us for a minute or two. Then it left at a speed that would not be possible for any aircraft. About five minutes later we saw a bright light moving across the horizon. Again, the speed was way beyond what could be achieved by any known aircraft."],"City":"Okmulgee","Log Number":"US-01202008-0009","Region":"Oklahoma","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Okmulgee","There were no other sightings in Okmulgee on or around August 31st 1976"],"Summary":"A bright white light hovered over my car for about a minute","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Latitude":"35.623437","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.623437,+-95.96055(9075)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9075) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9075.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9075.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-95.96055","Date of the Event":"08/31/1976 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"9075"}
