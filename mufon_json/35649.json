He was showing a bottle of pinesol with a wand and how stains dissapeared majically. After seeing this i went across the street and bought some fabrisolv, and polished my computer. I remember needing something from my purse as i noticed that my wallet was not there. I recall thinking that maybe my wallet had telaported somewhere after using the fabrisolv Two weeeks later i recieved a fedex as the package had indeed my returned wallet. The return address was from the store, bath and beyond. I knew i did not shop there, so how did this happen? Maybe my walllet teleported to a ufo they may have. ALl my credit cards were there, even my laundry card was there, and only some cash under $20 was missing...unfortunatly my expensive alienware computer stopped working after using this fluid cleaner. My disc drive compleatly no longer reconized its own hardware."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/18/2010 04:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35649.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35649.html"],"Longitude":"-77.031166","Latitude":"38.899992","Log Number":"US-02122012-0012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.899992,+-77.031166(35649)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35649) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"telaport","Case Number":"35649","Region":"District of Columbia","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/12/2012 06:28 UTC"}
