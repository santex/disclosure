{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn December 24th my husband and I were returning home from visiting our daughter at approximately 7:30 and we noticed what appeared to be a very bright star to the right of the full moon. I took a picture with my digital camera and when I zoomed in to the object it was not a star. I took a second picture thinking something might have been on my lens. The object appeared again except the shape was slightly different. It seemed to have moved around a bit. It looked like a gold metal object with legs. My husband said it reminded him of a chandelier. It had to be very large because the full moon did not drown it out. We watched it for about 15 minutes and then went inside the house because it was very cold. I don't know how long it was up there. I would appreciate any information as to what this object might be."],"Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Colorado","Log Number":"US-01072008-0001","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-104.606101","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/24/2007 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.257357,+-104.606101(8797)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8797) map </A>","Latitude":"38.257357","Case Number":"8797","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"star like object seen near full moon.
