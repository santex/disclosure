IT WAS ABOUT 1.5 MILES AWAY AT A HEIGHT OF APPROXIMATED 1500 TO 2000 FEET. A FRIEND OF MINE SAW THE OBJECT TOO. IT APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT ILLUMINATED WITH THE BOTTOM PORTION EMITTING THE MOST LIGHT. IT MADE NO NOISE WHATSOEVER. I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES AND THEN BRIEFLY TURNED AROUND TO FACE THE FOOTBALL FIELD (EAST). WHEN I TURNED BACK AROUND A MINUTE LATER IT WAS GONE. AT FIRST I WAS TRYING TO DETERMINE IF WAS A HELICOPTER OR A BLIMP OR A BALOON. IT MADE NO NOISE AND SO I RULED OUT IT BEING A . HELICOPTER. IF IT WAS A BALLOON OR BLIMP IT WOULD MOVE A LITTLE BIT AND IT WOULD NOT DISAPPEAR SO FAST. THERE IS A WEB SITE SOMEWHERE ON THE INTERNET THAT SHOWS TYPICAL UFO SHAPES AND A PHOTOGRAPH SOMEONE TOOK OF A SIMILARLY SHAPED UFO. IT WAS THE SPITTING IMAGE OF WHAT I SAW IN SAINT JO BUT, UNFORTUNATELY I CANT FIND THAT PARTICULAR SITE AGAIN."],"Summary":"SAW A HOVERING CYLINDER- LIKE OBJECT DURING HALFTIME AT SAINT JO HIGH SCHOOLS HOMECOMING FOOTBALL GAME","Date Submitted":"09/10/2009 11:49 UTC","Longitude":"-97.522524"}
