At first I thought it was high elevation plane, but then I noticed its disk-like shape. When I seen it, it came from west and went in a straight line to the north. I was only able to see for a few seconds before it sped over a small Cirrus cloud and instead of showing up on the other side of the cloud, it vanished. When I seen it I was both surprised and confused."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-09112012-0021","Latitude":"42.742342","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-82.725033"}
