I am a Wedding DJ who was doing a Wedding Reception for about 200 people at Avila Beach Resort in a large tent. I went out the side door of the tent to ask when the buffet would start and as I went around the outside of the tent employees of the the Avila Beach Resort asked me what is that as they were pointing to the sky, I looked up and I viewed a disc shaped object floating in the sky. I viewed this object for about 7 minutes trying to figure out what it was? I returned to the Wedding Reception as I needed to continue playing music, the wedding photographer was doing a slide show and I could not bother him to take photos. I believe this to be a no fly zone and expected to hear jet's (I did not hear any)"]}
