We saw a star like UFO glowing. And it was on a clear sky day. Fist we thought its a star. But we can identify the object is not very far only a mile distance because we can see the other stars in the sky. The object fist glowing like a star and after 20-30 sec its shape changed to a golf ball with yellow color. And again it glowing like a star and then after its shape changed to golf ball with yellow color. This happened four times and suddenly disappeared. Noted other incidents: I have been watching sky over 4 months April - Aug 2013. 4-5 times I have seen ball shaped object moving over the sky with no sound in yellow color. These objects were like a fire ball and slowly moving without any sound. I can recognize this because planes and helicopter are usually moving around the sky making sound and I can see the shape also. So now a days every day I am watching sky... I don't have a camcorder to record this, I already book one and will be getting it soon."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=12.878802,+77.621393(50290)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50290) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Star like UFO","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"IN-08302013-0005","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Bangalore","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Karnataka","Case Number":"50290","Date of the Event":"08/27/2013 08:05 UTC","Longitude":"77.621393","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Other","Latitude":"12.878802"}
