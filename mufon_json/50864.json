I was in a hammock laying back watching the sky, talking around 6 o' clock. My friend was in a chair then, as i was watching ramdomnly up into the sky I saw a white thing going really fast leaving a bright white long tail behind going from the back part of the house to the front side of the house.my friend was able to see it too. These unidentified flying thing was significantly closer than what airplanes usually do and considering the distance, you see airplanes going kind of slowly from one side to another while they are going fast enough to travel but this thing went really fast from one place to another. Afterwards we just saw a white thing farther than the first one in front of the house and couldnt tell if it is related to the first thing we saw or not starlike"],"Object Shape":"Diamond, Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Guayaquil","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"State of Mexico","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/14/2013 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Summary":"watching ramdomnly up into the sky I saw a white thing going really fast leaving a bright white long tail behind","Case Number":"50864","Longitude":"-99.017428","Country":"Mexico","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"EC-09162013-0019","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50864.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50864.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.592373,+-99.017428(50864)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50864) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/16/2013 09:00 UTC"}
