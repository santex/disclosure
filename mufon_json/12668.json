I guess I was in the right place at the right time! All the pictures seem to show the object coming closer to me then going out on the lake,coming back and speeding away as balls of green and purple light came from it.This was definately an amazing thing to have caught on film!"],"City":"Lorain","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"12668","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Unknown","Summary":"UFO over Lake Erie in Lorain,Ohio","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09202008-0008","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Lorain","There were no other sightings in Lorain on or around September 17th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
