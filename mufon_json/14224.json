It moved in L shaped movements. This was near fort custer military reserve. It moved unlike any aircraft I had seen before. I thought it might be a \"harrier\" or an experimental craft. It looked a lot like the depiction in the Belgian sightings, that is why I bothered let you know. This was a long time ago, so I might have the year wrong, but I remember it was really late, and in the late fall. I was riding in the back seat of my friend's car on the 94 freeway. It appeared right in my line of sight over the tree line; it was bright. I thought it was a UFO, but figured out over time it could have been a \"Harrier\" Jet. It was 3 firery rings and moved with more \"snap\" than a chopper. Very fast, and it moved in L-shaped movements. I asked my friend if she saw it, and she said no. It fell under the tree line when I lost sight of it. (it must have landed)"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/18/1998 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14224.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14224.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/18/1998 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Climax","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12042008-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.238376,+-85.334995(14224)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14224) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Climax","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.238376","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-85.334995","Case Number":"14224"}
