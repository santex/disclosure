{"Summary":"Again same White spherical object moving very slow south.","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt around 4:58pm on Sunday, November 1st I was outside taking pictures of the natural landscape as I am prone to do when I spotted a white round object moving in the sky at about 88 degrees from the horizon ( North ). The object remained moving south very slow in the sky and I quickly started taking pictures of it. I was able to take 6 pictures in RAW (CR2)and 6 in JPEG before the objet desapear. Strangely enough the object was very similar in appearance to the previous object that I captured on October 11th and October 24 of this year (as reported to the ufo center previously) except that this time it was moving south."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20253.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20253_submitter_file1__IMG_0877.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20253_submitter_file2__IMG_0878.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20253_submitter_file3__IMG_0879.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20253.html"],"Log Number":"US-11012009-0023","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"West Palm Beach","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.724412,+-80.052135(20253)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20253) map </A>","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in West Palm Beach","There were no other sightings in West Palm Beach on or around November 1st 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"20253","Longitude":"-80.052135","Date Submitted":"11/01/2009 06:24 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"11/01/2009 04:58 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"26.724412"}
