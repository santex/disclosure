This time this object slows turns towards me making a c pattern while doing so! When it gets closer to me it is barely moving, I happen to have a walking stick with me and I took it and started pounding on my deck steps, trying to get my wife to come outside!! The object starts turning back away towards se direction and finally is just s bound towards the top of closest mountain!! So , I started up my steps in a quick walk without taking my eyes off of it . When I got close to the top step the object just dissapeared !!! I don't know what happened it made me mad too ! Because my wife missed it by about 15 seconds , I was so mad I cussed her !!! Where were you? I could've been having a stroke or broke my leg down the steps!! The object could've just shut its lights off and stopped to watch me ? It didn't cross the hill , it wasn't close enough!! The lights on this or the whole thing changed shape,3 times!! As soon as I got in the house I wrote down everything , the shapes time date , direction speeds , anything that might help ! I've done this on the big sightings , like if they fool with or interact with me , it has paid off in the past, on one case mufon confirmed that about the same time just one county over, someone reported the same thing !! I was told someone would come from mufon to see me , that never happened, sorry guys but its the truth!! If you don't believe me check out sightings in Minnie and McDowell ky!!! That's me!! Somthin strange is going on in the bluegrass state, and nobody cares???????"],"City":"McDowell","Longitude":"-82.747219","Date Submitted":"05/05/2013 10:59 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in McDowell","There were no other sightings in McDowell on or around April 25th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47201.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05052013-0029","Object Flight Path":"Other","Latitude":"37.473734","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Star-like, Other, Unknown","Summary":"Object was traveling in straight line until I put my flashlight on it then it changed direction toward me !!
