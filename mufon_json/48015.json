We live in the country and it is very dark at night. I was watching for meteors when I saw what I thought was a satelite coming out of the west, moving east. It was larger than the satelites we usually can observe and was not on the same path they usually follow tho. It appeared to be exactly overhead when it made an abrupt downward turn and brightly flared. It then resumed it's original trajectory but the glow faded and I lost sight of the object. I am totally convinced that I witnessed a re-entry. I felt very elated, hoping that it was our technology."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48015.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48015.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/09/2013 10:39 UTC","Summary":"thought it was large satelite until it abruptly came straight down for a second or two, then resumed original trajector but glow faded","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.550495,+-83.817148(48015)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48015) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Case Number":"48015","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","City":"Monticello","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Monticello","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-06092013-0033","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"09/23/2011 11:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"30.550495"}
