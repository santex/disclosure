I had a UFO experience when I was 8 years old at the time and I am now 35. I am e-mailing to you, because I would to try to find out if there was any other UFO activity reported around the time that I had my sighting. It was in 1982, it was in the late spring, early summer in Easton Pennsylvania. My sister, uncle and I ad gone for a walk in the early evening and we stopped to rest in a field above the road. As we were laying there I saw this object just hovering above us. I remember feeling very calm and quit comfortable at this sight. I am trying to find away to put into words what the UFO looked like, but I am struggling with it. I have never seen anything described anywhere that looked like what I saw. I have talked to my sister and my uncle and they are trying to remember, but at this moment they can not. All I want is to understand what I saw for myself. It would be greatly appreciated, if your team could help. Thank You for taking the time to read my e-mail. Much Appreciated, Jody Snyder"],"Log Number":"US-07162009-0013","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Easton","There were no other sightings in Easton on or around May 25th 1982"],"Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown"}
