The larger object was somewhat triangular. They moved very slowly in the same direction for about two minutes before fading into light cloud cover. I first noticed it because it was moving so slowly. I found that odd and continued to look assuming it was just a plane. When I realized it was two objects then I really got curious. I thought perhaps it was a glider, but that wouldn't make since for the area, and also wouldn't explain the second smaller object in front of the larger one. I managed to record just under a minute of video, but it was very hard to see it recorded. I lost sight of the objects when they faded into the light clouds in the distance."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Case Number":"48103","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Sumter","There were no other sightings in Sumter on or around June 12th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Sumter","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48103.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48103.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.943702,+-80.346106(48103)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48103) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
