{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband went outside with his telescope to show me Saturn. He came back inside and said there was something strange in the sky. I rushed outside and saw a bright orange somewhat triangle shaped object moving to the west. It was not that high in the sky and made no noise. It didn't have any blinking lights. We watched it until it just disappeared. It didn't fade off into the distance - it just disappeared into thin air. I can say it was NOT a helicopter - saw and heard one the night before - and it was NOT a plane. We also noticed that there wasn't any wind or aircraft in the sky at the time of the sighting."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.606358,+-90.499938(48718)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48718) map </A>","Region":"Missouri","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Manchester","There were no other sightings in Manchester on or around July 4th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07062013-0005","City":"Manchester","Latitude":"38.606358","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/06/2013 01:09 UTC","Longitude":"-90.499938","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 09:00 UTC","Summary":"Bright orange object flying west of Manchester MO","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"48718","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48718.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48718.html"]}
