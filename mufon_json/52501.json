4) i also thought about the possibility it was a drone since there is a lot of talk about drones these days. it seemed a little larger than i would expect of a drone, but i don't know a lot about them. it did have an engine sound, although quieter and less of a rumble than i would normally expect from aircraft of that size. technology is ever changing, so who knows. at this point i have not been able to put a name to what i saw, so it is (to me) a ufo. would love to know if there is a valid explanation or if anyone else saw what i saw that night."],"Case Number":"52501","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","Summary":"Observed triangle shapped object with 3 steady white lights on underside also in triangle pattern","Region":"New Jersey","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Southampton Township","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"39.934002","City":"Southampton Township","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-74.748494","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Other","Date Submitted":"11/29/2013 02:52 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/20/2013 06:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-11292013-0017","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52501.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52501.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
