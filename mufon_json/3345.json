As I looked up, something caught my attention coming out of the general southeastern direction. It looked like a star but it was moving...I kept looking to see if it was a high altitude plane and I listened to try and hear the jet engine but didn t hear a thing. I then noticed the object had suddenly (it seemed) begun heading in an almost due northern pattern. It might have been a high altitude jet since I live underneath a fairly active flight zone but what I saw didn t lead me to think it was the usual aircraft. Just don t know what I saw but I definantly saw something."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/09/2005 02:35 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/09/2005 02:35 UTC"}
