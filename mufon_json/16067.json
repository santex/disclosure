{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI can not smoke inside so I go out everytime I smoke and have never seen anything like this. I live by KCI airport and I was in the air force so I have seen airplanes, both civilian and military and I know what can and shouldn't be able to be done by our technology. I was looking up and saw one moving item in the sky after being outside for no more than 20 seconds and I assumed it was an airplane so I looked away to find something else interesting to look at... I look back to the airplane moments later and then the main light which looks like a halogen airplane light blink off with no afterglow. Remaining is a green strobe light on the object, then within one minute after it staying in place it just shoots up into the sky and is gone within 2 seconds. I was looking NW from my back porch to see this object. Worth note: Less than 5 minutes later there are several military planes flying around!!!
