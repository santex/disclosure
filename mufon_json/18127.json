However, these lights were different. They were much higher in the sky and traveled along the horizon from south to north in a straight line. As each object got to a particular point they would slow down then disappear to the east. There were a total of five orange balls with the first three closer to each other than the last two. There was no flashing or pulsing in the lights just a large (though they could have been miles away) orange glowing light. I remained outside for about thirty minutes afterward but no other objects were sighted."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.544636,+-81.377066(18127)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18127) map </A>","Latitude":"28.544636","Log Number":"US-07162009-0019"}
