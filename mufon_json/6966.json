{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe craft was a perfect Charcoal color triangle with a round Azure Blue light at each cornor of the triangle. It was leisurly heading south down river. I had not time to view it but a few seconds because I had to pay attention to the traffic which was heavy due to a work project going on which narrowed the East bound traffic to one lane on the Bridge. When I had a chance to look again, I could not locate the craft and still had to return my eyes to the road. It was approximatly 9:30PM.
