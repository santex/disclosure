{"divs":["Sighting DetailsStanding on my porch like I do every night checking the sky while I smoke. Say a bright red light traveling along but was not blinking at all from nw to ne . I hollered to my daughter to get out here so she could see it.It was getting closer and I just about got a good view nnnn it disappeared. Frustrated and freezing I waited as long as I could but never reappeared for me. Trust me I was checking out the skylights and poking my head out the front door for the rest of the afternoon. Still no luck."],"City":"Emmett","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.876398,+-116.490861(44867)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44867) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/30/2012 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/31/2012 04:34 UTC","Summary":"Steady Bright red wight light moving from nw/ne then vanish","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-116.490861","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44867.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44867.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Emmett","There were no other sightings in Emmett on or around December 30th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Idaho","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12312012-0007","Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"43.876398","Case Number":"44867","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
