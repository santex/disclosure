We watched it, and we knew it wasn't airplane because it was so close to the ground and it was arcing toward the ground, in a parabolic arc, nothing like the path of an airplane. We were shocked when we saw it, too shocked to think about taking a picture until it was too late. It went below the tree line after about 3 seconds and we lost sight of it for good."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27296.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27296.html"],"City":"Blue Bell","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-75.260469","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Blue Bell","There were no other sightings in Blue Bell on or around January 7th 2011"],"Latitude":"40.156431"}
