I parked the car and got out to look at this better. It was large,pulsating,oval shape and very bright orage. It began to move and went over my house and the house behind me, I watched this object until it went completely out of site. This object made no sound whatsoever. It was not flying very high. As it went over my house it started picking up speed. It came in from the south and headed north until I could not see it anymore. I had called my son who was in the house to come out and see this, but when he got out, which was a few seconds this bright orange pulsating moving object was gone. This was not an airplane. I live close to an airport here and I see planes all the time. Let me tell you this object was no way a plane. I sure wish I could find out what this was."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
