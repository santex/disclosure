Suddenly did I felt like I should give birth. I wasn't pregnant but I felt anyway I should give birth. I lay me down at the floor with pillows behind my knees. But I started to bleeding so much so I had to go and standing in the bath-tub. I had no cramp or pain. And out from me come two after birth plasmas ! They were grey purple and big as a mans hands so I think it was 9 month birth plasma. I lay it in a plastic bag with water and when my husband come home in the morning I said that he had to take me to the hospital. The Doctor checked me out and said he couldn't see I have been pregnant and thought it was menstruation bleeding. In his office did I gave him the plastic bag and asked him if I haven't given birth. He was shocked and send it to research but I never heard back from them again."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"56.758324","Date Submitted":"11/30/1989 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=56.758324,+15.271361(7650)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7650) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7650.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7650.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"SE-08122007-0006","Case Number":"7650","Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City","Country":"Kingdom of Sweden","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
