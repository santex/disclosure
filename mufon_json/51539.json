When we were cleaning up after the BBQ I told my daughter to look up at the beautiful blue sky. As I said that looking west I notice an object flying over the tree tops toward us. There were 5 of us and our dog that witness this event. The object had a shape to it, but was see true. It seem to have a white glow to it , but you could see true it. My girlfriend asked is that a plane when the object was directly over head, and as she ask that question the object while continuing its direction of travel turnt 180 and continued eastward without a sound till we couldn't see it anymore because of the trees on the other side if the river. It was 20 degrees celcius . Not a cloud in the sky. I've been a amateur astronomer for many years, and never seen something unexplained before. I really don't know what this object is."],"Log Number":"CA-10142013-0011","Date of the Event":"10/06/2013 02:20 UTC","City":"Miramichi","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51539.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51539.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Region":"New Brunswick","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
