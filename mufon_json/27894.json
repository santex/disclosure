I pulled into my apartment complex and saw out of the top of my vision a fast moving object. When I first saw it I thought it was a plane or a falling star, but noticed it was far too bright to be a plane. The light was very bright and clear. I stopped my car and looked up and it was traveling very fast, then all of the sudden dissappeared. When it dissappeared, a bright flash of light about 5 times the size of the light appeared then dissappeared very fast. I've seen a lot of falling stars, but this one was very different. The light was very strange compared to other lights you normally see at night."],"Log Number":"US-02192011-0002","Summary":"Bright white star like object moving very fast, then disappearing in a bright flash.","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like, Teardrop","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
