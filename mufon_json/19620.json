I grabbed my camera and jumped in to my car and went to my friends house who lives ca 900m from me. When I arrived, there were tree people all watching the bright light over the treetops that was on west (it was already dark, the sky was clear and lot of stars were on the sky) My friend parents were the ones who first discovered the object when being outside, they said, that at first it emitted a strong purple light quite blinding to look and seemed to be a lot closer and about a half of a meter big on the sky, after first discovering it they asked their daughter (my friend) to also come out to look at it. My friend told that by the time that she arrived she saw three lights that were positioned making a triangle shape and flashed red and purple tones not on regular manner. Lights also seemed to rotate so the triangle formation of the craft was understandable. By the time I arrived to the scene they had monitored the object for some 15 min and told that it had moved quite a way further (was now viewable about 20cm above treetops, the trees were some 50m from us. So overall, it was some 1,5m above horizon. We looked the object for some 30 min, and during that time, it was slowly moving away from us to the west and seemed to rotate etc because different colors of lights were seen, it also made sudden erratic movements on several occasions and the observation was turning to be very interesting when out of nowhere bright dots started to be appearing further away on right side and left side of the object for some time an then vanished. About 30 min later, the object was moved so far to the west that was dropping behind the treetops, so me and my friend decided to go to the car and drive some 2km futher to the west to the other side of the forest. We drove to the other side of the forest and parked the car on the side of the road, the object was still viewable, but it was now went much futher away and was noticeable only as a bright dot (about 30cm higher than the horizon) we monitored it for about and hour, and in that time frame it still had periods when it was emitting different kind of colors oand seemed to turn. After an about 20min of slowly descending to the horizon, it suddenly made some erratic movements to the right, left and down (felt like filming something bright and then shaking a camera) and was getting brighter again, so we thought it is moving back at us. We were alone on the middle of dark road away from houses and it was getting quite ....scary :) at this moment. However, a cloud formation was then coming between the object and us, we watched for about 15min more and then decided to go home, before that however we saw few bright flashes near where the object was, probably so far away and behind the clouds it was not seen any more. So for a conclusion: *It was a object with bright lights and shaped like a triangle. *It was seen on Estonia, P���rnu, at around 22:00 on 23.09.2009 moving to the west *There were four witnesses monitoring the object for about an hour. *It seemed to turn over it axis at some times and was making sudden \"jumps\" like it had no weight, so it definitely was not a satellite, plane or anything like that I have previously seen in the sky that was explainable. The witnesses seeing when it was closer said it was a triangle with different colors of bright lights. *I have about 20min of video footage of that observation, most of it is just black screen with observers comments on the background, it was just so dark that the compact camera had no focus lock, I managed to get some 10-15 seconds of a footage of the bright object after configuring the camera to manual focus lock. It shows a bright flashing dot when zooming in. When I downloaded the video into editing program and sharpened it, then when looking frame by frame there are several frames where there can be seen, that the object had three lights on rectangular shape. *When it was closer, there were some bright dots appearing on the sky near it at times that disappeared after few seconds. * Not knowing how big the object was, i would guess, that when I started observing it it was some 20km away and in the end of it some hundreds of km away. The comment from my friends parents were that at first it was almost straight top of them and was some half a meter long."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Triangle hig on sky with green, purple, red lights moving slowly to north.
