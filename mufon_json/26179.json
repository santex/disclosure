I saw an orb or a white starlike object floating extremely SILENTLY over our house about 3 or 4 hundred feet. Just above another plane that past just under it. We yelled and whistled at it to get it's attention hen about 10 seconds later it burned out in 4 seconds. NO FAA LIGHTS WERE SEEN. Plus as a plane approaches its headlights are bright and visible then as it passes it dissipates. Not so with this UFO. It was bright in all directions. Chrystal clear night and I know aircraft like the back of my hand. It was way to close not to hear or see any structure or FAA lights operating. This was an advanced craft of some kind! Incredible! My first real sighting!"],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.295065,+-76.610289(26179)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26179) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Baltimore","There were no other sightings in Baltimore on or around October 28th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26179.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26179.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/28/2010 11:48 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Maryland","Source":"MUFON","City":"Baltimore","Latitude":"39.295065","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-76.610289","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10282010-0028","Summary":"A craft about as bright a Jupiter SILENTLY hovered 300 feet across the sky over our house and then after yelling at it, it burned out.
