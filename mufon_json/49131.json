{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside the shop to have a cigarette. I noticed how pretty the sun looked behind the clouds and decided to take a picture. I didn't like that the first one had the trailer a connex box in it, so I walked out into the field and took another. I uploaded the photo (portrait layout) to Facebook and noticed the unknown object in the picture. I didn't actually see it before the picture because the sun was bright. I have both pictures (uploaded), taken maybe 30 seconds apart. Photos taken with my iPhone 4."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.025171,+-121.576364(49131)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49131) map </A>","Object Features":"Dome, Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/23/2013 08:44 UTC","City":"Gilroy","Summary":"Tood a picture of the sunrise, posted it to facebook and noticed this.","Log Number":"US-07232013-0007","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.025171","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49131.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49131.html"],"Region":"California","Longitude":"-121.576364","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Gilroy","There was one other sighting in Gilroy on or around July 23rd 2013"],"Case Number":"49131","Date Submitted":"07/23/2013 11:42 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Oval","Tags":"City"}
