There was a bright light on the eastbound lanes. I thought it might be a giant truck with bright, bright lights about the size and brightness of 25 headlights. There was an accompanying humming sound. Then the top of a tree in the middle of all the highways burst into flames and as I drove by, it continued to burn. Then the light was gone. I just on to work and everybody else kept driving too. So did anybody else see this? I was startled by the light and the fire. I thought everyone saw it but was ignoring it. I was a little scared but I just drove on to work, like everyone else. When I drove by the spot after work, I didn't think about the spot and didn't look for the tree. :("],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Kansas","Case Number":"21942","Log Number":"US-02192010-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.990328,+-94.665212(21942)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21942) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Overland Park","Date Submitted":"02/19/2010 08:36 UTC"}
