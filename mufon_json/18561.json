We noticed some windsurfers and stopped the car on the side of the road and got out to take this picture. I sensed something. I have always been interested in ufo's. We noticed the two disc shaped objects above the windsurfers when we put them on the computer after we got home to Dickinson, North Dakota. Seeing these two objects just made my day! I would like to share this picture with anyone interested in ufo's. Thank you!"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Seal Beach","There were no other sightings in Seal Beach on or around July 11th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"33.750606"}
