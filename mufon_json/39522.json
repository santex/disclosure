As soon as I looked at it, it just dropped out of the sky and seemed to shoot itself forward into the sky (south from where I was looking). Then it just faded away. My husband caught the tail end of what I saw. I've also seen a purple \"star\" do the same thing except move west to east in the sky. Both with in a matter of 10 seconds or less."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"San Diego"}
