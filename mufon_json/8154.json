Me and a friend were commenting on how odd it is too see two jets cross paths like that and so on. Then I seen a white,round object very high in the sky,and told my friend to check it out. It wasnt moving just staying in the same place,and \"Hovering,\" I guess. So I went and told a few others to check it out. we were watching it for a couple minutes,and I noticed another one to the west,doing the same thing,both identical in color and size. I went to get more people to see it,(cause I had no clue as to what it was,) And when I got back they were both gone. that fast. They were hard to see unless you just happen to be staring into the sky where they were. So I doubt anyone else may have seen them."],"Latitude":"40.494747","Region":"Indiana"}
