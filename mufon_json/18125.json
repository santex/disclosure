It was basically at the same altitude or lower as a passenger jet, which fly over my house all the time since I live approximately 60 miles south of the Ottawa airport. I know that passenger jets have flashing red and white lights but this didn't have any. I called my boyfriend outside to look so that I would have another witness. Two friends of mine that live about 3 miles from me also said that they saw the same thing and agree that it definately was not an airplane. After a couple of minutes the object flew into some clouds (not above them) and then we couldn't see it any more. I honestly don't know what it was and was actually quite surprised when I saw it. It basically looked like a very large star, brighter than the surrounding stars."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"CA-07162009-0017"}
