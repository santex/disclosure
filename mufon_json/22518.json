{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was travling south on US31 in Tipton Co. I noticed what I thought was a plane to the southwest. It was travling northeast. Mabye about a 1000 ft up. The light was white, and I kept looking for the flashing lights like on a plane. As I watched, it crossed right over my car still heading northeast, and I still couldn't see any lights blinking. I had my camera and wanted to get a picture. So I pulled over to the east on a county road, got out of the car, and it was gone. It was twlight out, and the sky was totally clear. It was just gone. I thought if it was a plane, I could have still seen it. The whole thing only lasted mabye 3-5 minutes, but I stayed out in the country another 20 minutes watching the sky in case it re-appeared. But I didn't see anything else. I'm reporting this, just in case someone else saw it too, and will know what it was, or come forward with more information."],"City":"Sharpsville","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-86.080681","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.386642,+-86.080681(22518)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22518) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/27/2010 01:03 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Sharpsville","There were no other sightings in Sharpsville on or around March 26th 2010"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.386642","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22518.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22518.html"],"Summary":"White light, thought it was a plane at first, but it dissapeared","Date of the Event":"03/26/2010 08:35 UTC","Case Number":"22518","Log Number":"US-03272010-0007"}
