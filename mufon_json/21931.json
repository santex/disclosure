(you know when planes leave a trail in the sky well that had stopped right where the \"cloud\" was) i blinked and the \"cloud\" was gone!! i thought it was me being silly, but i saw my friend in the pub later and said to her i saw some think very strange in the sky this afternoon and she asked me if i saw the plane disappear!!i tryed looking for the plane but could not see it,it made me wonder if i was going crazy but i wasnt scared, but i think i should be! now that's very freaky as i didn't tell her where i was or what i saw she told me what she saw and it was the same thing i saw!! what i want to know is how a plane can just disappear?!! there was no think on the news about it or about any plane crashing or any think!! if that wasn't an alien i saw then what was it and what's really going on?? how can a plane disappear and no one report it mising??"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.659036,+-5.035989(21931)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21931) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"21931","Date Submitted":"02/18/2010 08:14 UTC","Longitude":"-5.035989","Summary":"small object with a cloud around it made a plane disappear","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Almanza","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Date of the Event":"07/16/2005 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Region":"Castille and Leon","Latitude":"42.659036","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21931.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21931.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
