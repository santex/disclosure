{"Region":"New York","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from work and in the sky ahead I saw a round, white object moving at a fairly good clip across the sky from west to east. I tried to grab my camera but it was already gone by the time I got it out of my purse. I saw a passenger jet pass by about a minute later, and the object was at the same altitude as the jet which had just taken off from a nearby airport. The object's diameter was the same length as that of the passenger jet. There is no chance of this being a jet, however, as it was perfectly round. It also moved quite fast across the sky. I remember thinking to myself \"they're back'. I had had an experience in October of last year. I wasn't alarmed or scared - it just seemed like it was back and that it was perfectly normal for it to be in the sky near my house."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28873.html"],"Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04302011-0010","Date of the Event":"04/21/2011 05:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-73.407039","Summary":"Round object moved across sky west to east, large as a passenger jet","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.859322,+-73.407039(28873)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28873) map </A>","Case Number":"28873","City":"Huntington Station","Date Submitted":"04/30/2011 04:26 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Huntington Station","There were no other sightings in Huntington Station on or around April 21st 2011"],"Latitude":"40.859322","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
