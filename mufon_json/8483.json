I was close to 29th and Wayne walking west. I saw the object fly above me about 50 feet up or less. the trajectory was arched downward. It flew in lower and disappeared behind the trees of shunga park (a large wooded park in topeka that I was walking beside)and seemed to land based upon the trajectory. It was flying in a northernly direction. It appeared to be approximately the length of a ford 350. It was faintly illuminated in the center with a light that appeared to come from within and permiate it's casing. More eye-shaped than oval. appeared to be slightly wider than it was tall. The prow and aft were not illuminated, nor were to port and starboard edges. just the center. It seemed that the light was diffused by the casing. it was a faint white light."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Summary":"oval object that was illuminated with a faint light from within (front and back extended ends less illuminated.)","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.055824,+-95.689018(8483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8483) map </A>","Region":"Kansas","Longitude":"-95.689018","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"8483","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8483.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/24/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","Date of the Event":"11/24/2007 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","City":"Topeka","Object Features":"None, Unknown","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Topeka","There were no other sightings in Topeka on or around November 24th 2007"]}
