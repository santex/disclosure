While looking up in the sky I noticed 2 bright spherical objects that were orange white in color appear out of the south. The 2 objects were traveling on a south to north direction my guess is they were around 10,000 feet or so in altitude and had the same brightness as Jupiter. I went inside and had my wife and son come outside and they witnessed the same objects. I had witnessed this same phenomenon last week at 5 am while viewing Venus in the morning except there was only 1 and it was heading west to east and was brighter than Venus."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19200.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19200.html"]}
