My eye caught an object through the treeline across the street. We live about 6 miles SW of Flying Cloud Airport so I figured it was a small plane. As it broke the treeline I noticed it was orange in color, couldn't really make out a shape but about the size of a small plane at 500ft or so but there were no red or green or flashing navigation lights, just an orange glow, it was traveling in a West to East direction. Didn't hear any sound other than nightime crickets, it continued on a straight path about the speed a small plane would make just after takeoff. As it was further away it dimmed about 50% then returned to original brightness. It did this about three times then it dimmed out completely and I lost sight of it. No clouds in sky, very clear night. Thought it was kind of a strange."],"Date Submitted":"06/17/2012 09:50 UTC","Latitude":"44.788934","Case Number":"39409","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06172012-0012","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39409.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39409.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Savage","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Savage","There were no other sightings in Savage on or around June 16th 2012"]}
