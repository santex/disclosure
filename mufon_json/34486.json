I viewed a bright orange light ,approximatley 2500 ft above the ground,moving in a straight line accross the sky from the north toward me(south). It appeared to be moving slower than an airplane. Then seemed to appear to gain altitiude and become smaller as it got closer to my house. There was no noise.I called my room mates out to view it.They also saw it. It continued to move southward ,decreasing in size and then it disappeared."],"City":"Cape Coral","Tags":"City"}
