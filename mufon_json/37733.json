I pointed it out to my husband who noted that the object did not have any traditional flight lighting (red or green blinking lights). The brightness of the object dimmed dramatically and continued on its path (south to north). After continuing for a few more seconds, the object turned abruptly and shot off in a perpendicular direction (east) and was no longer seen. Shortly after a plane flew over in the opposite direction of the objects original path. It seems as though the object had seen the plane, dimmed and then shot off."],"Latitude":"30.219802","Object Shape":"Oval","Summary":"Bright UFO dims before changing path and shooting off.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.219802,+-97.847118(37733)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37733) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37733.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37733.html"],"Case Number":"37733","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-97.847118","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Log Number":"US-04252012-0008"}
