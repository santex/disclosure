I noticed a teardrop shaped black UFO that appears near the sun in most of the views when moving up Mona Street. The UFO seems to change shape and also at some poiint has some \"tentacles\" emanating from one end. In one photo it appears to have 2 spotlights at the front too. It's not a helicopter as there is no discernable rotor or tail rotor. The UFO is visible on all the positions of the \"viewing man\" in Google Maps when moving it along Mona Street until the end of the street. The UFO seems to move then further away from the sun. I have no indication of when the GOOGLE photos were taken but given the position of the sun and the absence of snow - i would anticipate in the spring between 11AM and 1PM. Take a look... again search for Mona St, Oxbow, SK and position the \"viewing man\" at any position on Mona St and look up near the sun - you can't miss it - it seems to be about 300 ft in the air."],"Country":"Canada","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/30/2009 11:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Blimp, Circle, Teardrop","Date Submitted":"07/16/2010 01:23 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"24550","Latitude":"49.227223","Longitude":"-102.169517","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Check GOOGLE MAPS for Mona St, Oxbow, SK - look near the sun - teardrop shaped UFO.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24550.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24550.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Oxbow","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Oxbow","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Saskatchewan"}
