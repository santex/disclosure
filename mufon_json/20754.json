We watched them for about a minute. They were much brighter than a star, more like the front lights of an airliner taking off, and one was following the other - about a hand span at arms length. As they passed over us to the west the lights stayed bright, so they were not 'headlights', but glowing objects. As they traveled southward towards the moon they started going up and disappeared in about 5 seconds. There was no sound, and it's nothing but quiet here, and you can hear if it is an aircraft passing overhead. Just silence. Their speed seemed to vary a little, almost like the effect of a large cord between them springing back and forth a bit, and was about two to three times the usual speed of a jet."],"Log Number":"US-11272009-0004","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO"}
