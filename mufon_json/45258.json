I initially thought it was a \"satellite\"(constant rate of speed, looks like a star, moving in a straight line across the sky). After about 8-10 seconds the object immediately changed direction heading south. A second or two later the object's light intensity increased by 10 to 20 times brighter, what I can only explain as a \"burst\". This \"burst\" continued every 2 seconds or so until it traveled past the roof line of my house and out of view. I thought about it all day and decided to file a report."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-01172013-0001","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
