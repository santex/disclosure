{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were stargazing from our front patio when we noticed an extremely bright flashing light in the sky - it even reflected on the Sechelt inlet above the Caren Mountain Range - southwest of our position for about 5-8 minutes. It was much brighter than any star, airplane light or even the space station. We thought it was an airplane landing light at first, but ut was steady and not moving at all. It was totally silent. There were no airplanes in the sky at the time. We felt it was unusual and we gazed at it just trying to figure out what type of light it was. It flashds 5-6 times stopped and repeated this pattern 3 times. Then it was gone. It did not move up or down while it was flashing - it was in a fixed spot above the horizon."],"Summary":"A very bright repetitive pattern flash above the Caren Mountain Range - hovering at a fixed altitude - then disappeared.","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Sechelt","There were no other sightings in Sechelt on or around May 30th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"05/30/2009 11:50 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/30/2009 11:50 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"CA-06042009-0017","City":"Sechelt","Region":"British Columbia","Latitude":"49.479293","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.479293,+-123.742358(17340)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17340) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Flash","Case Number":"17340","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-123.742358","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17340.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17340.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
