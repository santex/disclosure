{"Case Number":"9030","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I remember to this day when we saw something inexplicable in the sky on a summer evening in '75 or '76. We saw a glowing-orange perfectly-shaped orb, which was larger than a full moon, arc near the horizon rise above the tree tops and homes and travel across the evening sky from the south east to the west, not slowly, not quickly, but at a steady rate for about 20 seconds. I was in awe and was full of wonderment rather than fear, I tried to rationalize what it was. I ran inside the house to get my parents. As I did, my friend said there was a second one in the sky. By the time my parents came out, the orbs were gone. I could discern that this was not a weather balloon, plane, blimp, weather phenomena, etc. We did not call the police to report it as we were afraid we wouldn't be taken seriously. We thought we would see something in the news, as I lived near town and thought others had to have seen this, but no mention was ever made."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-86.7175","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9030.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9030.html"],"trends":["There have been 32 other sightings in La Porte","There were no other sightings in La Porte on or around June 30th 1976"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/30/1976 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.609167,+-86.7175(9030)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9030) map </A>","City":"La Porte","Log Number":"US-01182008-0038","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/30/1976 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.609167","Tags":"City","Summary":"Silent, glowing orange orb, steady pace across night sky for about 20 seconds","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana"}
