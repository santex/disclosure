I was playing football with my brother and 2 other friends. I was getting ready to throw the football and right there in front of me was a (UFO) about 60 feet off the ground and about 75 feet away. All four of us saw the Object for about 30 seconds. It was moving north to south at a slow rate of speed. It was Gray, rectangle, box shape with several colored lights around the top of the object. No windows or doors and it made No Sound. It was about the size of a large Armored Vehicle or small school bus. I have never seen it before or since.
