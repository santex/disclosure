I stood still for a moment concentrating of where in the sky to aim my camera , as I couldn't see the spaceships . I took 3 photos in total . The 1st one that I've aimed in the ES direction only showed couple of tiny white dots on the iphoto screen . The 2nd photo once loaded it basically looked at first as a gray page, this photo was taken in the WE direction, & once I begun zooming in by approx. 1 cm x 2cm squeres , than the white orbs begun to be seen. These 2 photos I've pushed the zoom to 8x the maximum my camera allows , so the Light orbs are a bit fuzzy . The 3rd photo was aimed at the direct W where the sun just went below the horizon level & the colorful bands can be seen (sun sets at this time of yr just to the left of the highrise building in the photo). Again I've zoomed this particular image on the iphoto (the camera too was at about 5x zoom), & there were some white ufo orbs , some appeared further back , others obviously were closer as they are a bit bigger & there were also 4 black stealth type jets high up in the sky . There are also dark scratch like lines & dots those are the airplanes as the airport is to the right of the sun setting . But the most buffling thing in that picture is an \"object\" about halfway right side which I cannot determine of what it could be , & that's why I'm attaching it with this report . MUFON's experts can better manipulate the zoom perhaps on Photoshop as I haven't learned yet of how to use this application . btw , the first image I contrasted a bit so the white Lights would be more visible , due to the hight elevation they're very small indeed . Also , yesterday at about 9 pm & over the lake , but higher then the incoming 2 jets were 6-7 flushes in the sky , those were in the just past mid point between E to S . Few hours later a helicopter was making rounds . That is the reason I wait few hrs to report these sightings & sometimes I don't ."]}
