I noticed Orion's belt in the eastern sky. It was a clear morning, No clouds. Then from the left, I saw a light come from behind the trees. A very bright light, twice as large as any star in the sky. It was a little left of Orion's belt It was moving sort of slow. No blinking lights, no sound. Then it blinked or pulsated 3 or 4 times then just vanished. I watched to see if it would reappear but nothing. I watched for a few minuets then I took the dog in and wrote the time down so I wouldn't forget."],"Source":"MUFON"}
