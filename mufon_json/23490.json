(it was not storming, although it was partly cloudy). it was not possible that these were lasers because the canyon itself below is not very heavily populated and all of the neighbors' lights were out - as if everyone was in bed as it was after midnight. overall, it was a very strange and mysterious occurrence. the lights stopped as abruptly as they started. did anyone else see these lights?!"],"Case Number":"23490","Country":"United States","Summary":"Mysterious white orbs over Hollywood Hills/Caheunga pass canyon","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","City":"Los Angeles","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/27/2010 01:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05272010-0012","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City"}
