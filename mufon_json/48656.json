{"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 09:15 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out on my lanai watching fireworks with my husband when we noticed a red-orange object flying. It out shined the fire works. At first we thought it was a space station, but I've seen them before and they were never that big or that color. The way it flew or floated resembled the flight path of one. It flew over us and continued on till we could no longer see it. We commented that it was going to fast for a plane, ha ha must be a UFO. Meanwhile we were mesmerized by it and found ourselves ignoring the fireworks and staring at this orange thing flying. Five minutes later, it did the exact same thing. Now we know somethings \"off\", as nothing I know of can go around the earth that fast. No it did not just circle around like a helicopter, it flew horizon to horizon. It flew SE-NW. Didn't sleep well."],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 08:29 UTC","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Sebastian","There were no other sightings in Sebastian on or around July 4th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-07052013-0031","Summary":"Orange reddish glow moving across the sky, 2 times.","Region":"Florida","Case Number":"48656","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Sebastian","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.796878,+-80.489933(48656)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48656) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.796878","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48656.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48656.html"],"Longitude":"-80.489933"}
