I was driving back to California from Chicago on I80 listening to the music when I notice two huge circle lights they looked like light that you put behind a white screen for taking photos well I notice them at the corner of my eye and I was looking at them thinking it was an airplane, but then the object began to turn around, as it was turning around I notice a bright red light on the top of the object flashing. And small little lights on the back. this object was huge I though well it might be an air plane because of the large flashing red light but as I keep looking at it the object was hovering it was going way two slow to be an airplane I would say 10 or 20 mph. I notice the outline of the object when the red light would flash. It was shape like a triangle. The object had turn around like an airplane but was heading north at 10 or 20mph that���s when I called my girlfriend a told her what I was seeing. I didn���t have a cam phone on me. I had the net10 phone from walmart so I couldn���t take a picture because it doesn���t have a cam in it. So I decided to draw what I saw before I forget. You can download it."],"Log Number":"US-11102008-0022","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13647.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13647_submitter_file1__1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13647.html"],"Region":"Nebraska"}
