I noticed this large white and multi colored orb pulsating about 45 degrees up from the treeline. I kept watching it as I drove and saw it go extreemly bright white and huge for a few seconds before it changed size to very small but still bright white then it just disapeared. I ask my husband the whole time \"what is that bright thing in the sky\". At first he thought it was a star but when it disapeared he was as surprised and puzzled as I am. There was an airplane flying from the north going south closer to us right before the orb disapeard and it was still flying after the orb disapeared. Id say the airplane was flying at 30 or 35 degrees above the treeline. It is a clear night and we can see the stars. No noise was heard."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Sidney","There were no other sightings in Sidney on or around November 3rd 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52018.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"11/03/2013 08:10 UTC","Longitude":"-84.059748"}
