I continued watching it for a few more mins the a large commercial airplane flew by and the shape still did not move. I went in to call my husband and when I came back it had vanished. I am not sure what it was and there were no news reports which there usually are although I dont belive they are related our power went out the same night to 685 customers and was out for 1 hr 15 min in my area only. To be honest it frightend me imensly as I said I called my husband and told him I thought I was loosing my mind I was very paranoid for the rest of the day untill he got home."],"Log Number":"US-04242009-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16662.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16662.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/22/2009 04:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Colorado","City":"Denver","Weather Factors":"Windy","Date of the Event":"04/22/2009 04:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Other","Case Number":"16662","Source":"MUFON"}
