It appeared to be moving from the south to the north in a straight line, east of where we were walking. The light was constant. No flashing strobe as you'd see on aircraft. It was 4 times larger than any visible stars. Clear sky, no clouds, full moon, no wind. My son also observed it. It was moving at a rate about twice what we have observed aircraft in the area previously. We watched the object for about 2 - 3 minutes and then it vanished. I can't explain what it was. There was no sound, no other aircraft I could see in the area."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"moving orange light","Region":"Nebraska","City":"Omaha","Log Number":"US-10312009-0011"}
