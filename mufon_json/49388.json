The only lights in the room that were on was a tiny red dot on my Blu-Ray player, a tiny red dot on my TV (indicating they were off), and off in the kitchen, our microwave was displaying the time. I was facing away from the window when I saw a bright green light fill the room. I looked out the window behind me, but there was no source of the light. Behind my house about 100 feet away is our town hall, and there was one white street light on, and nothing else. I proceeded to look around the room for any source of the light, and as I turned back to the window, the light disappeared. Although the incident only 60-90 seconds (I estimate about 75), when I looked back at the time, it was a good 15 minutes later than when I had just looked around the room. I suddenly felt very tired, and proceeded to fall asleep. I haven't experienced such a thing since."],"Log Number":"US-08022013-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49388.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49388.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"08/02/2013 02:06 UTC","Longitude":"-70.306417"}
