T pointed to a flashing white light in the sky and we have been watching it since. It has been moving in an undefined path but has been staying in the same general area of the sky. The flashes have been getting faster and slower off and on. It goes from 1 flash per five seconds to 3 flashes per second. It has been moving around getting faster and slower. It has been going on for going on an hour and a half and is still flashing as I type. T said she thought it was shaped like a triangle, and me and S really can't tell."],"City":"Panama City Beach","Date of the Event":"07/01/2012 01:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
