As I looked at the sun setting, I noticed only one cloud could be seen in the sky just above and to the left of the sunset. However the cloud moved at a consistent speed from west to east. In the center of the teardrop shaped cloud was a dark shape. I believe the sunset caused the cloud and shape in the center to be visible. It could have been a man made vehicle, but it definetely was under control and was definetely enclosed with a teardropped shaped cloud."],"Object Shape":"Teardrop, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.27726","Longitude":"-76.882928","Log Number":"US-02192010-0007","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date Submitted":"02/19/2010 07:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Teardrop Moving cloud with dark shape in center moving east at sunset","City":"Harrisburg","Date of the Event":"02/19/2010 05:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.27726,+-76.882928(21940)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21940) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"21940","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21940.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21940.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
