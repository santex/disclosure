{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"07/15/2006 01:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","City":"St Joseph","divs":["Sighting DetailsStanding on my deck looking up at the sky on a clear July night. I had just seen a satellite track across the sky and was commenting to my wife that I had seen it. Then a glow of light coming from the south to southeast moving north to northwest was coming over the hip our house. I said to my wife \"what is that\" and she turned and saw it too.. then it broke up into 5 objects in a somewhat V pattern but with one object not keeping formation but floating behind almost erratic. They were very high but not as high as the satellite, no sound at all, and looked very large for the altitiude they were flying in which many planes just look a speck. The objects had a large rounded front with wings that curved back and a very short tail, like a bump, and seeemingly glowing like angels. They continued to fly off over lake Michigan in a northwest direction. It semed they covered the distnce from the Indiana border to north of St. Joseph, Michigan in a matter of seconds, much faster than any normal plane I know. After the sighting I checked a book of military planes I have and not one that matched the shape. Somehow I still think these may be military just because of the formation and shape. I saw a program about stealth planes that talked about a plasma shield or barrier that would evade radar, which glows. The part that still baffles me is the speed and no sound coming from engines."],"Date of the Event":"07/15/2006 01:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"14769","Region":"Michigan","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14769.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14769.html"],"Summary":"Bright glowing gold, 5 craft in formation unusual plane like shape.","Latitude":"42.100706","Longitude":"-86.480347","Log Number":"US-01052009-0011","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.100706,+-86.480347(14769)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14769) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Wings","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in St Joseph","There were no other sightings in St Joseph on or around July 15th 2006"]}
