To my left, I noticed a distant light that first struck me as a possible shooting star, but as it moved i noticed there were about 3 lights beneath the craft and realized it wasn't a shooting star at all. it moved so quickly and disappeared almost immediately. The most interesting thing is that my husband and i witnessed another unidentifed hovering red orb that had an egg shape and would disappear and reappear. it often changed shape from an oval to a sphere to an oblong shape. This occurred only two days prior to this sighting. 2 in 1 week."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.027283,+-84.584944(28795)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28795) map </A>","City":"Crestview Hills","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28795.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28795.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"saw flying object wth lights on bottom","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.027283"}
