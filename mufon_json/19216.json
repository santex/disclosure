After looking at it for like 4 seconds, I quickly aimed at it and took a photo (I had my camera ready at the time). I KNOW FOR SURE I did not imagine it because during the whole time I was looking at it, I kept asking myself if it was real. The timestamp on the photo is 11.41 AM. My camera used is a Canon PowerShot A570. I did not retouch or doctor the photo in any way. You can see the UFO around the center of the photo, zoom in and sharpen to see it clearer. 1. I was looking for chemtrails in the sky to photograph, in the driveway at the house where I live. There were several passing planes. 2. Noticed it because it was moving. 3. When I first noticed it I didn't know what to make of it. It was glinting in the sky and sailing smoothly across the sky. It looked like it could be some kind of toy? 4. (see above) 5. Looked at it for around 4-5 seconds, and kept questioning myself if it was real (no doubt). Was going to ignore it but decided to take the photo anyway. After the event I realized that this was not a normal object to be seeing in the sky, and I realized that I might've just seen a UFO, the first time in my life, despite only hearing stories about UFOs. My pulse started racing and i went inside to check the photo on my laptop. 6. Lost sight of it after taking the photo, because I guess by that time it traveled away and I couldn't pinpoint it any more."],"Longitude":"-79.378854","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.661536,+-79.378854(19216)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19216) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/10/2009 11:41 UTC","Region":"Ontario","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Blimp","Latitude":"43.661536","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There was one other sighting in Toronto on or around September 10th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Metallic yellowish-white orb- or lemon- shaped object in the sky moving quite fast.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19216.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19216_submitter_file1__IMG_0186.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19216.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Toronto"}
