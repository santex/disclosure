{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watching vultures circling when I noticed a faint star-like object, white in color. Sighted nearly due east. I suspected a UFO since it was not moving, and no stars are observable at mid-day. Surprise at the time of the sighting. Had to leave my home. I am a veteran Navy aircrewman with several thousand hours flight time, and amatuer astromer. I notice when I see things in the sky that do not normally belong there."],"Case Number":"37174","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.041119,+-86.581293(37174)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37174) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-86.581293","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37174.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37174.html"],"Log Number":"US-04072012-0007","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"37.041119","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"04/07/2012 11:15 UTC","City":"Bowling Green","Region":"Kentucky","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Bowling Green","There were no other sightings in Bowling Green on or around April 7th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"04/07/2012 12:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"As stated below."}
