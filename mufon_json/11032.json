I yelled to my house guest who was in bed in his bedroom what I was seeing as I was rushing out for a better look at the saucer and jet. My husband in bed did not wake up when I yelled for our house guest. My houseguest who is a retired navy petty officer and I went into the back yard for a better look at the saucer and jet flying less than a mile away from us at about 3000 feet, just above Grants Pass peak. On the first loop it was one saucer and one jet, on the second loop it was one saucer and one jet. The next loop there were two saucers and two jets, after that on each loop there was another saucer and another jet. Be a total of three saucers and three military jets. Every half hour the saucers would come back as if circling a certain area in a set pattern. Ann said there was no fear, just many other emotions.��� I would have never thought I would have experienced this in my life time, it was awesome! I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I laughed when the military jet was chasing after the saucer and it got really close to it and then the saucer took off so fast that no way could the jet keep up. GOD that was funny as hell.��� The saucers with the jets chasing them were going towards Jacksonville OR, the town President Bush was in and flew back again. This continued to happen several more times with the time intervals getting shorter. The loops started out at half an hour, went down to 20 minutes, then 15 minutes and then 10 minutes. At one point we saw a fighter jet refueling in the sky. The saucers made no noise but the jets were making a lot of noise. Ann watched the craft and jets for several hours before she became too tired to watch any more. Ann went to bed and slept. It probably came back but I didn���t awake until my alarm went off to get ready for work. Sam watched them all night until first light when they flew away. Sam is a retired Navy petty officer. He had never seen any craft like the ones the jets were chasing all night. They flew faster than any plane he had ever seen. He watched the crafts and jets flying in loops all night so there was plenty of time to study the craft. He was surprised how the saucers would slow down and then speed back up as if playing cat and mouse with the jets which were going as fast as they could go. Sam thought it was cool and exciting to watch the craft and jets as they flew along their flight path."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.445407,+-123.324292(11032)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11032) map </A>","Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-123.324292","Date of the Event":"10/15/2004 11:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"42.445407"}
