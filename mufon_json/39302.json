I noticed a bright white light appear on the western horizon and tracked it steadily east until it disappeared again over horizon. WAY too bright to be a satellite, stars were not yet visible. No flashing or blinking FAA lights, no sound. I went inside & grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look - to the naked eye object appeared to be a single white light, however when viewed through binoculars object was five lights arranged in a circular pattern."],"Summary":"Flyby","City":"Mancos"}
