It was moving under the clouds during a brief sprinkle of rain. It appeared to go off and on as it traveled northward but was under the clouds far enough that they would not have blocked the view. As it traveled it flashed bright, then dim about 10 times, then just blinked out. After about 5 seconds it appeared again briefly, then went out again. The total time was 10-20 seconds. It was traveling along the shoreline of Lake Huron."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Longitude":"-85.600294","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48769.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48769.html"],"Latitude":"44.320224","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.320224,+-85.600294(48769)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48769) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/06/2013 10:30 UTC","Case Number":"48769","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07072013-0009"}
