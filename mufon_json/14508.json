We live in Tallahassee right near I-10 and my house is on one of the highest hills in the city. As i turned to look, the object vasillatted back and forth and instantly shot up to a way higher altitude. Remaining at that same altitude it sped away while zig zagging at the same time. The rate of speed and the abrupt change in speed and direction was extraordinary.It had only one light that would dim to yellow. The light just became a pin point of light as it sped away We both pretty much knew what we were looking at! We are both lucid and wide awake. Wow. That kind of technology wont be around for some time to come and it is srtiking when you finally see it."],"Date Submitted":"12/23/2008 07:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Tallahassee","There were no other sightings in Tallahassee on or around December 23rd 2008"],"Log Number":"US-12232008-0012","Case Number":"14508","City":"Tallahassee","Summary":"Strange light moves quickly away to higher altitude then zig zags at ridiculous speeds.","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"12/23/2008 07:15 UTC","Country":"United States"}
