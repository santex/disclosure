(i was at work and had just gone on my break) he asked me to look outside and in the area of the sun and tell him what i could see. he stated that he and his wife were in indy on medical business and that another person seeing these things was in lafayette. i went outside and at first glance didn't seen anything except some cotton wood flying, some bugs and a few flying spider webs, all flying with the air current and looking quite pretty in the bright sun and clear blue sky. then suddenly i happened to notice something quite different. the object i saw moved out from the corona of the sun was clearly a much higher altitude than the bugs and other debris flying around. this object was moving against the air current that was propelling the other debris in the air. it stopped. held steady it's position for well over one minute (which is like a century when you are watching, btw) and then proceeded to move back into the sun, where i was no longer able to see it. it was quite large. with that, there appeared a whole host of other odd moving \"things��� at one point there were so many that it gave the sun the appearance of an atom with all the molecules circling about it. it was that kind of movement and it was simply spectacular to watch. i���m my 51 years, i have enver seen anything like it. i had to go back in to work at 11:30 am and it was still going strong. i want back outside again at 1 pm and it was still going on. by 1:45 pm it seemed to be waning. a number of other employees wandered outside and watched the show, as well. i would estimate that at least 15 people that i know of went outside and observed the strange lights. like i said, i did see a lot of cotton wood flying about. as well as bugs and, to my surprise, quite a lot of spider web material. i have read about the high air spider webs before but never seen them until today. they were very pretty to watch. but not anomalous in nature"],"City":"Kokomo","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24057.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24057_submitter_file2__sun-orb.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24057_submitter_file3__sun-orb2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24057.html"],"Summary":"Multiple orbs circling the sun.","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.128323","trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in Kokomo","There were no other sightings in Kokomo on or around June 30th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"24057","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Date of the Event":"06/30/2009 11:07 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.488637,+-86.128323(24057)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24057) map </A>","Log Number":"US-06302010-0024","Latitude":"40.488637"}
