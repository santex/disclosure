It was only thundering and lightening from a distance in front of us but not at our house yet. Then I was about to head inside and my boyfriend said \"hey come look at this quick\" and when I stuck my head off the porch and looked up all the way to my left I saw some odd object moving. It was dark and circular spinning and moving in a fast straight line over our building in our vision until about 8 seconds later when it was all the way to my right side and disappeared. It was below the clouds then towards the end went into them. I have never seen anything like this. It was so fast I wish I had my phone to take a video it was incredible. It was fast and the lights were crazy like nothing I have ever seen before."],"Log Number":"US-06122012-0019","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/12/2012 09:00 UTC","Summary":"Waiting for storm to start noticed a object with about 4 lights flashing in wierd pattern spinning moving in the sky.","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"Fort Myers","Date Submitted":"06/12/2012 09:18 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39308.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39308.html"],"Latitude":"26.645928","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Case Number":"39308","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-81.866798","Sighting Duration":"00:00:08","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Fort Myers","There was one other sighting in Fort Myers on or around June 12th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
