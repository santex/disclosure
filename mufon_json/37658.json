I know, because I had just used my app on the phone and saw Mars. and the light came from the same direction. The light came from the same angle on my right moving fast and across to the left towards me and getting bigger till stopping in front of me. At this time, it's size was as big as a moon. It was now a clearly visible bright thick ring with another ring of equal thickness and brightness inside. Edges where not dull. It stopped for about 5 seconds. Then slowly moved left getting smaller as it got higher in the sky till it dissapeared. I saw a fisherman that was about 20 feet from me on the ocean. He confirmed seeing the same thing. We have no pictures."]}
