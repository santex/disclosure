Online I have been watching videos on mars and the moon, and they say as of right now there is life on mars and the moon. They have found little out post on the darkside of the moon and nasa has seen a smoke stack come out of the ground and release smoke up in the atmosphere, they say the stack releaseing the smoke had to be at least 700 feet in the air and also they say there are cooling tower on the dark side of the moon.
