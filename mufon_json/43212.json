The light came from the SW and headed in a straight line to the NW. Like everyone, we just thought it was a VERY bright light from a plane when it was at a distance. What caught our attention was how bright the light was and it didn't seem to change. It was flying too slow for a plane and too fast for a bright satellite. It had no blinking lights, solid white light, no sound, same light intentsity regardless of the direction, steady slow speed, and it was larger compared to ??? We took cell phone video but it's just a white light in the night sky - not very awe inspiring. We have bon fires virtually every weekend and sometimes multiple times. we are not novice to the night sky. This was very interesting and to be remembered."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.79077,+-88.779968(43212)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43212) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43212.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43212.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States"}
