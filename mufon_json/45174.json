We had a large snow fall a day ago and so I was helping clear the ice on the sidewalk. I was just about to smash the ice when a bright reflection in the ice caught my eye. I looked up and a triangular shaped aircraft flew overhead at an amazing speed. The aircraft was a geometric triangle without any identifiable features other than its reflection. It had a straight path as if it had direction. I asked my cousin if he saw it after it flown by, but he saw nothing. I searched the horizon to prove it to him but it was quick. I felt a noticeable temperature drop after this incident even though it was already -11C."],"City":"Calgary","Latitude":"51.048275","Country":"Canada","Date Submitted":"01/13/2013 12:40 UTC","Summary":"Fast Aircraft","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Case Number":"45174","Longitude":"-114.050991","trends":["There have been 76 other sightings in Calgary","There were no other sightings in Calgary on or around January 11th 2013"],"Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.048275,+-114.050991(45174)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45174) map </A>"}
