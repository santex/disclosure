I was about 16 years old. New street lights had not been installed so one could see the sky clearly. As I sat on steps I saw what looked like a \"star-like\" object moving across the sky from beyond the homes on the other side of the street. It was moving at a constant speed not like a shooting star. It must have been traveling fast because it was very high in the sky. As it went out of my view as my house was in the way. I ran through the house to the backyard. As I reached the yard the \"star-like\" object appeared as it was traveling in a straight line. Then suddenly it made a sharp right angle toward the west. It went a short distance from my point of view it made another sharp right angle going in the direction it came from. I ran back through the house to the front steps and once again I saw the \"star-like\" object until it disappeared beyond the houses on the other side if the street. I probably could somewhat pinpoint the date because once the new street lights were installed it became difficult to see the sky as clearly as ,before they were installed. This has stayed with me all my life and I just want someone to know about it. The sharp turns this object made were not curved at all, just sharp turns."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42695.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42695.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Huntingdon","There were no other sightings in Huntingdon on or around August 10th 1955"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-09212012-0008","Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"42695","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"40.505231","Date Submitted":"09/21/2012 12:22 UTC"}
