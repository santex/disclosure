I looked up and saw a triangle shaped object with white lights around exterior of triangle shaped object. It hovered for approximately 10 minutes then shot to the right very fast and then left very fast without even rising up in the air. I noticed it because of the size, and how close it was to the ground. We pulled to the side of the rosd and observed it hovering, and then flying off. It was very suprising about how low it was and how it manuvered then how fast it flew off."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46174.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46174.html"],"Summary":"We were stopped on hwy 280 I looked up and it was hovering in air i watched it for approximately 10 mins and then it went to the right and flew off fast"}
