As I approched my car I looked up to see a light in the sky, at first I thought it may be a star. As i watched the light I ruled out that it was a star because the light was below the cloud cover. (The clouds were low approx. 3000 to 5000 feet.) As I watched the light it started to move, slowly at first left to right, right to left. Soon the light was making circles not perfect circles but eratic ones. I continues to watch the light for Approx. 1 minute 30 seconds then the light slowly accended into the clouds and I lost sight of it."],"Log Number":"US-08292009-0020","City":"St John","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/28/2009 08:20 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Latitude":"41.454263"}
