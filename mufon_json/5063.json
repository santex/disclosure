I have been seeing pulsating objects for 8 weeks now so setup the camcorder on a tripod and pressed the record button. The Objects range from an Orange to almost yellow color and compaired to a dim lightbulb. I am using a SONY DCR-DVD 105 Handycam with Super Nightshot Plus with infrared light. I didn���t see the this object with the naked eye but did see the pulsating UFO 14 mins later and also have that on DVD. After viewing the DVD I discovered this footage and here's my opinion. I think its a probe checking out the infrared light source and after in comes into the camera view and changes direction a couple of time up to the right there seems to be a tiny lightning looking bolt coming from an object in the sky. I think this is either a guide for the probe or a tractor beam for the probe or may actually be the UFO itself. I may be wrong on my analysis but who knows at this point. It���s clearly not a bug or insect and the fact that I saw the UFO just 14 mins later tells me it had something to do with it. I'm including an MPG format Video so you can see it more clearly."],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"Delray Beach","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07122006-0005","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/11/2006 09:16 UTC","Summary":"Possible Probe and Orange Pulsating UFO Video"}
