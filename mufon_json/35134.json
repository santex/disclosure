I heard a helicopter from UC Davis Medcenter start up for take off. About that same time, I looked up and noticed an object with blurry lights pass over the house. I thought it was a lear jet, but it was followed by no sound. It was if the boomerang shaped object appeared as if transparent out of the sky, flew over a tree in our backyard and it shot off into space and disappeared. Normally, on such a clear and quiet night, I would hear sounds of some kind, airplanes, etc., but on this night, the ship disappeared without a single sound. After the experience, I went into the house to tell my husband. I wasn't afraid, but fascinated that after all these years of looking into the sky at the stars, I had never seen anything like this. I have to say I was very pleased that it didn't stop and pick me up...:o)"],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Wings","Latitude":"38.542992","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35134.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35134.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around January 23rd 2012"],"Case Number":"35134","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"California","Longitude":"-121.461379","Date of the Event":"01/23/2012 09:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Boomerang","City":"Sacramento","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/25/2012 02:44 UTC"}
