It was clear and sunny. My sister saw this object coming from the East above the interstate route 190 and drew it to my attention. It was about 6 blocks away and at first I thought it was a jet until I realized it made no noise. My sister and I started run home because we were frightened. It followed us gliding along the tree tops and then veered off towards the Grand Island bridge Southeast. It was a silver color."],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Latitude":"43.098944"}
