Then, one after another, they blinked out disappearing, only to blink back and reappear again one at a time in order. I later learned that a hot air balloon festival is occurring this weekend, starting the day of my sighting, in Middletown, OH, approximately 10 miles away. I don't believe hot air balloons are what I witnessed due to the fact that event was already over. That said, I'm still not sure what I witnessed, and for all I know, despite having doubts, it very well could have been lights from the balloon festival. i also see im not the only one who witnessed this event in the sky."],"Date of the Event":"07/17/2010 10:00 UTC","Summary":"Four amber lights in the sky.","Log Number":"US-07182010-0011","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24619.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24619.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Ohio","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.408631","Date Submitted":"07/18/2010 12:13 UTC","City":"Hamilton","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Longitude":"-84.554136","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.408631,+-84.554136(24619)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24619) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON"}
