I opened the mini blinds and got out the binoculars. We live on the beach in Ventura and there are no street lights to block out the stars over the ocean and our back yard, we have a clear shot. With the binos you could clearly see the craft blinking lights of several different colors, red, blue, green and white. While the white lights were on you could just make out the shape of the craft. Living here in Ventura we have seen missels shot off and the space shuttle come in, this was nothing like I have ever seen before. I hope it comes back to night. The craft hung there in the South West sky for about an hour moving West and then just as it was there, it was gone. My feelings were excitement and thrill. Sorry no photos were taken, we don't have a camara that would capture that awsome site."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01252010-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21637.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21637.html"],"City":"Oxnard","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/25/2010 03:03 UTC","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Oxnard","There were no other sightings in Oxnard on or around January 25th 2010"]}
