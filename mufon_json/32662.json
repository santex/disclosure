At the time, there were no airplanes nor helicopters in the sky. Then, after 30seconds the object separated into two, as the other object sat still in the sky with no movement or no sound of an engine. As the other object separated, it glided across the sky to the westward direction of the street remaining still for about 60 seconds. I noticed a white shadow up under the bottom of the object. Then the object started ascending straight upward into the sky until it disappeared. I glanced back across the sky noticing the other round object remained in the sky. Before daybreak, the object vanished."],"Longitude":"-74.232015","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON"}
