I emediatly spotted a metallic cigar shaped object hanging vertically in the sky.I had no idea what it was. At that time it did not appear to be moving much. I then went into the house to get the camera. I returned seconds later and snapped three shots then proceeded to take a 3 min. 18 sec. video of the object. During this time it became appairent the object was moving but at a slow rate.The obeject, at times, appeared as if it were going to flip to a horizontal possion but never acheived it. I guess the best way to discribe it is \"swinging like a pendelem on a clock.\" On the video you hear me state the winds were out of the west, however they were actually out of the south west. after taking the video I had speculated the object had something to do with the wal-mart convention taking place in Fayetteville that day, however we live about 25 miles south of where that convention was taking place. We walked to the yard still taking pictures and watching it move slowly to the east until we could not see it anymore. I've tried to reationalize, and even debunk what we saw that day, but with no sucsess. None of the universities in the area knew of any weather expiriments takeing place that day, nor did the local tv stations"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-10292008-0008","Longitude":"-94.148876","Date of the Event":"06/04/2008 07:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13347.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13347_submitter_file1__4315.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13347_submitter_file3__4321.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13347.html"],"Summary":"Object appaired in north sky and was first seen by my wife.
