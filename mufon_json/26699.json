One moved a few feet then dissappeared. The other remained for a few seconds then dissappeared momentarily then reappeared about 40 yds. way and floated motionlessly near a utility pole. It then started moving west at about ten miles per hour at about thirty feet high and about 50 ft. from me. It continued to move west with no sound for about 40 yds then disappeared behind trees. I was excited for a few seconds but then felt very calm as if nothing had happened. It was not a bright light, but rather a glow with no spikes of light around it nor any auras or halo."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-85.593114","Log Number":"US-11222010-0004","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"07/22/2007 11:00 UTC","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Summary":"Small white sphere appeared in east then slowly traveled west at about 30 feet high and about fifty feet away.
