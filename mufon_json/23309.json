As I prepared to video the object with my phone, the object slowed and came to a halt. From the time it started to slow to the time it stopped took 4 to 5 seconds. Once it had stopped it quickly (1 sec) faded from view. The object was about the size and luminosity of Jupiter when you can just make out it's four major moons. Perhaps slightly larger. Upon reviewing the video I could find nothing. The entire sighting lasted about 20 seconds. I searched the internet for satellite information to see if there were any corresponding flyovers for that time but the only one's I could find were well East of my position. The object I saw tracked North to South flying and stopping directly overhead before disappearing. I live in the suburb of Embleton, Perth W.Aust."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"Australia","Latitude":"-31.950264","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-31.950264,+115.859709(23309)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23309) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/15/2010 07:00 UTC","Region":"Western Australia","City":"Perth","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23309.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23309.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/16/2010 02:28 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
