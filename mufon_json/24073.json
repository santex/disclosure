{"Log Number":"BG-07012010-0010","divs":["Sighting DetailsAround midnight on July 1st 2010 I was looking at the sky, which was cloudless, when I spotted an object far from the horizon, which resembled a star, but was moving relatively fast. It looked like it was high in the atmosphere. The sight lasted for a few seconds, when the object just disappeared. I stress again that there wasn't a single cloud in the sky, so the UFO couldn't have went behind one."],"Date of the Event":"07/01/2010 01:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Plovdiv","Country":"Bulgaria","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"07/01/2010 05:31 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"A star-like object moving fast high in the atmosphere.","Case Number":"24073","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Plovdiv","There were no other sightings in Plovdiv on or around July 1st 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24073.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24073.html"],"Region":"Plovdiv","Latitude":"42.148291","Longitude":"24.752122","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.148291,+24.752122(24073)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24073) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
