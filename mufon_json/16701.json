After spending an enjoyable evening with friends at St. Armands Circle in Sarasota, Florida, I got home around 9:30 p.m. I wish to declare that I did NOT consume any alcohol beverage at any time during the night. I want to get that out of the way, so doubters cannot use that excuse as an influential substance to enhance what was about to happen next. I watched TV for a half an hour, and then decided to go to bed. While shutting things down in my condo, I walked over to the slider that leads onto my lanai, when a very bright strobing light caught my eye and I stood there mesmerized. I went out onto the lanai to get a better glimpse of this amazing sight and noticed the colors of the strobes, which were blinking white, blue, green and red, extremely fast. I���d seen this strange phenomenon many times before, but never could determine what it was, but this was different, as it was so intense. Back to last night���s sighting, I immediately put on my ���healthy skeptic���s hat��� and watched closely to see if there was any movement to this object. I also tried to discern if it was a conventional aircraft or other logical airborne vehicle, as they can appear to not move if they���re headed toward or away from you. There was no indication of movement in any direction. I then ran to get my binoculars and focused them on this strange strobing light of many colors. Again, no movement. It was quite large in size and appeared to be elongated and somewhat flat from the angle I observed it from. More and more, I began to believe I was viewing a UFO. I ran to get my portable phone and called a friend in my condo complex to calmly tell her what I was seeing. All of a sudden, during my conversation with my friend, it blacked out and was gone! I thought it might be due to cloud cover, but I am not sure. I do wish to state that just prior to this ���black out��� I did witness some slight movement to the south before it disappeared entirely. I stayed up until 1:05 a.m. to keep watch, but the object never returned to this position, at least. I have seen these colored strobing lights before in the night sky when I lived in Arizona and performed an experiment. As the Earth turns, any visible stars or constellations will change position in time, but not these lights. They remain fixed in their position ALWAYS. So, there you have it. While it may not be classified as an Unidentified Flying Object, I will state that it IS an Unidentified Stationary Object. Another twist to the USO controversy."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.956385","Date of the Event":"04/24/2009 10:00 UTC","Longitude":"-82.449048","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Tampa","Date Submitted":"04/24/2009 10:00 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.956385,+-82.449048(16701)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16701) map </A>"}
