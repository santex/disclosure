{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from my boyfriend's house and the sky was a pretty pink color and it was close to sunset and so I took out my cellphone and took a picture of the horizon. Later as I looked at the picture, I realized there was an object in the upper right corner that I did not notice when I took the picture and so I zoomed the object in and could not come to any explanation as to what it might be."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Piney Flatts","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Tennessee","Date of the Event":"12/02/2010 06:00 UTC","Summary":"Unexplained object captured in sunset","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29813_submitter_file1__156964_180046678678449_100000193546126_648268_2032439_n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29813_submitter_file2__154303_180046418678475_100000193546126_648266_1210471_n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29813.html"],"Longitude":"-82.298764","Log Number":"US-06302011-0022","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.427362,+-82.298764(29813)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29813) map </A>","Case Number":"29813","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/30/2011 09:42 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.427362","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","City":"Piney Flatts","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
