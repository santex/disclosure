As I stood on my sidewalk I noticed a light patch in the clouds in the east-northeast sky. It was overcast and no stars or the moon were visible. My first thought was that it was a star shining through a thin patch of clouds but then I quickly noticed it was rotating clockwise in a rather tight circle. One rotation took approximately 5-6 seconds. The object or light was about tree top height. It seemed to be over my driveway. There was no noticeable \"beam\" to discern if it was shining from above or below the clouds. I watched it for a few minutes outside but got spooked and cold so went inside. I watched it from a window and it continued to rotate in an even circle at an even pace. It never went higher or lower. I watched it for about 10 more minutes until it just vanished. The time that it vanished was 5:52am. I am very curious to find out what this was - as I am sure everyone who sees something odd is. My first feeling was that it was from a searchlight but we are somewhat rural and the circle was so small and compact that does not seem possible."],"Summary":"Rotating light at tree top height.","City":"North Mankato","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/08/2009 05:35 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"US-03082009-0013","Longitude":"-94.033845","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.1733,+-94.033845(15921)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15921) map </A>","Case Number":"15921","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval","Region":"Minnesota","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/08/2009 05:35 UTC"}
