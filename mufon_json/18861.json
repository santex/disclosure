I went to see the property outside Yelm Wa. near McKenna's border. The first shot I took caught me off guard as it looked like a brief look at a leif or bird flying by. When I looked up I only saw sky but the camera saw it. The camera is new andI bought it from Fred Meyer a week before- Sony Digital. Thinking that was just a bird or leif I went into the Mobil that was trashed out and the camera shot even more things. That afternoon I took friends over to the place after showing them the pictures and shot pictures of a bunch of funny round bubble lights that only showed on the camera. Our hair on our arms stood on end like static electricity. Then to make sure that I didnt have a broken camera, I took shots at home and at the neighbors. The neighbor is a Thrston County Sherrif who said he too had those bubbles show up on his camera when he checked into buying the same place. Needless to say I am not buying that place as too many friends as well as myself were creeped out by all this. If it was a UFO why dont they just make themselves known instead of being so secretive? You would think that with all that technology they would feel a bit safer but No, They just zip in and out.
