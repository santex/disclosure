Speed approx 30-35 mph. Visibility clear, slight over cast but none during sighting. Car windows are tinted but rolled down window, observing while at stop light. What got my attention was its color, decent (slow), the fact that there was two of them mirroring each other up until once started circling the other. Before the other circled its partner in a slow manner, the gap between the two fluctuated. Gradually increasing and decreasing at a relatively slow speed. I don't know what to make of it but relate it to the solar flare event that took place last week? I worked in aviation for 6 years and have a degree in the field. so I know of the kind of lights, colors, and or sounds were applicable."],"Region":"","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"anybody but me see those two orange lights above guam (dededo) circling for a good 7 minutes then disappear?
