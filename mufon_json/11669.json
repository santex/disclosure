It looked like a commercial jet until it rotated showing its shape to be a circular disk. It shifted and vanished","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home on Mo-Pac fwy heading South towards Austin and I saw a thin silver shape. It was small and looked to be quite a long distant away. In my sight it looked to be about an inch long so it's hard to tell really how big it was. It matched the appearance of a plane landing or taking off from Bergstrom Intl Airport. It then rotated and showed its shape to be a solid circular disk. It shifted slightly and vanished. The only other person in my vehicle was my 5 year-old daughter and she didnt see it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-07222008-0002","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There were no other sightings in Austin on or around July 21st 2008"],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.275473,+-97.741281(11669)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11669) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11669.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11669.html"],"Tags":"City"}
