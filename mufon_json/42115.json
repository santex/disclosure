Normally there are helicopters in the area but this light did not move and seemed to glow brightly. I went to the window and saw it hovering in the distance. I grabbed my camera, ran to the terrace and started taking pics. The object had three points (imagine like three balls fused together) erratic movements, going up and down, suddenly went really high and started to shimmer and there seemed to be some light coming out from its side (picture a comet, but orange). Suddenly, it transformed from what you (sort of) see in the photos into an elongated DNA helix type shape, with millions of pinprick lights. It moved back and forth turning on itself, it seemed, and suddenly disappeared behind my building. I lost sight of it then."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Los Angeles","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"42115","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/27/2012 10:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/28/2012 07:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42115.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42115.html"]}
