I saw a plane flying alot lower in the southern sky. I looked east at watched as the red light stopped in mid-air at a white point. The red and white flashed or pulsated and it seemed like the white light went in and out of the red light. I got the Ipad to see what constellations were in the sky. The report said it was where Betelgeuse is. This would make sense except I know I saw the red light travel horizonatally across the sky and stop."],"Region":"Missouri","Latitude":"37.217507","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01222012-0014","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-93.290999","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.217507,+-93.290999(35059)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35059) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"saw this light go across the sky and stop at a white point of light.","Date Submitted":"01/22/2012 08:03 UTC","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Springfield","There were no other sightings in Springfield on or around January 22nd 2012"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"35059"}
