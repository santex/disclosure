it seems that there may be interested in the current ufo story in stephenville, texas on jan. 8th and our sightings in eugene in 1981 -'82 along with the fact that we are currently building a prototype of the same laser propulsion system we were awarded international and us patents on. you did a story on mr. miller and i in 1989 when we were negotiatinfg with boeing aerospace & electronics also. seems like this would be of extreme public interest... please contact me (503.780.2011) or michael miller (541.925.3001) if you like we would come in for an interview (again). at any rate we are making progress and the same ufos are still at it! i have attached a copy of the cover of our forthcoming book \"debris\" and a copy of the register-guard newspaper article from 1982 along with epd chief john rutledge who we met with and discussed mutual sightings. regards, larry maurer unitel, inc. www.unitel-qht.com larry maurer wrote: major lewis, usaf reserve dallas\\fw tx: please be advised that the craft your people saw were the same we and the eugene police saw in 1982 near eugene, or. we were asked by chief rutledge to contact fbi which we did and the fbi declined investigation. in march 2004, agent john stoffel, dod intel unit, travis afb, said that we should not have taken \"no\" for an answer from the eugene fbi so this case is being persued by dod intel at travis. please contact them concerning our case and the fact that we are currently building a prototype here in the portland area at voxtel, inc. beaverton, or. it is our contention that the sightings are the continuing assistance to us to build and test our space vehicles to perform macroscopic qauntum tunneling (mqt) whereby we can traverse vast distances at ftl and or tunnel in time. i will be available for discussion as i will call dod intel on monday (john stoffel just retired) and discuss same with john's replacement. if you have any further contact with said spacecraft please be advised that the pilots signal with a light source the fibonacci sequence. that will let them know to contact that particular person or pilot by coming into contact as they did with us on oct. 18th, 1981 and landed within 10 ft. from us and turned off the main rgb laser light and turned on the odvs interior light while hovering for a few seconds. i hope to hear your comments on the subject asap. regards, larry d. maurer unitel, inc. quantum holographic technologies portland, or cell 503.780.2011 off. 971.544.1384 www.unitel-qht.com mr. harris: this incident sounds exactly what my coinventor michael miller and i have based on our reverse-engineering (us pat. no. 4,817,102) for our proposed space vehicle. please visit our website at www.unitel-qht.com for more info. the craft descriptions definately sounds like our mqt time travelors and what we intend to build and what the dod intel is supposed to be investigating (meaning our two sightings and eugene, or police dept. request to fbi in 1982). i think that the jet pilots will admit these are opur drones that are incapable of interception with unlimited ceiling and maneuverability (non-ballistic motion). totally silent, quick as a wink and orange carona off the stern with white laser light composed of rgb sections at the bow of each tear-drop shaped drone. we would enjoy discussing the design with yourt news team as well as hooking them up with former chief of eugene police dept. john rutledge. my phone number is 503.780.2011 or msg 971.544.1384. also might explain our patent, web site and our prototype we are building at voxtel, inc., beaverton, or. regards, larry maurer unitel, inc. portland, or"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"None, Light","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar, Teardrop","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.053879,+-123.077144(9794)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9794) map </A>","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-123.077144","Date of the Event":"12/22/1981 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"2nd sighting near Fern Ridge Lake; buzzed by 12 or more teardrop drones orbiting around main body (cigar vehicle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9794.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9794_submitter_file1__Eugene_Police_UFO_1982.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9794.html"],"trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Eugene","There were no other sightings in Eugene on or around December 22nd 1981","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"44.053879","Date Submitted":"12/22/1981 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States"}
