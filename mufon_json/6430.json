I work for a mayor telecom as a switch technician. I���ve been married for 8 years and have one kid with my current wife and two children living in the US. This event happened on Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:19am. I'm pretty sure of the time because I called a friend of mine seconds after the event but the call went unanswered, then I called MUFON. He is a coworker and friend and his mobile shows that I made the call at 12:13. My mother was visiting my brother and came over to the house in order to give my son his birthday gifts. After she came over we planned on connecting over Live for a video chat with my kids in the US. My mother wanted to say hi to them but the kids were walking out the door to go to church and we had to postponed the chat till later that day. We moved over to the back patio to hang out and chat for a bit. We were talking about something when my mother asked me if those things in the sky were kites. The sky was cloudy that day and I had a hard time locating the objects but after a bit of looking I managed to find them. There were two objects in the sky. They were a deep red and round. From my position I could see that one object was behind and at a higher altitude than the other. I could venture a guess as to the altitude of the objects but to be honest I have no idea. Much higher than the normal air traffic we get to see everyday. We get a lot of overhead air traffic so we are used to seeing planes on a daily basis and these did not looked like the ordinary traffic that moves above us. The objects moved very close to each other at a very slow pace. The object that was lower and to the front moved from the right to the left of the other object then they both started ascending on a 120 degree angle of ascension until they moved into clouds and we lost sight of them. The object below flashed a light like a strobe light but I recall the flash only once. The object seemed to be keeping the exact distance with each other. The one thing that I find odd is how clearly I saw the redness of the object. I keep wanting to say that there was a white spot on the red or something but I���m not sure. My mother saw them much longer but by the time she pointed them out to me, I only managed to see them for two maybe three minutes at most, maybe less. It was incredibly exciting to think that it was a UFO and I pointed it out to my mother. I thought afterwards that it could have been a weather balloon because I���ve never read about a red UFO and because of the flashing light. Sincerely yours E.
