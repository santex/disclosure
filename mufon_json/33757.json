{"City":"Bellefontaine","Longitude":"-83.756386","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at church camp, Kirmont, near Bellfountaine, Ohio in about August of 1968. On our last night, a clear starry night, about 120 youth and counsellors were having a worship service on a hilltop at around 9 p.m. We all saw this triangular craft with purple and green lights glide across the sky, not directly overhead, but at about a 45 degree angle. No one discussed what we saw other than to say, \"Oh wow, did you see that?\" It has never left me. Bellfountaine is about an hour by car from Wright Patterson AFB."],"Date Submitted":"12/01/2011 08:17 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12012011-0017","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33757.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33757.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.364194,+-83.756386(33757)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33757) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bellefontaine","There were no other sightings in Bellefontaine on or around August 10th 1968"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ohio","Date of the Event":"08/10/1968 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Object slowly crossed the sky","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"33757","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.364194"}
