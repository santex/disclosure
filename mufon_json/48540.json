I was laying down on the ground I noticed the stars were out very bright and then saw the moving object among the stars. It was witnessed as a star like object moving in a quick motion and a race track formation. After 2 track formation movements the light stopped and disappeared. Approximately 5 minutes later it appeared again and completed a race track formation again and disappeared more quickly that the first time. Total time was approximately 10 minutes for the event. It did not appear again during that evening. I was not scared but curious. I have since been staring at the sky waiting to see it again."],"Date of the Event":"06/27/2013 03:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"[flg] star like light moving quickly in a race track formation then stopped and disappeared","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.29992,+-99.244214(48540)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48540) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/01/2013 01:21 UTC","City":"Harper","Latitude":"30.29992","Longitude":"-99.244214","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48540.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48540.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07012013-0004","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
