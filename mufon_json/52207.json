Above a 2 story house on the next block were lights that looked the size of a frisbee. They were red at first, then rotated closkwise and changed to green, then rotated again and changed to white. The were red longer than green or white. At about 11:00 PM, I went outside toward the house but the lights seemed abostructed by trees so I went home.
