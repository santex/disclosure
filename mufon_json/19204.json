{"Summary":"Two star like lights moving together paralel.","Latitude":"41.612752","divs":["sighting detailsi went to take the trash out about 8:15 on 9\\8\\09. as i turned around from the garbage cans i noticed a very bright light in the sky. i first thought it was a star. i then saw another bright light directly above it. they were vertical coming from the west. the lights were moving together and they looked to be a city block in length from each other. i said to myself \"what the hell is that??!!!\" i went and got my boyfriend. we both watched it. it just seemed to move and float right over our backyard and then turned and went to the north. i couldnt see it any longer because of the trees and house. i have lived near an airport all my life and never have witness anything like this in my life. commercial jets have a flashing light, this had none. this was definately, unidentifiable."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Oak Forest","There were no other sightings in Oak Forest on or around September 8th 2009"],"Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"19204","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Oak Forest","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/09/2009 10:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Illinois","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19204.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19204.html"],"Longitude":"-87.738818","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.612752,+-87.738818(19204)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19204) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/08/2009 08:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-09092009-0032","Tags":"City"}
