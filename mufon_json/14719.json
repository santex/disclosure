{"Longitude":"-77.016678","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting Details Around 3 p.m. on January 3rd I was in downtown Silver Spring. I stopped to photograph what I thought was a unusually dense collection of contrails. I used an iPhone camera. I no longer think them to be odd, though, as all these contrails are headed toward Dulles Airport. Duh. However, upon inspecting the photograph I noticed a black object that I had not noticed while taking the picture. The resolution isn't great, but zooming in on the object located in upper right hand corner, it appears to be two spheres with some indication of exhaust or disturbance to its lower left. As one can tell, the day was extraordinarily sunny. The object has no reflection and it certainly does not appear to be a bird. I'm sure the exact time was noted on the photo file, but I just got the iPhone and don't know how to access that info."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01032009-0011","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Attached photograph.","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Silver Spring","There were no other sightings in Silver Spring on or around January 3rd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"Maryland","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14719.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14719_submitter_file1__IMG_0003.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14719.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.998076,+-77.016678(14719)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14719) map </A>","City":"Silver Spring","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14719","Date Submitted":"01/03/2009 03:15 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"38.998076","Date of the Event":"01/03/2009 03:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
