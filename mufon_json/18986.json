So, I stop, turn down the music and stick my head out of the window to try and hear some noise in case it was just a helicopter. I didnt' hear anything. The light it was emitting was steady, circular and bright. A few seconds later it shot off over the horizon, it traveled so fast it looked like a shooting star.. The light trail it left was the longest i have ever seen and to my eyes it looked like it spand many many miles. I caught my breathe because i was in shock and probably close to a stroke or heart attack at the point. I pulled back on the road and was a little scared because i had to travel the same direction i saw the \"ufo\" travel."]}
