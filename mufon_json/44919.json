It was just before 8pm. It looked like an orange planet flying in my direction and it was right in front of my face. It was orange and very big. If it was in front of me I would say it would be around a square mile in measurement. It was glowing and pulsating like a round sun. I took pictures and video taped it on my cell phone but it only you can only see it glowing white. If I expand the picture, you can see an orange core.
