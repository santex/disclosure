While watching TV, I often watch airplanes coming into the Nashville airport. On the evening of the sighting there were high broken clouds. It was not dark yet and the stars were not visible as yet. Suddenly a stationary very bright twinkling light appeared approximately 20 degrees above the horizon with clouds in the background. The light was visible for about 10 seconds then shot to the right at \"the blink of an eye\" and disappeared. When the light appeared it was approximately 20 degrees to the right of the usual airport flight path for planes coming in from the north. Air traffic that evening was very light and only a helicopter was noted flying from southwest to northeast about five minutes after the sighting."],"Latitude":"36.17142","Case Number":"11353","trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There were no other sightings in Nashville on or around June 30th 2008"],"Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Region":"Tennessee","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Log Number":"US-06302008-0004","Date Submitted":"06/30/2008 08:21 UTC","Summary":"Brief appearance at dusk and suddenly disappeared, shooting off to the right","Object Shape":"Diamond","Longitude":"-86.782053","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11353.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11353.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown"}
