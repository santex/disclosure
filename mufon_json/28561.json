It seemed a circular object at first but would take on a more cigar shape form as the lumination of it changed. There was no sound and at first I thought it was a star or planet until I noticed the short movements and the lumination changing from circular to cigar shaped. I wasn't scared just fascinated. I snapped a couple shots them went into the house to call a sister nearby...when I went back out it was gone."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-95.819986","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.787665,+-95.819986(28561)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28561) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"28561","Country":"United States","City":"Katy","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28561.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28561_submitter_file1__Ummmm.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28561.html"],"Latitude":"29.787665","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Katy","There were no other sightings in Katy on or around April 6th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Object Shape":"Cigar, Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Observed illuminated hovering object in the sky"}
