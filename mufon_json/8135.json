I zoomed in on these photos today as he just told me about it & they are quite interesting. The first photo, the 62, was taken about 2 minutes prior 2 the second 1, being 63, this is due 2 the phones not lighting up properly, as there were others trying 2 take pictures with their phones also. Please find attached the pictures in question.. Thanks in advance 4 your time..."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/25/2007 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"153.028812","Log Number":"AU-10142007-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/25/2007 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"8135","Latitude":"-27.461963","Object Shape":"Cigar, Egg, Oval","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Brisbane","There were no other sightings in Brisbane on or around June 25th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-27.461963,+153.028812(8135)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8135) map </A>","Summary":"Have pictures, bright light with an oblong shape.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
