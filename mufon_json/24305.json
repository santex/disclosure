Both were stationary for more than 5 minutes and then both ascended about another 5 degrees on station as to previous location At all times during observation they appeared to pulse the colors, which caused me to get binoculars to attempt to identify the source. I then realized that they were apparently stationary until one moved to my right and upward, looking to the other I realizes that it too had moved. Both were very star like save for the pulsing of colors."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Terry","There were no other sightings in Terry on or around July 6th 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-105.306509","Log Number":"US-07072010-0007","Case Number":"24305","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Latitude":"46.802493","Date of the Event":"07/06/2010 11:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.802493,+-105.306509(24305)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24305) map </A>"}
