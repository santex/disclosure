This ship dropped smaller ships after appearing from the coast. One of these small ships landed in my garden and then exploded and left behind a small perfectly spherical metal ball. (Which i am having tested at the moment}, although it is extremely heavy, it is very small, i would say a 5x5x5 cm sphere which weighs 30kg. If this piece of metal is placed in the microwave it floats in the middle of the microwave. Before this craft exploded (or imploded) i was quite somber until it shrunk into this tiny pellet. I would like to know from you if this craft could be \"increased\" to its original state in order to utilise its amazing technology"],"Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
