As I was walking to the bin area, I notice something out of place moving fast in the sky. First imprison, I said to myself look at that bird flying. Next, I said it's moving very fast and it dark out. As it moved I noticed only the reflection from the moon on top and on the bottom it was darker then the regular night sky.
