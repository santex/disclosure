I went inside to get my binoculars for a clearer look because the object was very far to the south. It seemed to be flashing white, then red, then a blueish green. I then called my wife and son out to also have a look. They both saw it. We then began to look around and counted eight total in different distances and positions, all in the souther sky. We could not find anything even similar in any area of the sky except the south. They did not move for the hour or so that we watched them. We then went inside and our direct tv flashed and lost it's signal very briefly. Unknown if this had anything to do with what we saw other than our dish points to the south."],"trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Nampa","There were no other sightings in Nampa on or around August 26th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"08/26/2009 10:35 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-08272009-0003","Summary":"seen a light very far to the south that was flashing very fast and not moving"}
