(i noticed this when i went out on to the deck) it wasn't until i started showing them to friends and family that it occured to me that i may have actually caught something unusual. the following night, i look out at the house across the field from us and could plainly see that when they left outside house light on, you could see part of the structure illuminated, so i know that isn't what i saw the night before. i hope you can give me some more information on what this might be. you will notice that the first picture is lighter than the rest. i accidentally had the flash on for the this photo. (i have a few more photos if you would like to have them as well)"],"Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"11900","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11900.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11900_submitter_file1__062.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11900_submitter_file2__063.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11900_submitter_file3__065.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11900.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"39.412055","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Oakland","There was one other sighting in Oakland on or around July 24th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
