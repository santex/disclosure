{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in the back patio area of my house. I saw a bright yellow light appear around 30 degrees in east over some trees. My first thought was someone had shot of some fireworks. Object traveled directly overhead east to west. Spotted at 9:30 disappeared into west horizon at 9:37 pm. Looked through binoculars and saw a grayish spehrical outline above light as it moved to west No noise when it passed overhead. Winds were light and variable. Object appeared to be moving faster than a commercial jet would on final approach to Standiford Field. The light seem to flicker almost like a candle."],"Log Number":"US-07102012-0002","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Louisville","There was one other sighting in Louisville on or around July 9th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"40650","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-85.751856","Date of the Event":"07/09/2012 09:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"07/10/2012 12:12 UTC","Region":"Kentucky","Object Features":"None","Summary":"yellow flickering orb moved west to east 10pm speed 100mph+","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Louisville","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40650.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40650.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.256545,+-85.751856(40650)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40650) map </A>","Latitude":"38.256545","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
