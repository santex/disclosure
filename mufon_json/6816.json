{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc","divs":["sighting detailsi have had repeated close encounters with entities over the years. these normally took the form of obe's and did not include the typical grey alien beings. rather the beings took many forms, and always had an enormously powerful effect on my personal spiritual development. at no time did i ever equate these experiences with the ufo phenomena. however, during a 6 month period in 1992 my family and i were visited on numerous occasions in what appeared to be a fairly common fashion according to research i conducted following the events. at the time i was relentlessly forced into convinction that a foreign intelligence was determined to reach me and members of my family in what could only be described as a deeply spiritual message. of the many incidents the one that sticks out the most began late one evening. my wife and two young children were asleep in their own rooms (daughter 4 and son 1). the night was eerily quite. i was experiencing feelings of being watched, chills, unwarranted fear, ringing in my ears and rapid heart beat. my two large dogs were also experiencing fear and distress. for no reason that i can explain i went around our home and turned on all the lights - going downstairs was particularly frightening. i then turned on the tv. in a matter of minutes the atmosphere became truly strange. first, every channel i turned to was featuring shows on ufo's! in an instant i was experiencing feelings of death, and judgement. suddenly i sensed\\envisioned a being entering my son's room. at that very instant he began crying and calling out. the timing betwen those two events was chilling. as i went down the hallway and opened his bedroom door he was fast asleep and lying on his back. what caught my attention was for a split second i thought i saw a bright blue glowing ball of light on the centre of his forehead. at that very instant ths 1 1\\2 year old sat up and waved out his bedroom window and then laid back down and was deep asleep. i picked him up and he was so deeply asleep that i could not wake him. although the event was very strange, i felt that i was either imagining things, or, that there was nothing i could do other than remain awake and stand in vigil over my family. i went back to the living room. in seconds i saw\\felt something go into my daughter's room. at once she began to scream. i ran down the hall and as i opened her bedroom door i felt something walk right through me. my head felt like it was standing straight up and i was shuddering - i'm experiencing mild chills as i write. as i stood in the doorway my daughter looked at me and screamed. somehow i 'knew' that whatever was in her dream and passed through me in the doorway and that she had mistaken me for whatever it was. by the time i got to her side she was also deeply asleep! i remember thinking that hollywood couldn't have produced a scarier film as this was becoming extremely strange and frightening. oddly, i felt very familiar with all of those sensations, although i couldn't place when exactly i had ever encountered anything like what was happening. on another level, something was begining to breakdown within me. in the past i had kept some very strange experiences at what could be described as an intellectual arm's length when it came to my sense of reality or world view. suddenly, these very same feelings were clearly happening outside of my imagination or so it seemed, as other people appeared to be experiencing being acted upon! in an effort to combat this encounter, i chose act as if nothing was happening and to go to bed myself. ordinarily it takes me quite a while to fall asleep, but on this night it seemed as if i had just laid my head down and i 'sank' deep into the pillow and was asleep in an instant. the next thing i knew i was standing in my hallway in my dream. as i have had many obe experiences i 'knew' i was dreaming and cold actually govern my actions much as if i were awake. i looked down the hall into the bathroom and was shocked to see and alien looking directly at me. i 'knew' the he had been who was in the house earlier and had somehow 'arranged' to get me to see him. he was approximately 5 feet tall, had grey skin and only one large black eye, his left. this was shaped similarly to the common version of the grey alien beings. deeply afraid and shocked i woke up immediately. again, i sensed the being moving into my son's room, and again my son called out in his sleep. i was both shocked, afraid and somehow accepting of the situation. i got up and checked on my son again and he was asleep as before. i returned to bed, but rather than try to sleep, i turned on a light and began to read. there was no way i was going back to sleep! at that moment, i sensed the being coming into our bedroom and my wife jumped right out of a deep sleep and screamed! without wasting a second i asked her, \"what were you dreaming about\"? she replied that she was on an operating table and a number of aliens were there. one of them told her not to be afraid, he had 'only one eye, his left one'! she fell back asleep in what seemed like seconds. for the next few hours the being kept wandering through the house. i could sense where he was, and sure enough my family would talk or call out when he 'seemed' to be in their rooms. at dawn, i finally fell asleep myself. in the morning my daughter came out of her room and told me that she had seen a spaceship floating over our boat that was stored in the backyard. this 4 year old child went on to describe the ship (as above) and that there were2 being on our back deck and three in her room. they had inserted a long needle into her belly button that hurt terribly. she was concerned that she was going to bleed on her bed. i interupted the procedure and then they left. she later indentfied the beings as the grey type with shiny black eyes and black one piece suits. i can recount many more such experiences. what i feel i must do however is to undergo regressive hypnosis and remember what was been said to me as i am convinced that something very important was shown to me. thank you for reading. michael beighton"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Green, orange and white lights underneath.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Gravenhurst","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Latitude":"44.919643","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-79.374183","Date of the Event":"06/14/1992 12:00 UTC","Region":"Ontario","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6816.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6816.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.919643,+-79.374183(6816)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6816) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Case Number":"6816","Date Submitted":"06/14/1992 12:00 UTC","City":"Gravenhurst","Log Number":"CA-04142007-0004"}
