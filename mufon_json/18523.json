{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["sighting detailsi was heading west on i\\12 just going past the northshore blvd\\airport rd. exit in slidell at 3:00 am (pitch black at this time with some clouds in area) when i noticed a red light off to my south. i began watching this light as it wasn't flying very high above the trees (maybe around 3,000 feet) but due to the lack of light i could never make out a shape to this vehicle. as i continued driving west on i-12, this red light continued flying its same direction and when it flew far enough in front of me i could then make out 2 midsized red lights (not small strobing lights like you would find under a commerical plane). the 2 red lights were flashing separately of each other but were flashing\\pulsing very fast. as i approached the lacombe\\st. tammany exit (between 3 to 4 miles away from where i first noticed it) this vehicle changed it's course and began to head west-northwest and flew directly over i-12. as i was about 2 or 3 blocks in back of it as it veered over i-12 at the lacombe exit i then could make out 4 small white strobing lights in between the larger 2 red fast pulsing lights. i still could not make out a shape to this vehicle, i could not hear any noise coming from it either. about 2 to 3 blocks in front of me on i-12 heading west at 3am were 4 cars (they weren't bottle necking each other and had room to pass the other cars). these cars had just gone past the lacombe exit (as i watched these fast pulsing lights directly in front of me) as this vehicle flew directly over the cars; when this happened 2 of the cars did hit their brakes so i can only think that they were startled to see something going over them. never at any time could i make out a shape to this flying object. now i live in the flight paths to both armstrong international and the new orleans municipal airports and i see planes heading to both airports everyday\\night. i walk my dogs every night and can see planes coming for miles. never once have i ever seen a plane with these types of lights but i could certainly be wrong. i am hoping that someone else may be able to clarify this incident if they saw it. i am sure that this object did not take off from the small slidell municipal airport as it would've had to fly in front of me before i began to witness it to my south. neither do i believe it was heading back to that airport as it was heading in the direction of abita springs\\covington when i last saw the lights through the tall pine trees."],"Latitude":"30.281494","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Louisiana","Summary":"2 midsized red flashing lights with 4 white strobing lights in between.","City":"Slidell","Date of the Event":"08/01/2009 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.281494,+-89.780064(18523)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18523) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18523.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18523.html"],"Log Number":"US-08072009-0007","Case Number":"18523","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Slidell","There was one other sighting in Slidell on or around August 1st 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date Submitted":"08/01/2009 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-89.780064"}
