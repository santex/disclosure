I am in a flight path for airplanes so I thought there was a plane flying towards the airport, but the light was orange and not white like the normal landing lights. I thought there was also red and green lights on either side of the orange light, but I am not sure. Then I asked my friend to take a look at this plane. At this point the first object began to ascend. Then my friend pointed out a second object that was doing the same thing as the first. It also appeared to be ascending because the light kept getting smaller and eventually faded out. I felt no nervousness and reacted very calmly. My friend expressed concern and thought it this was pretty crazy, but didn't have much anxiety from it."],"Longitude":"-121.836377","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43565.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43565.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/28/2012 02:50 UTC","Case Number":"43565","City":"San Jose","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were no other sightings in San Jose on or around October 27th 2012"]}
