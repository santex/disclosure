It looked just like a very distant star(I guess that's obvious), anyway, At first I thought it was just a satelite but then I realized it was barely moiving. I watched it blink presicely every 7 seconds for 10 minutes before I decided to go inside. I have seen many satelites but they move much faster. This object appeared inside Orion, above the belt moving to the west. In ten minutes of veiwing it moved from just north of Bellatrix to just SSE of Betelguese, blinking every 7 seconds."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.249744,+-73.191139(21578)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21578) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/21/2010 09:50 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-73.191139","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"01/21/2010 09:58 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Connecticut","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21578.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21578.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Starlike object blinking every 7 seconds.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Trumbull","There were no other sightings in Trumbull on or around January 21st 2010"],"Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"21578"}
