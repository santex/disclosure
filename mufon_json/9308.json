It wasn't hovering over my house, it was hovering over the other side of the railroad tracks about 300 ft. in the air. I can't explain anymore it was in broad daylight on a sunny day, and I was too busy taking my dog for his daily walk. But I tried to focus on it as much as I could. When I got back to my house, it was already gone. I noticed it, because I frequently look up into the sky to see the beautiful red sky. I just noticed something not moving and it's odd shape. It was not a plane or helicopter. I've never seen anything like it before in my life. I couldn't take any photos of it because I lost my camera for sometime, and plus I was walking my dog."],"trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around September 2nd 2007"]}
