Glanced up at the night sky straight overhead, and the very moment I looked up, there was this huge light flash way up in the sky, and then nothing. I heard nothing, saw nothing more. The span of the light was too big and too high up to have been a landing light from a plane. Some may call it a \"blink\" but it was only one blink and it was not like a twinkle. The flash was huge, it covered an enormous portion of the sky for that one second."],"Region":"Colorado","Log Number":"US-01122010-0021"}
