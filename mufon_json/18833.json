I didnt see any flashing lights and it was really quite. So I continued to watch as it seemed real close to the ground to be a star? Anyway it continued North East kinda slow and fast, sometimes it would dim and then get bright. I lost it over time cause of the trees but it was definitly not anything I've ever seen. As I was watching that one I noticed a larger star like object, also too close to the ground to be a star just hovering over like St. Paul, it was doing the same dim then get bright but it never moved so i went back to sleep, tried too anyway."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18833.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18833.html"],"Summary":"Moving slow in a sort of zig-zag motion and it was real quite","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"18833"}
