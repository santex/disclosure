My children and I were watching the sky because we noticed helicopter activity. My daughter thought they were military copters. We looked to the north sky and saw two rows of orange lights. They were hanging in the air low; just above trees about a mile away. They lights seemed to keep a semi-straight row per row. I had to go to another location three minutes down the road and when we arrived, we couldn't see the lights anymore. There was a lot of helicopter activity that night. When I saw the lights, I did not feel anything but wonder. I could not figure out what I saw."],"Longitude":"-82.897413","Summary":"Two rows of orange balls light 1 over other. hovered low in north sky. 8 to 12 lights. two helicopters in area as well."}
