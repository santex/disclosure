It was crisp and totally clear sky with excellent visibility. I looked up and saw a planetary sized light to the northwest at about 80 degrees from the horizon. It caught my eye because it was bright and I had never seen a star or planet in that position at that time. I looked closely at it and it was white and starlike and perfectly circular. In something less than a minute of observation, it faded out - not twinkling out like a star and other stars that were less visible were still plainly visible in the brightening sky. It faded out quickly - just disappeared. I looked for it for another minute or so and it did not reappear. It was stationary and should have still been visible in some form. I have seen iridium flares and know it was not this. There was no change in light intensity."],"City":"Katy","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/25/2013 07:08 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Circle","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"51843","Date Submitted":"10/26/2013 12:31 UTC","Longitude":"-95.804694","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51843.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51843.html"],"Latitude":"29.839769"}
