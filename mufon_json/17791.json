I looked to the northeast of our vehicle and saw what looked like light rising into the air. After a little while it became obvious that they weren't rising, but moving. There were about 15-20 lights in the sky flying in a loose formation from north to south. There was a main group and a smaller group further behind of about 5 lights. Many people were pulling over to view the lights. One woman in the car next to us asked us what they were. I kept thinking that they were most likely aircraft. But they were flying low in a very loose formation with bright lights on, which seemed odd to me. It is certainly something I've never seen before. We lost sight of the lights when they continued south and were too far away to continue viewing."],"Log Number":"US-07042009-0012","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17791.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17791_submitter_file1__lights_in_sky.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17791.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.634602,+-75.363908(17791)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17791) map </A>","Latitude":"40.634602","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
