Submitted":"10/28/2008 07:47 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsfirst i'd like to say that the only reason i'm reporting this is because i just saw the ufos over earth fayettevile incident episode and noticed that there were some similarities. my sighting took place the day after the episode aired and i did not know about the show until after my sighting, when i googled the terms \"fayetteville, nc\" ufo. i googled that to see if anyone else had posted on the internet about seeing what i saw that night. i wasn't as much interested in older sightings as i was interested in finding someone else who saw the same thing that night. after googling that, i saw a description of the show, learned that it aired the night before, and sought it out on the internet so i could watch it. my story is extremely uneventful, but i figured i'd report it anyway as it could help to see the similarities in other cases from this area. myself and my boyfriend were traveling down bragg blvd, coming from downtown fayetteville, headed towards the sycamore dairy rd. intersection. i observed 3 large orange lights in the sky. higher than street lights, but low enough to catch my eye and seem strange. the road we were traveling on is quite a busy road so i kept looking around to see if anyone else was looking at the lights, it did not appear so. the 3 lights were orange in color and looked almost identical to the street lights that line bragg blvd, and most of fayetteville. they were about the same size. my boyfriend and i first thought it was 3 airplanes in formation, headed towards us, with very large headlights or something. we couldn't stop staring at them, waiting to see if they are airplanes or if they zoomed away in true ufo fashion. these 3 lights were in a diagonal line, the highest light being toward the right, and the lowest light at the left. they were appx. a half inch apart from our line of vision. all of a sudden, the bottom left light disappeared in the blink of an eye and reappeared on top of the formation in the right. it happened so quickly, that we at first thought a 4th light appeared. but really, only 3 were visible. that happened again, in the blink of an eye the lights rearranged with a new one seemingly appearing at the top of the formation, but still only 3 were visible. we could not see the lights moving. just popping up suddenly in a new spot, but the entire time they remained in the diagonal line and only 3. i am not sure how long this whole event happened. it seems like about 3 minutes, but it may have been shorter. i have seen planes dropping flares before and it was similar to that, except the lights stayed stationary and illuminated much longer than the flares i've seen. we continued staring at them while traveling up bragg blvd when the light on the top right just blinked out. it was gone and only 2 lights remained. i'd like to add that nowhere near these 3 lights were any blinking lights like those on common aircraft. just these 3, large, orange orbs. they did not move, they were not traveling, they seemed to be hovering. then, about 30 seconds after the first light disappeared, the 2nd light disappeared. at this moment i decided to take my cellphone out and try to get a photo. only 1 light remained at this point and i knew my cellphone wasn't good at taking quality photos but i tried anyway. that is how i know the exact time of this sighting, because of the time stamp on my photo. i took the photo and the light is visible, although it is whiter and smaller in the photo. i was still looking through my cellphone about to take another photo, waiting for the camera to get ready, when i saw the final light blink out. it happened the same instance i snapped the second photo and in the second photo there are no lights. the time stamp on the 2nd photo is 3-5 seconds after the first and the light is gone. we continued on our way and were heading towards where the lights were but did not see or hear anything else in the sky that night. it was slightly unsettling but mostly very strange. we do not know if this was some type of aircraft from fort bragg, but we both agree that this was not like any aircraft we've ever seen before. i will include the photo of the 1 orb that i got just before it disappeared. like i said before, it is quite unimpressive, but it is all that i have from the incident. there are lots of other lights in the photo, as it is night time and we are on a busy road. so i put a white arrow pointing at the light that is unexplainable. i know it isn't a good photo, but at least it can give an idea of how low\\high this was in the sky. thanks for your time."],"Sighting
