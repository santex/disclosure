{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Detailswe went to observe comet from foothills in N Phoenix and on the way back weobserved object over south mountain many miles away and it was huge. It lookedlike a very large building with the lights on about 20-30 miles away except itwas above the mountain in the air. I would say it was twice the size of 6-7stories of a skyscraper that could also be seen downtown approx. same distance.Then noticed some of the lights were going off and on. It just hovered, slowlydescending.we saw it off and on for about 5 minutes until we got into the flatsof the valley. We then went to a church parking lot open area to see if we couldsee it but it was gone.I could barely tell that it had a frame of some sortsupporting the lights but we were just to far away to tell much about it.Theentire object was rigid frame and lights during the observation. Ive been aMETAR observer in the past and have worked on a army test range USAYPGand cannotcompare it to any air vehicle ive ever seen."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3007.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3007.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Case Number":"3007","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","City":"Phoenix","Date Submitted":"05/06/2004 07:40 UTC","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around May 6th 2004"],"Summary":"mass of lights around south mountain in Phoenix,Az","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.456377,+-112.071987(3007)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3007) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.456377","Log Number":"","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"05/06/2004 07:40 UTC","Longitude":"-112.071987","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown"}
