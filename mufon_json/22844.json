{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt about 8:45 pm eastern time I was star gazing with our family when an orange glow appeared in the sky. We were looking at a shooting star then the ball appeared. The orange glow was about 5 times the size of the stars The orange glow was going about 30 degrees above the horizon, from north to south in the Eastern sky. Then two military style planes appeared behind it and it flew into the tree line out of sight. About 10-15 minutes later another ball appear going the opposite dirrection ( west to east and desending) then disappeared in the clouds. At first we thought that it was volcano related then 26 planes headed towards Charlotte's airport withing a five minute period, from all directions, two almost colliding from our veiwpoint. And this went on for about 20 minutes then normal flight patterns resumed. Between the weird orange ball and the unusual flight patterns something strange is occuring."],"Log Number":"US-04152010-0018","Object Features":"None","Region":"North Carolina","City":"nebo","Case Number":"22844","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"35.715","Sighting Duration":"00:25:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22844.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22844.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/15/2010 10:13 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in nebo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"04/15/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.715,+-81.93111(22844)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22844) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-81.93111","Summary":"bright orange spherical glow in the eastern night sky","Country":"United States"}
