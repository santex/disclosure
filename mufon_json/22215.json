weren���t they invited when the us welcome them by placing plaques on board the 1972 pioneer 10 and on the 1973 pioneer 11 spacecraft, featuring a pictorial messages detailing our composition, the location of our planet, and our sun in case either pioneer 10 or 11 were intercepted by extraterrestrial life? it���s no wonder they���re prancing into our solar system trying to say ���we���re here! mrs. nch i had posted my initial sighting on january 17, 2009 at 11:20am on the following website: january 17, 2009 at 11:20 am at http:\\\\dandare.wordpress.com\\readers-encounters\\#comment-4401"],"Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/07/2010 11:13 UTC","Tags":"City"}
