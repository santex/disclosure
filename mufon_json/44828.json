He said he had to talk to me. He was visiablly shaken. This guy hardly ever jokes about anything. He told me when driving in to work, about three miles from plant gate he looks up to bright lights. It was like the object was following his vehicle. The object was shaped like a horse track with all these brights non flashing. Couldn't see the top or sides since it seemed to stay almost overhead. He was amazed at the overall size and so many lights. The whole time he was talking he was shaking. His eyes were wide open and talked faster than normal. He couldn't explain how fast it left. Said it started to move ahead of his vehicle at a fast speed and like that lights out. He told me not to tell anyone. He thought he would be laughed at. This guy is a straight shooter and on the serious side of life. I know he told me what he saw and was shaken up from the event."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in New Washington","There were no other sightings in New Washington on or around October 1st 1981"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"10/01/1981 11:00 UTC","Summary":"co-worker driving into work spots large object above vehicle very bright lights","Longitude":"-85.505614","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Indiana","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.592076,+-85.505614(44828)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44828) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/28/2012 03:58 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
