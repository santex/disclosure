My sister thinks that it was more square-shaped. My sister noticed it first, when she was looking up in the sky. Then two minutes later she told me about it, and I saw it. At first I though it was a sky diver, but it didn't seem to go down at all. I saw that it was triangular and curved at the edges. It was green except for the center to the back of the object which was black. As it was getting farther away, it became very hard to see. When it was far away, occasional flashes appered under it. It kept on going until we could't see it anymore."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Triangle","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06242007-0005","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"7306","City":"Hollywood","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7306.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7306.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"26.016261","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Date of the Event":"06/23/2007 06:45 UTC"}
