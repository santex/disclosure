I was looking at Orion and notice a movement of what at first looked like a whisp of a cloud. Looking directly at it I new it was not natural and had a solid triangular body to it. I told my son to look at it, that it was a UFO. We watched it until the roof blocked the view. I then jumped out and ran in the house to tell another child to come see the ufo. we ran out the front and then I retreated to the house as I was naked and dripping wet from the hot tub. He later came to the back and said he had seen it too. (I had seen a simmilar craft about ten years ago 50 miles to the north. It was traveling north to south.)"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/27/2006 08:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4590.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4590.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Latitude":"42.879173","Longitude":"-112.443134","Log Number":"US-03272006-0004","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Idaho","Summary":"Object moved from South to North, was silent, Large - width was about OrionÅ sholders -, It apeared triangular with a curved corona glow from right tip around the tip and trailed off the left tip.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.879173,+-112.443134(4590)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4590) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/27/2006 08:15 UTC"}
