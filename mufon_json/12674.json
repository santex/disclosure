At first i thought it was an airplane but it wasn't moving and none of its lights were blinking. i watched it for a little while and it started moving a little and then it took off in an incredible speed i knew it wasn't an airplane then because no airplane could go from floating in the air like that to that kindof speed. when it took off it made a little streak of light behing it. i started freaking out and saying i just saw a ufo."],"Date Submitted":"06/30/2005 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-117.290502","Region":"British Columbia","Summary":"lights on each corner and one big one in the center","Latitude":"49.497291"}
