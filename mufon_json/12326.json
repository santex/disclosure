They didn't know what it was and thought it was a parachute or Hang Glider. However it was way too large for either of these to be true. My guess is it was about 10-15 miles away, and it was much larger than the Military Helicopter that happened to be in the air, it was closer, and coming towards us from where the craft was. It was also heading over the mountain east of the city so if it were a hang glider or parachute as my siblings thought, as it would not have been going towards the mountain. It was very low and just barely above the mountain. I kept an eye on it and after a couple minutes of not looking it was gone."],"trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were no other sightings in Albuquerque on or around August 10th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.087191,+-106.644727(12326)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12326) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09022008-0019","Disposition":"Unknown"}
