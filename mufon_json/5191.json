{"divs":["sighting detailsi have been thinking about whether or not to report this last sighting. when i read the report from 2006-08-02 in ohio, i read something similar to what i had seen only days before. i am curious as to how close these people are to pa?... anyway, i decided to stay the night at a friends house. we were sitting outside for a couple of hours, just watching the stars. i live in pittsburgh, and take any chance i can to get away from the city lights and look at the stars. on this night, right around 2:15 am i noticed a very bright orange light to the south. i watched at it approached (heading due north). as it was approaching, it appeared to be a single orange, very bright light. it was flashing on and off. when it was off, nothing was visable. no other marker lights, no outline of a craft, etc. i got up out of my chair and walked out into the yard for a more clear view. as the object got to be close to perpendicular to me, i noticed the single orange flash, was actually a series of approximately 5-6 very quick flashes. at this point, the object was fairly close to me. held at an arms length, a nickle would probably just cover the object up. i noticed no noise coming from the vehicle. and, even at this close range, the short time in the cycle where the orange lights were off on the craft, i still could not make out a shape, nor were there any marker lights. just black. as the craft continued on, i could see much more clearly the light set up and flashing pattern from the rear. there were 5-6 round orange lights all lined up in a row. three larger lights, on what i could only call the 'bottom' of the craft, as well as 2-3 more which swept up to the rear at appx. a 30* angle. the rear up-swept lights appeared to get progressively smaller from the 'bottom' 3. the flashing was a chasing motion, clockwise, from front to back. after the last flash, there was about a 1\\2 second pause where you could see nothing. and then the first 'bottom' light would again fire. i watched this craft with amazement from virtually horizon to horizon. i have no idea what it was. my friend, witnessed the same thing, and had actually called me the week previous to tell me he had seen orange lights in the sky. i was half asleep at the time. his only reaction to the sighting was, \"see, i told you. you didn't believe me, did you?\". very strange indeed. it sounds very much like the ohio report. the only difference is what i saw continued this flashing pattern all of the way across the sky. more people have to be seeing these things..."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"5191","Sighting Duration":"02:15:00","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/30/2006 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"07/30/2006 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-08052006-0001","Object Shape":"Disc, Unknown","Latitude":"40.687288","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Summary":"5 clockwise flashing orange lights Similar to OH report on 2006-08-02","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Monaca","Longitude":"-80.27145","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Monaca","There were no other sightings in Monaca on or around July 30th 2006"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5191.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5191.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.687288,+-80.27145(5191)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5191) map </A>"}
