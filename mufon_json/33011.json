I stopped to watch, it came forward then made u-turn, just south of van Nuys Airport.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was returning home on Sherman Way boulevard in van Nuys just south of the van Nuys Airport. I was heading west when I looked to my left and saw a around object approximately 8 feet in diameter hovering just above the treetops. It was silhouetted against the sky. It looked like polished aluminum, and made no sound. I pulled over to the right to watch it. I had no idea what it was. It came forward approximately 5 miles an hour for a few feet, and made a u-turn, \" never varying in speed\" not even in the most Minute way, unlike any of our aircraft. It was like a marble rolling on a sheet of glass above the treetops. I was 115 feet away from it, when I first saw it. (I measured it) It continued to go north just above the treetops, until it was out of sight Back then there was nobody to report it to, and it's barely better now, but I swear on my life it happened."],"Case Number":"33011","City":"Los Angeles","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around May 8th 1973"],"Longitude":"-118.448857","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"10/31/2011 06:20 UTC","Latitude":"34.197387","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Other","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
