I pulled off to the side of the highway to investigate. Although the object seemed high in the sky at first, it seemed to hover lower toward the ground. I was specifically looking for flashing lights that would indicate that it was an aircraft. However, none were observed. The light was bright, unwavering and looked like a star. Object was moving slowly, hovering and then the light disappeared. I kept an eye on the object as long as I could. After the lights went out, the object was a dull grey and appeared to be spinning. I eventually lost track of the object. I recorded the video on my phone and upon examination later, a ring of orbs appeared in place of what appeared to the naked eye as the grey object. I could not see the ring of lights until viewing the video on my cell phone."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"02/02/2013 11:33 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been 66 other sightings in Jacksonville","There was one other sighting in Jacksonville on or around February 2nd 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
