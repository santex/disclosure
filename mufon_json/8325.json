In the northwest part of Vegas. I wasn't really doing anything but thinking of getting home. Suddenly I noticed this giant light above me from my windshield. It looked like it was no higher than a helicopter would be surveying the area. But, once I looked and saw this giant light, before I knew it .. it zipped and raced off into the distance north into a dot of nothing in seconds! I honestly first thought. That was a ufo. I have never seen one. I have never given much thought to them. Or interest. In fact, two months before I told someone \"i dont' think one way or the other, i believe anythign is possible. im just probably one of those people that will never see anything.\" I just found out tonight. The day after that the UFO conference was here in Las Vegas. I still don't know if it could be a star or comet, being so close to the earth and going straight forward into some warp of speed into nothing."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8325.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8325.html"],"Log Number":"US-11122007-0001","Country":"United States","Case Number":"8325","Date Submitted":"11/10/2007 12:00 UTC","Summary":"a giant ball of pure white light... high up above car then zipped and raced ahead into nothing.","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"36.124196","City":"Las Vegas","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/10/2007 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-115.163616","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There was one other sighting in Las Vegas on or around November 10th 2007"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Nevada","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
