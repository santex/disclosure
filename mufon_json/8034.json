Using my binoculars I could see dark grey dots and had a job keeping track of them as they were moving quite fast. The conditions were bright overcast and the dots were below the clouds. The speed of the objects attracted my attention. Apart from possibly being military jets, I have no idea what these might of been. Certainly not birds.
