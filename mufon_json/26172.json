One night the power was out and me and my brother was standing in the kitchen looking out towards the road because we saw this bright blue light that seamed to just get brighter and brighter with no explanation. We thought Ok is this a car? Why is this light getting brighter and brighter and bigger? We opened the door and went outside and before we could make our way to the barn the light just vanished and we had an eery feeling so we went back inside the house."],"City":"Chesterville","Longitude":"-70.08667"}
