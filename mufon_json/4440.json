{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was inside fixing to go to bed and looked out the bedroom window. There were so many lights that were all moving. It was something very strange with no sound. There were so many lights moving coming in from the west. They seemed to be converging in one spot and then would disappear with more moving in. This went on for two hours that my wife and I watched. We even rode in the car trying to get closer with some passing over the car. There was no sound. We could not figure out what this was. We live in a rural area. Where we saw them across the way there is no one living in that area, just cotton fields and trees. It stopped around 2 o'clock. We soon went to bed after we noticed no further activity. It was very frightening not knowing what it was. Have never seen anything like this before. The next day another strange occurance was that all of our car clocks had lost time. It seemed as though there may have been a magnetic field that had done something to them."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4440.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4440.html"],"City":"Marks","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"4440","Summary":"40--50 flying objects slowly descending over ground, total silence, all we could see were lights moving vertically","Log Number":"US-02172006-0004","Date of the Event":"01/30/2006 11:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/30/2006 11:30 UTC","Region":"Mississippi","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.2565","Longitude":"-90.272038","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.2565,+-90.272038(4440)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4440) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Marks","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
