{"divs":["sighting detailsi looked out my 3rd story window and saw a commercial airline on its usual path,when i noticed a star-like object tailing it not far behind the airliner.it swayed from side to side,then went under the airliner,and then back behind it again,untill they were both out of my sight.the amount of time i watched was under 5 minutes aprox.i did not know what it was or could have been,thus why i'm reporting it.i will say that these unusual lights or whatever they are,are often in the skies above.i think most people don't look up at the sky,along with our eyes\\senses are not as strong as maybe they once were.it amazes me how oblivious people can be.this is my second time reporting a ufo,although i have neglected to report any others.i recently found out about this site,and i will encourage others who have seen ufos to report."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Witnessed a UFO tailing a commercial airliner.It was star-like & very fast.","City":"Columbus","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"01/30/2009 08:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 70 other sightings in Columbus","There were no other sightings in Columbus on or around January 30th 2009"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.964016,+-82.995134(15228)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15228) map </A>","Case Number":"15228","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15228.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15228.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.964016","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Longitude":"-82.995134","Date Submitted":"01/30/2009 08:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-01312009-0009"}
