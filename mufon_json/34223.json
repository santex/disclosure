I looked up, and just up in the sky was a triangle UFO with FOUR LIGHTS. I was on the phone at the time with a friend and I said, \"i think I am seeing a UFO above me\". She replied that I should take a photo. I pointed my i-phone at it a second later and was able to get these two shots as it was disappearing. When I blow these up you can clearly see a TRIANGLE ship with a huge lead light and three tail lights."],"Date Submitted":"12/20/2011 11:07 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34223.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34223_submitter_file1__photo3(1).JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34223.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
