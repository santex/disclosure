My wife Susan and I were standing outside our door watching for neighbors��� fireworks. We observed two round orange glowing objects crossing west to east at around 30 to 40 degrees in the southern sky. There was no audible sound from them. At first glimpse I thought they there were fireworks. Then I noticed they appeared to be moving horizontally and round in shape. They remained in formation with one flying behind and below the one in front at all time as they passed from sight behind trees. We watched the objects cross the sky for about 10 seconds or more. When I noticed they were in flight formation, my impression was I was witnessing similar objects seen by World War Two aviators called ���Foo Fighters���."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Michigan","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:24 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40281.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40281.html"],"Latitude":"42.178899"}
