It had been raining all day, yet the skies were clear. I was looking at the stars and watching the air traffic in the area after having dinner with my wife. I continued walking, and facing west, noticed something moving in the sky. I looked up to observe a very small, very dimly lit triangular object moving roughly northwest, very quickly. It had very small, very dim white lights on the bottom, at least 6 or 8, and appeared to be very low, under 5,000 ft by my estimation. There was absolutely no sound, and the street I was nearby was very quiet at the time. The object moved very quickly, and went behind the apartments ahead of me before I had a chance to get to a better viewing position. This object was clearly not a helicopter, small plane, or commercial aircraft. It was too small, too quiet, too dimly lit, and too fast. I was immediately struck with disbelief, and felt like it had to be something easily explainable, but the more I thought about it, the less likely that seemed."]}
