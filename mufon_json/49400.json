I bright, colorful sphere, that appeared to be made of rotating round edged squares pulsated and looped around a center red dot. At first I thought was probably a helicopter, but it made absolutely no sound and I was certainly close enough to have heard it. It did not have aviation lights. The object (orb) at first just hovered. The squares that rotated around the center were a combination of red, yellow-orange and yellow and just rotated around a center red dot in a manner to give the object a spherical appearance. After approximately 30 seconds it began to slowly move to the northwest and increase it's altitude. After approximately another 45 seconds it briefly glowed brighter and then just faded out of what I would call existence."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-80.623566","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Islamorada","There was one other sighting in Islamorada on or around August 2nd 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change"}
