So we checkedoutside at the power lines and saw a see-through object coming toward theground. We also saw lights flashing. We started to get really scared and wehid. We watched from a distance and took pictures of it, well, kindof squirtingout gas like liquid. Its hard to describe. Transparent. Well all of a suddenit got up and flew away. But the shadows all around are, its almost like thereis something there. Im afraid to go near a shadow now.
