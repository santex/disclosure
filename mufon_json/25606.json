Intersection of Edgebrook and Balcones. Exact date unknown. It was approximately midnight. I was 22 at the time. Still living with my parents and attending college. My mother and I decided to get out for a midnight snack. We headed to the convenient store about a mile away. We crossed over Edgebrook into the median. Before crossing to the other side we noticed this large disc-shaped object with white lights all around the outside of the craft. It seemed as though it were about 30 or 40 feet wide. It hovered over our car for about 45 secs. We were in total disbelief. It seemed as though it were really low. Like perhaps 100 feet above us. We looked at each other after both viewing the object. Then looked back for about 10 secs at the unknown craft. There was complete and utter silence. The craft made no noise. Then it simply disappeared at a high rate of speed. The object was truly a UFO. I have never seen anything that closely resembles what I saw before or after that night."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25606.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25606.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City","Case Number":"25606","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around November 30th 1991"],"Object Shape":"Disc","City":"Houston","Latitude":"29.768663","Log Number":"US-09282010-0014","Longitude":"-95.36424","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Date of the Event":"11/30/1991 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
