I have no idea what they are and I am by no means stating that they are UFO's but I know there is a No-Fly Zone over the White House and nearby areas and wondering if anyone knows what these objects could be. Note: These cams are refreshed every 10 to 15 mins so they represent only a moment in time."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-02172011-0003","Longitude":"-77.031806","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder","Date of the Event":"02/13/2011 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
