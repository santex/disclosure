It was a nice evening with some low cloud cover, just beginning to get dark out. I noticed a dark acorn (best shape I can descibe) shaped object in the distance, moving slowly toward the east (toward myself). It had a white light on the bottom that seemed to swivel or rotate. I could not judge the size or altitude, but it was just under the low cloud cover and appeared to be about half the size of the moon from my vantage point and forced perspective. I did not hear any sound. The object moved in a straight path from west to east, and seemed to remain at the same altitude. I watched it until it was overhead (approx. 10 min) and then I decided to go inside my workplace and find another person to see it. When I went back outside, it was no longer visible."],"Region":"Indiana","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-86.153634"}
