{"divs":["sighting details[cms\\tg\\pid] re: ufo?s over the city of torrington to whom it may concern: please find attached a copy of my ufo report and my notes that includes copies of the articles from the newspaper. this information is coming from the northwestern connecticut?s local newspaper the register citizen. the register citizen can be reached at 190 water street, torrington, ct 06790, the main phone (860) 489-3121, fax (860) 489-6790, web site www.registercitizen.com, e-mail editor@registercitizen.com. the editor?s name is jordan fenster and the publisher?s name is matt derienzo. all of the information i am reporting is verifiable. i have seen photos, videos, and spoken to eye witnesses to these unidentified flying objects in the skies. although, i only had a second glimpse one early morning of this object, my wife was able to see it clearly. one report goes back as far as 11\\17\\07. why would someone keep saying the something unless they have seen something odd or strange? it is my sincere hope that a formal investigation on the activity in our area is done. please get back to me with your results as soon as possible. yours truly, ufo?s over torrington 02\\26\\09 register citizen ? sound off. a ufo sighting at 4:30 a.m., while at work, i looked out the window from our seventh floor unit and noticed a bright light. i thought it was a helicopter because the hospital often has patients picked up via life star out of hartford. i noticed it wasn?t moving and it appeared to be swaying just slightly side to side. i immediately called my co-workers to take a look and the security guard, too. we couldn?t tell the shape but it was a bright light which actually dimmed and slowly went out a few times but came on again. my co-workers reported red and green lights at its base and even report seeing a laser like spot moving along the mountain side. we didn?t see this laser directly from the object, but it covered such a large area on the mountain so quickly that it had to come from something of distance. this object just sat there for 1 1\\2 hours. it appeared to move higher as got closer to morning and i didn?t have time to watch where it went because i had to get back to work. i?ve never seen anything like that before, and wow, do i now believe. \" just to let the chh employee know that somebody else saw the same lights the other night.around 9 looking south towards newbury corners and again around 3 or 4 from downtown looking north.not sure what it was,just curious i guess ufo verified wrote on feb 28, 2009 12:21 am: \" the ufo you saw on feb 26 i have ben watching for the past 2 years. i am sure that i saw 2 , one to the east and another to the south at the same time. i also know other people who have seen them. they have ben in the sky over torrington\\winsted area for a long time. could they be military drones? never saw the laser light, but i saw the bright white you could not miss it. \" a ufo in torrington 03\\02\\09 we saw something very unusual in the sky last night over torrington. we were playing with our daughter and cats on our front porch in a fairly secluded section of town and i looked up in the sky and we saw the strangest thing we?d ever seen. we estimate its elevation at between 1,000 to 2,000 feet, but couldn?t really tell. at first i thought it was some sort of bag or box or kite, but it wasn?t. we all saw that it was something that was actually flying, very deliberately, but with a bizarre twist --it was tumbling forward in a uniform, almost deliberate flight path. this was rectangular in shape, and was dark (daughter thought it was black; wife thought it was dark blue). the thing looked like it was a rectangle, but not clearly just a ?box,? and it moved fairly quickly (we saw it at about 80 degrees in the sky and it was over the horizon\\trees in less than a minute). there was no apparent propulsion or stabilizing structure (i.e., wings, tail). it?s hard to say how large it was, but if it was clearly visible at a couple thousand feet, it had to be at least, what, 4 feet long, but we really couldn?t say. it appeared to me that there was a white light that showed whenever one side was revealed during the tumble, however, my wife said she doesn?t remember a light. crazy. i saw a ufo last night 03\\05\\08 i was taking a walk outside my home last night. being a commercial airline pilot with over 30 years experience, i always looked at the sky. but last night i saw a number of orange and red lights approaching from the west. i got my binoculars and called my neighbors to come outside. the object, by this time was a great deal closer and seemed to be right over route 8, just east of the hospital. the lights were shimmering like distortion from engine heat, but i could not hear any sound. the ufo passed over route 8, cars in both the north- and south-bound lanes began pulling over and stopping. the ufo displayed a semi-circular pattern of very bright multicolored lights. five motorists started screaming, as the object became visible, a number of cars lost power and had to pull off the highway. i?m surprised this was not in today?s newspaper. a cover-up i suppose. air traffic control 03\\05\\08 has anyone noticed the increased airplane and helicopter traffic in the west torrington\\goshen area?

none of the people are saying it's a alien craft or a military craft. a ufo just means unidentified flying ojbect which means what people are seeing they don't know what it is. it could be a military experimental craft or maybe a extra terrestrial craft which we will never be able to say because we still don't know for a fact that aliens exist but if some of us want to believe in that sort of thing we have the right to think we are not alone in the universe. we all know the government isn't all that honest anyways not just talking about ufo's. by not saying a word about aliens existing the military can continue to fly their experimental crafts with people trying to figure out what they are seeing in the skies but even if the government was to say aliens exist it would still leave people questioning if they are seeing a et craft or a military craft. people have a hard time with fear in this country and religion both which could be effected if we were to know if aliens do exist. for thousands of years we follow our different religious beliefs. if aliens existed would it change your religious views? if they existed would there be lots of questions you people would ask? questions of fear, technology that could be greater than anything we have? what if aliens existed and some of them were evil? i'm sure those are the types of questions people would be asking if we were to know once and for all if aliens did exist. it's not uncommon for people to have ufo sightings and see helicopters around making it possible it's some sort of military project or for all we know them tracking et crafts. if something goes wrong with a experimental military craft they would need to be nearby to immediately report it keep the area blocked. there was a experimental military craft called the manta. airforce denied the plane existed, could fly at high speeds, was a new plane after the stealth bomber. the public knew the name of the craft, airforce denied it and wouldn't comment, story aired on tv and then the airforce came forward and said the manta was real and existed. good question someone asked, do they appear to be black op helicopters?

newspapers need to increase circulation and their failure to cover a hot topic like this is an injustice to their business and our right to have news brought to us on subjects that are news and are news worthy. when the ufo was reported on 01\\01\\07 over o?hare airport in chicago, the newspaper sold a record number of papers. more people are interested in this topic than the press realizes. we host a weekly local tv show called spiritual and paranormal experiences on cable 5 every tuesday at 5 p.m. we also host a weekly radio internet call in show immediately following our tv program. we are conducting an investigation and will be requesting local, state, federal, and other authorities to conduct a formal investigation on what are the unidentified objects in the sky over the city of torrington. if you have seen these objects and wish to come forward please contact us at on the web [cms\\tg\\pid]. we as a community need to know if the police are investigating this?

[cms\\tg\\pid] said that the idea of the ultra light theory \"is the prattling of idiots\" [cms\\tg\\pid] observed the lights from his home in newtown connecticut at about 9:45 pm. he said that there were at least eight lights of different colors flying very close together and without a sound. as the object passed his home he observed it in a pair of 7 x 35 binoculars. mr. [cms\\tg\\pid] told me that the ufo was one object and he saw some type of heat waves coming from the object which distorted the area around the lights. mr. [cms\\tg\\pid] watched the object with neighbors and his son for over ten minutes as it slowly drifted to the north west. all the witnesses agree that the ufo was one solid object and round in appearance. the [cms\\tg\\pid] party was observing the ufo while it was passing close to i-84. at this time over a dozen cars pulled over to view the ufo as it passed overhead. one witness a charlie tuperman described what happened that night. \"it was about 9:30 or so and i was driving east on 84 around the southbury area when i noticed these lights ahead of me. they were low and it looked like a 747 was going to land on the highway.this thing had about ten lights in kind of a half circle and the lights were yellow, green, blue, white and red. this thing was going very slow and moving from the east to the west. all of a sudden every one on both sides of the road began slamming on their brakes and pulling over to the side. it was a dangerous thing to do since there were several trucks apparently trying the same thing. i pulled over and watched this thing pass directly over the west bound lanes. i saw a dark mass behind the lights and there was no sound. i saw the lights of a state trooper just ahead of me and i figured he was called to see what was going on. then all of a sudden this thing gets real bright, i mean all the lights just got ten times brighter for about ten seconds or so, then they faded to where they were before and that is about as bright as a planes wing lights. that really scared me. i wanted to get going because i thought there was some type of invasion or something,i just wanted to get home. besides i was afraid of some trucker plowing into my car. i watched it head west and lost it . i turned on the radio for news, but didn't hear anything about any ufos on any of the local stations\". close encounter in new milford at about 10:00 after the series of sightings in the i-84 area. the ufo was seen heading to the west. it was then seen in the new milford connecticut area by a robert nellis his friend jeff and mr. nellis dog. they were all in nellis car off a side road off route 7 in the northern area of new milford. they were driving home after a long day of boating upstate along the connecticut river.the dog began to bark and cry and at that point jeff looked over to the northeast to see a number of bright lights hovering over a stand of pine trees less than a quarter mile away. they stopped the car and at that time their car radio began to sound \"funny\" with all types of strange sounding static that interfered with the station that they were listening to. they stopped the car and continued to watch the lights. at this moment the lights began to move slowly towards them. they were amazed at the size of the object, \"larger than a football field\". the dog continued to bark as the object passed over their car . neil looked up and saw a very dark structure connecting the lights that extended toward the rear of the object. he said it was teardrop in shape and the lights in the front were in a half circle.the object was so large he said that\" it covered the sky and blocked out everything overhead\" the object he said was made of some type of \"dark grey material with very little reflect ability\". there was no sound and they estimated that the giant ufo was no more than 500 feet above their car. the ufo then passed over their car and then shifted towards the north. they both noticed some type of flashing lights under the object that gave the impression as if something was moving. they watched the ufo slowly move away. the total duration of the sighting was ten minutes, however both men arrived home forty minutes later. this is could be a case of missing time, or the witnesses observed the object longer than they thought. [cms\\tg\\pid] would call me for several days after my interview with him since he felt \"uneasy and upset\" about his close encounter. my research team and i are still investigating this case and it seems that it may be another of the many missing time cases that are escalating in the area. photographic proof this ufo was so bright and large that it was only a matter of time before someone would come forward with a photograph. to our surprise we were contacted by a person of high standing in the southbury area who took a picture of the object as it moved very slowly over i-84 at about 9:30 pm. the photographer wishes to remain anonymous since his position is very sensitive. he his a very highly trained college educated man who fears that the publicity surrounding the photograph could hurt his career. he gave us full rights to the photograph and his sighting account providing we do not use his real name. we will refer to him as david. (this person was actually [cms\\tg\\pid]; b j) [cms\\tg\\pid] was on i-84 on official business when he saw the lights. the lights were in the northwest and heading east. as he watched, the object tilted and all the lights got much brighter.he was pulled off the road at the time and had his camera ready. the ufo was about 45 degrees above the horizon. due to traffic he had time to take only one picture. his camera was a 35 mm with a 50 mm lens at 1.8, the film type was kodacolor asa 400 and the exposure was 1\\60th of a second, or 1\\125. he was not sure of the setting, but feels it was 1\\60th of a second. the object then moved toward the east without a sound. during an interview with this researcher, [cms\\tg\\pid] told me that the he was sure there was a solid object behind the lights. he also said that when the object turned it looked like the lights on the sides were pulling out from the main mass, but he realized that this effect was due to the object changing position from his point of view. what about the photo: several photo-analysis experts are now looking at the photograph. our initial study showed that the image is without a doubt hanging in the sky above the ground. also the photograph was looked at by [cms\\tg\\pid] a scientists and ufo researcher of some repute. [cms\\tg\\pid] initial calculations show the object to be anywhere from 650-1600 across! we believe that this photograph is one of the best nighttime ufo pictures taken in the past twenty years. there were quite a few witnesses to the sighting over a twenty-five mile radius, all reporting the same thing. a close examination of the original negative shows that the lights are reflecting off of some type of structure in the central part of the object.also the lights are in a perfect half circle. there is no doubt that what ever the ufo photograph represents it is one solid object. we hope to get more data on the photograph and the sightings in the weeks to come. i have taken an add in the local papers asking for videos and photographs and sighting accounts from that night. a rational explanation? what about the theory that the ufo is nothing more than ultra lights from candlewood airport. we questioned state police on this theory. an officer stated that they made a mistake about the airport, it wasn't candlewood but stormville airport. a flight instructor at stormville later told us that there is only one ultra light at stormville and it only flies in the day since it is illegal for them to fly at night. the ufo sightings in the northeast continue. in the days to follow i received several calls from witnesses who saw formations of military helicopters in the sighting area. one witnesses took a picture of this formation. is the government involved in the mysterious happenings over the connecticut area? many of the residents feel that the government is well aware of the ufo and is doing its best to play down the sightings by explaining them away. i called nearby bradley international airport to find out if they had any information about the sightings. i was informed by air traffic control that no formations or large aircraft were tracked on radar at that location and time. i was also told that unless the \"aircraft\" have transponders (a device placed in aircraft that helps identify them on radar) in them they would not be picked up at that location at an altitude of less than 2,000 feet. i have enough witnesses in different locations at the same time observing the ufo to determine that the approximate altitude was between 1,000 and 1300 feet. based on this information my calculations indicate that the span of lights was at least 900 feet! its apparent size in the sky was quite large, this is evident by the image on the 35 mm frame that takes up almost half the negative. it is obvious from the photograph and by the witness statements that something more than ultra light aircraft was in the sky over connecticut that night. \" [cms\\tg\\pid] wrote on mar 6, 2009 10:47 am: \" a few days ago i mentioned that i have seen low flyling helicopters and airplanes over the goshen east st. north area. well i have a update. yesterday i was walking in the woods near my home. i ventured out a little further than i normaly do, and i was greeted by a man in a military uniform that told me i was trespassing and i need to leave. i think there must be some secret government activity going on. could it be due to the ufo activity?

in some ufo sighting cases taking soil samples of where a craft was hovering has been done before because sometimes soil is effected by propulsion of the craft and contaminates the soil in some way. \" ufos and helicopters wrote on mar 9, 2009 12:50 pm: \" here is a link to a article that talks about a ufo sighting in another state back in 2005 and then after the sighting there were helicopters in the area during evening hours. http:\\\\ufoinfo.com\\sightings\\usa\\050508b.shtml \" re ufos and helicopters intersting wrote on mar 9, 2009 1:21 pm: \" wrote \" here is a link to a article that talks about a ufo sighting in another state back in 2005 and then after the sighting there were helicopters in the area during evening hours. http:\\\\ufoinfo.com\\sightings\\usa\\050508b.shtml \" lakeside, california silver colored, elongated shaped object date: may 8, 2005 time: between 9:30 - 10:00 p.m. hbcc ufo research note: lakeside california seems to be a hotbed for ufo sightings over the last while. a number of really unusual objects have been witnessed by a number of lakeside residents. also being reported is military jets and helicopters flying in the area, late in the evening. this was also noted earlier after a major sighting ufoinfo and hbcc ufo research received. hi, brian. on sunday, may 8th between 9:30 - 10:00 p.m., neighbors (names removed) witnessed the following: a silver colored, elongated shaped object moved into the area from the south west. there was a small, round bright light to the left side of it. the objects moved slowly to the east, then westerly direction. it was approximately 100 feet above a cloud and was in close proximity to the north star. it's very cloudy and has been raining lightly here. neighbors have been searching nightly for any unusual objects and i will report for those that don't have access to a computer. there has been an unusual amount of military jets and helicopters flying in the area late in the evening. an acquaintance of mine has offered to set up his audio\\video equipment and i hope to hear from him shortly. he was very interested in my sighting and is eager to see something himself. thank you to the person for sending along this report. brian vike, director hbcc ufo research \" ufo sightings wrote on mar 2, 2009 7:16 pm: ?they say that when you see a ufo sighting in one area, chances are you will see it for a few days or a week, a few weeks, a few months. in other parts of the country there are more ufo sightings going on and people are seeing them more frequently.? recently i watched a program on the history channel and one guy that claims to have worked at area 51 did research on a ufo craft to help with reverse engineering to figure out how they work. the guys name was bob lazar. lazar told one of his friends a date when there was going to be a ufo test flight late at night. they claim the government has figured out how to fly ufo's and they are beginning to figure out how some of the technology works. if that's true then some of the ufo's being seen are military while some out there just might be some sort of other intelligence flying them. after lazar claimed to work at area 51 and told the public that he worked on reverse engineering on ufo crafts he claims his life started to get threatened and people were trying to erase his identity. places he worked out, where he was born, they started denying he ever went to the places or was born in one place. he has been called a liar. he took a lie detector test and passed which means he is a very good pathological liar for being a good hoax maker or he?s telling the truth. the science of the propulsion system to boost the crafts at high speed he claims is called element 115 which is a fuel. they put some of the 115 in a small particle accelerator onboard the saucer and bombard the 115 with a proton. it turns the 115 into 116 witch decays and releases anti matter and a gravity wave. the gravity is then amplified and is directed out underneath the craft. the antimatter reacts with a gas which turns to energy in the form of heat. then it's converted into electricity and they have some sort of generator that the craft uses. they claim the design of the craft and the technology causes time and space to wrap around it, it pulls the time and space around the craft. that causes it to go from point a to point b in seconds. weather or not the story is true or not any of us know. \" ?we saw something very unusual in the sky last night over torrington. we were playing with our daughter and cats on our front porch in a fairly secluded section of town and i looked up in the sky and we saw the strangest thing we'd ever seen. we estimate its elevation at between 1,000 to 2,000 feet, but couldn't really tell. at first i thought it was some sort of bag or box or kite, but it wasn't. we all saw that it was something that was actually flying, very deliberately, but with a bizarre twist--it was *tumbling* forward in a uniform, almost deliberate flight path. it was rectangular in shape, and was dark (daughter thought it was black; wife thought it was dark blue). the thing didn't pitch or roll from side to side randomly; it basically remained within what appeared to be a \"set\" path or corridor of air--not moving in a straight any direction, from southwesterly to northeasterly direction between our house and our neighbor's. the thing looked like it was a rectangle, but not clearly just a \"box,\" and it moved fairly quickly (we saw it at about 80 degrees in the sky and it was over the horizon\\trees in less than a minute). there was no apparent propulsion or stabilizing structure (i.e., wings, tail). it's hard to say how large it was, but if it was clearly visible at a couple thousand feet, it had to be at least, what, 4 feet long, but we really couldn't say. it appeared to me that there was a white light that showed whenever one side was revealed during the tumble; however, my wife said she doesn't remember a light. crazy!!! \" link : http:\\\\www.registercitizen.com\\articles\\2009\\03\\06\\opinion\\doc49b0b6f0ba9c4668081644.txt 03\\06\\09 ufos and the press we have been looking for the ufos and i have not been able to find them in the local papers anyway! we have been searching in all local, state and national media for the ufos over the city of torrington. in the past week, numerous people have been writing in ?sound off ? and posting comments on the web regarding the rash of sightings in the past week. the city is being invaded and the press is not covering the story. why, why, why? newspapers need to increase circulation and their failure to cover a hot topic like this is an injustice to their business and our right to have news brought to us on subjects that are news and are news worthy. when the ufo was reported on 01\\01\\07 over o?hare airport in chicago, the newspapers sold a record number of papers. more people are interested in this topic than the press realizes. we host a weekly local tv show called spiritual and paranormal experiences on cable 5 every tuesday at 5 p.m. we also host a weekly, live, radio internet call in talk show ?the x factor? immediately following our tv program. we are conducting an investigation and will be requesting local, state, federal, and other authorities to conduct a formal investigation on what are the unidentified objects in the sky over the city of torrington. if you have seen these objects and wish to come forward please contact us on the web at [cms\\tg\\pid]. we as a community need to know if the police are investigating these phenomena?
