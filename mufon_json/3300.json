While I was there, too, I was too small to remember it (I was born in 1954). My mother, the woman who usually babysat us, my brother and I were all in our back yard. It was just after dusk and getting dark. My mom and the other lady were dipping apples that had fallen from the tree in the back yard into a sulphur solution to kill the hornets that were feeding inside of them (to this day, that part of the story sounds as bizarre as the UFO part of the story itself!). My brother started crying because a hornet got in his boot and stung him. But just then, a disk shaped object came out of the sky and hovered near us. It had a section in the middle that was made of glass through which could be seen bright flames burning. My mother felt like it was about the distance away as the top of a telephone pole, yet she felt the impulse to just reach up and touch it...it seemed so close. And then the thing shot up straight into the sky at a supernatural speed and disappeared."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Newport","There were no other sightings in Newport on or around February 19th 2005"],"City":"Newport","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3300.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3300.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/19/2005 09:25 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"43.365358","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Not Provided","Date Submitted":"02/19/2005 09:25 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Log Number":"","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.173439"}
