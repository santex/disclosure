{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi it was a night like any other,i stood on my doorstep to have a cigarette at 2.00 am, i looked at the stars like i always do and noticed that one \"star\" appeared to be moving, after letting my eyes adjust i witnessed the star like object split into two but still apeared to be connected by a shaft of light, the objects then moved through the sky erratically before coming to a standstill, the object then repeated the process again and again for hours, through out the sky there were much smaller objects travelling in groups at an incredible speed between the bigger, brighter objects, amongst all this, i noticed two star like objects, with a yellowish glow and a red light, these objects were emitting arcs of light in unison, this continued untill the sky became light, the objects were still there but not very visible due to the sky becoming lighter, my girlfriend was a witness to my initial sighting, we were both stunned to witness this event, i am not usually the kind of person to make a fuss but this was too strange to go unreported, i would appreciate it if this message was acknowledged."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Case Number":"31547","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"huddersfield","Longitude":"-1.726087","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31547.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31547.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/05/2011 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.645766,+-1.726087(31547)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31547) map </A>","Latitude":"53.645766","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United Kingdom","Log Number":"GB-09052011-0007","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"star like craft emitting beams between one another, other smaller craft travelling at incredible speed","Date Submitted":"09/05/2011 06:40 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in huddersfield","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."]}
