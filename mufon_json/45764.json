I didn't think anything of it until I noticed that it wasn't moving. There was a bit of wind so if it had been a bird, kite or something similar it wouldn't be that still. I watched it carefully to see if I could identify it, but it appeared to be morphing shape from having a boomerang type shape to being a saucer, to being a perfect orb. It moved a few times from the SW to the SE direction, each time stopping and hovering perfectly still for a few moments before moving a little more. Suddenly, it dropped straight down a bit then headed off to the East, I ran inside and grabbed binoculars as well as getting my dad to come outside with me. We both observed it hovering again, perfectly still just above the tree-tops (Although it must've been behind them, depth is hard to discern against the sky). I looked through the binoculars to see that the color of the object was cobalt blue and shiny. Like car paint. There were no lights and no sound. Right after observing it through the binoculars, it disappeared completely. This all took around half an hour-ish and I stayed outside about another hour longer, hoping to witness something further but to no avail."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pāpa‘aloa","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"02/18/2013 02:08 UTC","Longitude":"-155.205986","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Latitude":"19.96667","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45764.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45764.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:25:00","Country":"United States","Summary":"Appeared, Changed appearence, cobalt blue, disappeared.","City":"PÃÂpaÃ¢ÂÂaloa","Region":"Hawaii","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.96667,+-155.205986(45764)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45764) map </A>"}
