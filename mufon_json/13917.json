I could not tell the distance away from the car but it was at least 50 miles and was very high in the air. One of the lights was dimmer than the other. The lights were stationary and very noticable. I pointed the lights out to my family in the car with me and they couldn't tell what they were. I asked my Mom if I could grab her cellphone to take a picture but as we rounded the corner the lights dissapeared. As we took the corner I could have sworn that they begain to move. Since I live near Boston I can tell what airplanes look like because the airspace is filled with them. This UFO was WAY too bright to be an airplane. Anyone eles with any information send an e-mail to me at brightlightsoverboston@gmail.com with no CAPs.
