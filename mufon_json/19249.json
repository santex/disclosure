I looked at the object with a pair of simmons field glasses, they are a cheap set but really made a difference.It seemed to hover and was far enough off to make no sound that I could hear. I had seen an object similar to this only one other time and managed to get it on video. It was so far away by the time I got my camera all you can see is an object changing colors almost a flicker.I have seen several things that were strange, Maybe there is an explaination for what I seen, but I can say it was not a helicopter or an airplane. There are no towers over that way at least none that eventually move away.
