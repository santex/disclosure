2011 ��������� my first ufo sighting occurred on this date at 10:25 p.m. est. i was at home in felton, delaware, walking my dogs in my back yard, which was illuminated by 2 flood lights. the sky was clear with no overcast at all. the home, situated on 1 ��������� acres, is located in a small, quiet, rural town in mid-state delaware. the area is heavily wooded on 3 sides. the neighborhood homes are situated on a minimum of 1 ��������� to 10 acres each. across the street is a state park, and 2 schools are located ��������� mile to the west. there is a major 4 lane highway 1 ��������� mile to the west with heavy private and commercial traffic during the day and medium traffic at night. my road carries medium traffic during the day and very light traffic at night. i looked toward the western sky and saw a very bright, white light. i thought it was a large star or a planet. since it didn���������t twinkle, i decided it must be a planet. after 3-5 minutes, i was startled when the object began to move. it moved a short distance to the northeast, at which point, i saw very bright red and white lights on the underside, which appeared to rotate in a circle. the object stopped and hovered in place in complete silence ��������� there was no engine noise at all. the estimated altitude was less than one mile and approximately 1 mile distance. i did not witness its journey to this location ��������� it was there when i looked up. it moved very, very slowly to the right or northeast. then, i noticed 2 secondary objects, also with bright red and white rotating lights, at a much higher altitude, estimated at 10,000 feet. these ���������secondary��������� objects were scattered in a random pattern high and above, flanking the ���������primary���������, one to the south and the other to the north. after hovering silently for approximately 5 minutes, the primary craft began to look smaller, and i realized it was moving upward. it moved slowly upward, until it reached the approximate altitude of the 2 secondary objects ��������� or 6,000 to 10,000 feet. then, it began to move out, toward the northeast at an extremely slow rate of speed, with its red and white rotating lights very bright and visible. i was astounded at what i was witnessing. my heart rate went way up; i found it hard to breathe. i continued to watch the 3 objects. the ���������primary��������� continued to the northeast at an extremely slow rate of speed ��������� estimated at under 50 mph. i decided this was definitely not an airplane, because it was moving at a slower rate than is necessary to maintain fixed wing airspeed. as the ���������primary��������� moved, the 2 secondary objects followed in the same direction, but at a very wide distance behind. it was at this point, i nicknamed them ���������the guardians���������, because that���������s what it appeared they were doing ��������� guarding the ���������primary��������� object. the ���������primary��������� object travelled for approximately 3 minutes and disappeared at the tree line in the northeast. the 2 ���������guardians��������� followed behind, and within 3-5 minutes, also disappeared at the northeastern tree line. afterwards, i did get quite upset and decided i should call someone. i called the local police department, but that was a major mistake. they ridiculed me terribly and began asking very personal questions about my history. a few days later, i decided to phone the national ufo center in washington state. someone returned my call and requested that i send a report. i did file a report, but heard nothing further from the center. i have continued to witness multiple sightings almost every day for nearly one year ��������� from january 4, 2011 to the current date of december 14, 2011. they never appear during the day, and the only evenings they don���������t appear is when the sky is overcast. on some days, i have witnessed up to 5 different sightings at 5 different times in the same day. lately, i���������ve become aware that as i am observing my visitors, my heart rate will increase and i experience some chest pain. when this happens, i explain to ���������them���������, ���������i can���������t do this tonight ��������� i have to go inside���������. i don���������t really know why i think it���������s necessary to explain to them why i���������m leaving ��������� maybe it���������s my upbringing. but, somehow, i do feel they can hear what i���������m saying. i also get the distinct impression that they are ���������performing��������� their tricks just for me. it seems interesting that every time i turn my back yard flood lights on, they are always there ��������� waiting for me to look up. and, i���������ll say to them, ���������oh my god, you���������re already here. or ��������� oh, you are very low tonight. or ��������� you are very bright tonight. or ��������� you are so beautiful. or ��������� oh, you���������re ���������moving out��������� so soon? or, you���������re not in your right place tonight, etc., etc. but mostly out of frustration, and having no one to witness these events, i began asking out loud, ���������who are you?���������, ���������why are you here?���������, ���������are you an angel in a space ship?���������, ���������doesn���������t anyone else see this���������?, and the big question ��������� ���������what are you trying to tell me?��������� i really feel that there is a message in these visitations but, of course, i���������ve gotten no answers. after hundreds of sightings to date, it has become a bit scary to go out to the back yard, because i know they will always be back ��������� night after night. it is, in fact, exciting but traumatic at the same time. many nights i experience heavy breathing and chest pain. i sometimes have to go indoors early because of this problem. as a matter of fact, i���������m experiencing the same symptoms while i���������m writing this report. so, it appears that this situation is more upsetting to me than i even realize. on october 6, 2011, i decided to document these sightings in a log. the contents of this ufo log include date of sighting, number of craft, location in the sky, elevation, distance, speed, actions, etc. the ���������routine��������� as outlined above continued for many months with little change in detail. then, i began to notice some changes in the routine and other details ... 1) the number of ���������guardians��������� would increase or decrease, 2) the number of ���������primary objects��������� would increase, 3) change in location in the sky, 4) change in altitude, 5) change in distance, 6) change in direction of departure, 7) change in brightness of lights, 8) change in speed of ascent. here are some of those incidents: primary ascends at high speed (1st time) 10\\23\\11, 8:50 p.m., est: primary craft seen very low in the west (1\\2 mile) with its extremely bright, white light plus 1 vs. 2 guardians very high at 8,000 to 10,000 feet. i asked out loud, ���������are you an angel in a space ship?��������� the craft immediately went straight up at a high rate of speed. wow. this never happened before. the action of the craft made me believe that they could hear what i was saying and reacted to what i had said. that was absolutely exhilarating. about 5-10 minutes later, the primary came back to its usual westerly position at the normal altitude. i didn���������t see it travel to the location; it just appeared there when i looked back. it seemed to be a way of telling me that i didn���������t scare them off, and they were happy to pick up where they left off. it hovered silently for 1-2 minutes, then headed out to the northeast as usual. 1) 3 events in one night (first time) 2) 3 guardians vs. 2 (first time) 3) 0 guardians, vs. 2 (first time) 10\\30\\11, 7:30 p.m. est: 1 primary in west, normal altitude at 1 mile, 3 guardians vs. 2. 10\\30\\11, 11:30 p.m. est: 1 primary very low in west, altitude about ��������� to ��������� mile, 1 guardian vs. 2. 10\\30\\11, 11:45 p.m. est: 1 primary very low in west, altitude about ��������� to ��������� mile, no guardians vs. 2. primary went solo for the first time. 1) 2 primary craft seen together (first time) 2) 4 primary craft seen in 1 night, 2 events (1st time) 11\\06\\11, 9:10 p.m. est: 2 primary, 1 above the other in west, both low altitude, ��������� to ��������� mile, plus 2 guardians ���������.. amazing to watch. 2 primary craft seen together (second time ��������� same night) 1 guardian vs. 2 (first time) 11\\06\\11, 9:30 p.m. est: 2 primary, 1 above the other in west, both low altitude, ��������� to ��������� mile, plus 1 guardian vs. 2. shocking to see this display in one night. new location further west (1st time) 11\\07\\11, 6:10 p.m. est: 1 primary, at low altitude, ��������� to ��������� mile, . not in usual location ��������� about ��������� mile further to west, plus 2 guardians. . i said out loud, ���������you are in the wrong place ��������� are you visiting others?���������. no reaction. 1) 3 primary craft in one night, 3 events (1st time) 2) short hover time (1st time) 11\\12\\11, 7:10 p.m. est: 1 primary low in west, plus 1 guardian vs. 2, headed n.e. 11\\12\\11, 7:15 p.m. est: 1 primary low in west, plus 2 guardians, headed n.e. 11\\12\\11, 7:30 p.m. est: 1 primary low in west, plus 2 guardians, headed n.e. . hover time for each was 1 minute or less before heading out. 1) 5 primary craft in one night (first time) 2) 5 events in one night (first time) 3) earliest evening sightings (first time) 4) no guardians (first time) 11\\14\\11, 5:15 p.m. est: 1 primary, low west, ��������� mile, to n.e, 0 vs. 2 guardians 11\\14\\11, 5:18 p.m. est: 1 primary, low, ��������� mile, to n.e. in 1 vs. 5 min., 0 vs. 2 guardians 11\\14\\11, 5:22 p.m. est: 1 primary, low, ��������� mile, to n.e. in 1 vs. 5 min., 0 vs. 2 guardians 11\\14\\11, 5:27 p.m. est: 1 primary, low, ��������� mile, to n.e. in 1 vs. 5 min., 0 vs. 2 guardians each primary ���������appeared��������� one right after the other. i still did not see its trip to the westerly location; it just ���������appeared��������� there each time i looked back. took several digital photos ��������� no images were captured. very strange to me. 11\\14\\11, 7:40 p.m. est: 1 primary, low, ��������� mile, to n.e. in 1 vs. 5 min., 1 vs. 2 guardians. on phone with friend; shared my observations with him. new location ��������� east vs. west (2nd time) 11\\17\\11, 5:50 p.m. est: 1 primary, low, ��������� mile, in east vs. west, 1 vs. 2 guardians. ** 1) 23 craft in one night (first time) ** 2) first witness (friend) ** 3) new arrival location ��������� north vs. west (firt time) ** 4) new departure direction ��������� east vs. northeast (first time) ** 5) primary turned off lights (first time) 11\\27\\11, 8:00-8:45 p.m., est: the evening began when i walked to my back yard with my friend, who would be my first witness. i was very excited and hopeful that we would see something. it began almost immediately, as if on cue. one primary, low in the west, ��������� mile with 1 guardian. then we spotted multiple guardians all at once ��������� we counted 12 guardians, scattered throughout the night sky. it was amazing. a few minutes later, we saw 2 primary, low, ��������� mile, in the north vs. west (first time ever), plus 2 guardians. while we were watching the 2 primary craft, one blinked out, turned off his lights. that was a stunner. i had always thought that the primary craft travelled in stealth (no lights) to its location and then, turn on his lights. after seeing this, i���������m convinced that it���������s true. the craft will not allow its witness to see its approach. they will maneuver to their intended location, and then turn on the flood lights. wow ��������� amazing! and, the evening wasn���������t over yet. at this point, we had counted 19 craft total. at approximately 8:45 p.m., my friend had just left for home. i walked out to the west side of my property from the front yard, and there again was one more primary in the west, plus 3 guardians. after hovering for 2-3 minutes, it began to depart, but it headed due east, right over my head (first time ever). i was so stunned that i could hardly breathe. never before did any craft make this departure in an easterly direction. it was always northeast, never due east. all 3 guardians followed the primary in the easterly direction. total craft for the night ��������� 23. amazing. later, i thought that perhaps they knew i was having a friend for dinner, and they decided to put on a huge show or perhaps a grand finale. i mean, seriously? what else would a person conclude? 2 primary craft ascending quickly (1st time) 12\\01\\11, 11:25 p.m. est: no craft in sight. looked toward west 2 minutes later, 2 primary in west ��������� 1 low and 2nd one low and to right but behind the first. #1 primary went very high, very quickly (that���������s new) and then headed out to the northeast. #2 primary took his place, then went high very quickly (like #1) and headed out to the northeast. no guardians at all. primary craft turned lights on (1st time) 12\\11\\11, 6:30 p.m. est: 1 primary already headed to northeast, plus 1 guardian vs. 2. 12\\11\\11, 9:10 p.m. est: 1 primary low (1\\2 mile) plus 1 guardian vs. 2. 12\\11\\11, 9:12 p.m. est: 1 primary blinked on ��������� turned lights on ��������� i was shocked. there it was ��������� what i had suspected for months ��������� confirmation that these craft travel to their preferred location, then turn their lights on. wow. this primary was lower and more northerly. he hovered for over 5 minutes (much longer than normal) and then headed out to the northeast, as usual. no guardians. brighter lights (1st time) 12\\12\\11, 11:10 p.m. est: 1 primary, low, ��������� mile, no guardian. while i watched, he made his lights much, much brighter. it was stunning. it was almost like he was showing off or winking at me. i commented out loud ��������� ���������wow, that was beautiful���������. for some reason, i really think he heard me. he kept his lights at the bright level, then dimmed them and headed to the northeast, as usual. amazing night! new location ��������� south (1st time) 12\\13\\11, 5:50 p.m. est: 1 primary, new position in south. i began to doubt that this was a primary craft, for 3 reasons ��������� 1) it didn���������t move at all, 2) it held this position for over 10 minutes,which was never done before, and 3) this is the first time a primary has appeared in the south. i was beginning to think that this was perhaps the microwave tower, which is nearby, but the light was very white and not blinking at all, which the tower light would do. i waited in the extreme cold for the full 10 minutes, but then i said out loud ��������� ���������ok, if you are a primary, i���������m just too cold ��������� i have to go inside���������. and so, i did go inside. 12\\13\\11, 7:50 p.m. est: the primary that i observed in the south 2 hours earlier was gone. so, apparently this was an actual sighting in a brand new location ��������� in the south. i looked around for other primaries, but there were none. there were 5 guardians, and all headed from the south to the northeast. my conclusions: after almost one year of observations, i have come to a few conclusions ��������� 1) there are a lot more craft out there than the 23 that i observed in one day. 2) i believe that all craft take turns at being a primary craft. at other times, they fill the role of guardian. 3) they prefer not to reveal their approach to their selected position, therefore, they travel in darkness and then turn on the lights when they arrive. 4) they enjoy being creative and entertaining and may even have a sense of humor. 5) as far as understanding their mission or purpose for being here ��������� i���������ll leave that to the experts to discover. i haven���������t a clue. 6) my final conclusion is ��������������������������� they are not from earth."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log
