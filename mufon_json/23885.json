It was dark out but the sun was almost coming up. All of a sudden something in the sky started emmiting a very bright light. The object appeared to be dark surrounded by bright white light. I am not sure how far away it was. Partialy obstructed by some leaves at the top of a tree. The light was turning some of the leaves white. It remained still the whole time. No sound. I was startled enough to grab for my camera but when I did that the light disappeared. Only lasted about 5-8 seconds."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23885.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23885.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Canada","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/21/2010 04:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:00:08","Log Number":"CA-06222010-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"23885","Date Submitted":"06/22/2010 03:50 UTC","Summary":"Bright white glow appeared in sky, Made some leaves at the top of a tree look white.
