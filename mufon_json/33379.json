I was east bound on I-44 nearing the intersection of I-270 and noticed several bright lights (6-10)flying together. At first, I thought they were aircraft approaching Lambert Airport, but then I realized they were to close together. The objects were close together and were in formation. A straight line that tailed off, like a reverse \"J\" shape. I tried to watch and keep my eyes on the road, as best I could. When I turned Northbound on I-270 the lights passed above my car and I lost visual contact at that time. The total time was about 1-2 minutes."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
