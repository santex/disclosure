She said, \"Look at that.\" It looked like a planet and then I noticed the one following it. There were two lights flying at low altitude one in front of the other from the southwest in a steady pattern to the northeast. The front light was bigger than the one trailing behind it. The last light was smaller. There was no noise and the lights did not flash or have any color. I had never seen anything like it before. My wife and I really didn't discuss it until tonight and even though we are sure that someone can explain it (or try) it was very weird. The objects disappeared. I read on this site that someone in Arkansas had a very similar sighting this morning and decided to report what we saw."],"Date of the Event":"11/06/2007 06:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Ashburn","Summary":"two lights flying one behind the other southwest to northeast nonflashing bright big lights","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.706013,+-83.653224(8297)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8297) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-11062007-0010","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Latitude":"31.706013","Date Submitted":"11/06/2007 06:30 UTC","Case Number":"8297","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Ashburn","There were no other sightings in Ashburn on or around November 6th 2007"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like"}
