As I was standing there, I noticed a large collection of flying objects I cannot explain fly in formation over the river. As I got closer to see what exactly it was, one of the spaceships, which looked remarkably like an egg, landed in front of me. To my amazement, I witnessed a large, bean tribal chief step out and engage me in conversation. He said that he, Chief Greasetoe, was the commander of this particular air calvary force, and that this is his warning to me and all of the rest of humanity. He said that our world will succumb to a bean invasion shortly after August of 2012. As he and his spaceship then left, his craft hit the brown note and I defecated upon myself in a rather green and uncolorful brown poo matter. I think that this is the start. Please contact me for any advice or help.
