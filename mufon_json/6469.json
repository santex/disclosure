I gave the officer a brief description of what I saw and she told me to call back if i saw anything else."],"Date of the Event":"02/27/2007 09:40 UTC","Summary":"several long strings of dull lights, like flying wings.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.966253,+-91.824993(6469)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6469) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02282007-0001","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-91.824993","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Missouri","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6469.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6469.html"],"trends":[""],"Latitude":"37.966253"}
