The object was ahitish-blue color and was very bright, much brighter than a planet. It moved in bursts, leaving a trail behind it, stopping and starting as it went across the sky. It flashed four times. I saw a similar thing at 30 degrees off the horizon moving East to West last night and the night before. That one was moving East to West. They were too fast to be a satellite, plane, or helicopter. I just want to know what it was and if anyone else saw it. The size of the object was smaller than an aspirin. Note: The witness and his son saw the Pheonix lights when they lived in Arizona. He states that they were definately not flares."],"Region":"Missouri","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Oak Grove","There were no other sightings in Oak Grove on or around June 14th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06202011-0008","Date of the Event":"06/14/2011 10:05 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Oak Grove","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.007257,+-94.123301(29639)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29639) map </A>","Longitude":"-94.123301"}
