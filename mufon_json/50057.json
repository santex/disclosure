I was facing north and to the west a bright white orb,sphere just appeared. It was real bright thats why i noticed it. No noise came from it when it moved threw the sky about the speed of a plane and was definitely lower in altitude than a plane. It was travel in to the east about 45' in the sky. So I took my camera on my phone and turned the flash to its highest and point it and captured two pictures.then it went out of sight due to horizon. I don't know what it is but I do know I have seen similar thing(s) for the past 2years off and on. I was super excited when I seen it and really excited when I took the pictures. But when I got inside much later and looked at my pictures I was in shock in what was got in both photos. To me I think they are 2 of the best pictures of a UFO I have ever seen and people I show say and believe the same."],"City":"Union","Region":"Oregon","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.20847,+-117.865213(50057)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50057) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-117.865213","Date of the Event":"08/11/2013 10:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-08222013-0006","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Union","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"45.20847","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"50057","Date Submitted":"08/22/2013 06:24 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
