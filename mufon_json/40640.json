{"Latitude":"38.757941","divs":["sighting details on the 4th of july 2012, 4 adults and 2 teenage children were sitting on our back porch talking at 11:05 pm after the holiday celebration, when i noticed a fireball type craft flying in the sky horizontally from southeast to northwest, from ferguson, mo to st. charles, mo or alton, il area. once i pointed it out to the others they all saw it too. it flew slowly and the path it flew was straight, but did vary every so often and go up or down slightly, it flew over us and continued on until it was out of our sight, descending slightly the further it went. the size of the fireball type craft was approximately 1\\8 to ��� the size of the moon as we see it on earth. the craft seemed rather jagged like it was on fire. it didn���t appear to have a shape other than a jagged ball. it was not close to us but was easily visible. the craft made no noise, as the planes etc. we see often in our area do. it was very deep reddish orange. this is the second craft i have seen in this general area. july 4th 1997 i saw a very large craft over hwy 370 near st. charles mo, as did thousands of other fireworks watchers."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Missouri","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-90.331375","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07092012-0022","Object Shape":"Fireball","City":"Florissant","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Florissant","There were no other sightings in Florissant on or around July 4th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40640.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40640.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/09/2012 07:51 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"Fireball St. Louis, MO July 4th 2012","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.757941,+-90.331375(40640)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40640) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 11:05 UTC","Case Number":"40640","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
