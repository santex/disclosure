Yes I���ve experienced abducted which I now term ���Contacts��� with the entity. I have the Instant Message saved to my computer from that night. The instant Message is full of death threats from the hacker so I���m not comfortable with sending the file at this time. After I was done with the conference I had a bad feeling about something and went to open my side door of my room. I looked up in amazement to see something I never thought would be over my house. I saw a hexagon shaped formation of six tiny white lights. It just staid there for about a minute or two and the lights went out one by one. It had to be the same craft I���ve seen and one of my friends had seen. Me and my friends feel this hexagon craft is dangerous because of other contacts with similar objects. We think its 500 feet wide and about 200 tall. It���s very reflective and appears only because it has lights. After I saw the last light vanish I stared at the same stop for another few minutes to make sure it wasn���t still there. I didn���t get pictures this time but I do have old ones of the same craft that are much better than what I would have gotten if I did take pictures."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07152007-0003","Disposition":"Hoax","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7443.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7443_submitter_file1__BigScary4.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7443_submitter_file2__BigScary7.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7443_submitter_file3__BigScary13.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7443.html"],"Summary":"The object which is becoming familiar became visible out of nowhere."}
