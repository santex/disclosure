My wife mentioned that they are planets. They were slightly different in brightness, one on the left brighter, a little brighter than what Saturn would be, but not as bright as venus. the other a little less bright similar to Mar's color but brighter. after looking at them for a minute or two the one on the right started to dim as if getting farther away, just before it was gone the other did the same and vanished. Balloons? slim chance but all agreed that \"not hardly\" airplane, \"no way!\" This happened right at 8:00 Just before MacBeth came on Channel 5."],"City":"Belen","Latitude":"34.662837","Case Number":"25724","Date of the Event":"10/06/2010 08:01 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown"}
