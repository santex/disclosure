The sun was just below the horizon. I was scanning the sky for Venus but could not find it. Then, I spotted a bright light in the sky alomost directly overhead. I thought that it was Venus at first, but then the object began to dart around in short bursts. It changed direction several times and moved extremely fast. It appeared to be very high in the sky. Then, it just seemed to fade away. It moved in a way that reminded me of when I would shine a flashlight on the wall to tease my cat."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.502005","Date Submitted":"08/21/2008 06:25 UTC","Longitude":"-81.687759","Case Number":"12178"}
