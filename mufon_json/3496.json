At that time I witnessed an UFO which I reported to you Guys upon returning home !! When I also walked over for smokes in the wee hours of Wednesday and Friday mornings , it was gone !! I just came back from buying 3 packs at Hess and it's back !! The other time I saw this it moved swiftly South to a direct line with Chapel Street , in mere seconds , hovered , did a very tight U-Turn and returned to where it had been hovering previously just as rapidly and all silently !! This time it expressed no such interest in me, if interest that was , however, it did react to my presence seemingly !! I had been watching a 2 hour segment on Asteroids , Comets ,Meteors , Meterorites and Impact Craters on The History Channel and ran out of cigarettes !! I might have previously mentioned my interest in this topic !! About 5 minutes before 2:00 am I left to walk down to the local Hess Station on North Main Street to pick up 3 packs of smokes !! I looked over my shoulder and the same UFO , flashing or strobing red and green lights alternating with a bright blue light , in that same repeat pattern was hovering in the same position , at North - North-West and at about the same height !! There was quite a bit of cloud cover in that region of the sky obscuring all else !! I would take this to mean that I had been correct in my assessment that it was at about the height of your typical jetliner and below the cloud cover !! Other stars and the moon were visible elsewhere in the sky !! In this particular region of the sky , the UFO was alone as nothing else was visible !! I walked down to Hess and picked up my smokes , my receipt is time-stamped at 2:06 am . I spoke with the cashier for a few moments and started walking home !! The UFO was still silently hovering at its' former location . When I got to the rear of my apartment building it still had not moved !! I decided to walk around the side to the front , near I would normally put out the trash for the weekly pickup !! In those few seconds , it silently and speedily moved a few degrees westward to North-West and resumed to hover silently !! The building hid the UFO from my line of sight as I walked around to the front , however that took no longer than a few seconds !! It seemingly reacted to my presence by changing its' station to that new North-West bearing !! Nothing else was visible in this region as the slight cloud cover was still obscuring all else , ergo , it maintained this altitude and remained below the cloud cover !! Having satisfied myself that it had returned , that it seemed larger than your typical jetliner , hovered silently , moved swifter than anything I have previously encountered in the way of aviation , was at the height of your typical jetliner , that it was not a jet , not a jetliner , had no wings and no tail assembly , was not a blimp , was not a balloon and was not a helicopter , I returned to my apartment as I was missing the gem shows on QVC , I am a gem collector and wanted to see what they were offering !! Once again , this seemed to be black in colour , flashed the same lights in the same repeat patterns , and was circular in shape with a slight doming to the bottom and top !! According to Our Government , what I have now recently witnessed twice does not exist !!!!! My reaction might best be described as picque with Our Government !! During the 90's these type of objects were visible over Manchester , N.H. , the Monadnock Region and later , a few years ago , over The Lakes Region !! Over Manchester, during that time frame I reported viewing the typical \"saucer\" shape hovering silently over the local Federal Bldg. to Dan of Sen. Gregg's office !! On another night walking back from the east side Vista grocery store , during the fall , I saw 5 glowing orbs in a \"vee\" formation flying towards the North - North - East during a Friday night highschool footbal game at Gill Stadium !! During that time of the year , Birds and waterfowl should have been heading South !! On a third occasion I saw the triangular shaped craft which bore no resemblence to the Stealth Bomber or the Stealth Fighter !! I reported these sightings to Dan at Sen. Gregg's office and trusted them to follow up on them as I had no idea to whom such reports should or could be made !! Trusting Dan , I kept no records individually !! I now rather doubt if they even bothered to follow up on my reports !! As it has been quite some time since those sightings , I thought they were quite done with our part of the country !! I say \"they\" because quite obviously some intelligence is behind the design , manufacture , and purpose along with the navigation of these vehicles which bear not even the remotest resemblence to anything built by Boeing and Lockeed Martin etc.!! Not even Dornier nor Airbus can lay claim to credit for these crafts !! I have only just realised that this craft in relation to a star , as it was closer, was substanstually larger than a star would appear !! That has only now just occured to me !!"],"Log Number":"US-06262005-0003","Date of the Event":"06/26/2005 02:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.212797,+-71.532912(3496)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3496) map </A>","City":"Concord","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3496.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3496.html"],"Summary":"I saw the same UFO as I had seen the other night which would have been about 3 or so in the morning ofTtuesday morning .","Region":"New Hampshire","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Concord","There were no other sightings in Concord on or around June 26th 2005"],"Object Features":"Dome","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Longitude":"-71.532912"}
