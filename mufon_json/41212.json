They appeared to be floating but moving. I was sitting on my pool deck,having my coffee and petting my dog and looking out and up. Thats when I saw them. I was so shocked, I could'nt believe what I was seeing. I observed them and realized what I was looking at. I knew right away what it was, because I saw them on U.F. O. shows. I ran in the house and got my binoculars and ran back out and looked at them more closely, WOW! AMAZING!I think I could see them because of the sun hitting them,then they whent out of view as they moved in a south to southwest direction. I looked up images of ufo fleets on google, thats exactly what I saw this morning.WOW! Somthing I will never forget and I will never stop looking to see them again."],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in New Lenox","There were no other sightings in New Lenox on or around July 28th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41212.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41212.html"],"Log Number":"US-07282012-0017","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/28/2012 10:30 UTC"}
