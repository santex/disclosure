At the time I was working as a nurse at the federsl prison in Florence approx. an hours drive from home. I had worked late and was coming home at approx. 1 AM. About 5 miles after turning onto Indian 15 I went through a small canyon. Upon exiting the canyon I saw 10 circular lights in the east. They looked somewhat like the ball flares that are used by the military, but they manovered in a way that ball flares cannot. They zig-zaged , joined in a circle and moved like a snake. I stopped the car and got out to get a better view, and watched the manovers for approx 5 minutes. I then heard a \"whooshing \" sound and looked to my left. I then saw a red light scanning the desert floor around the mountain. I looked to my right and saw the shadow of what looked like a blackhawk helicopter coming around the mountain. It also had a red laser looking light scanning the desert. My husband is a former Marine and I know what a blackhawk looks like, I got into my car and went home. It was almost 3 AM when I arrived home which was about 2 hours longer than normal. I only stopped for about 5 minutes and I was only 20 minutes from home What Happened?"],"trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21208.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21208.html"]}
