It wasn't moving and appeared to be about 3 or 4 miles west of my location (I-35 and E Riverside Dr) and a few hundred feet above the ground. The light was glimmering like a star but was obviously much closer. It appeared very white. So white that the glimmering showed various color hues as it shone. About 5 minutes later it started to move what seemed like away from me and also north. The light did not dim or strengthen as it moved. It was moving much slower than an airplane would, maybe about as fast as a helicopter (which is my best guess concerning it's identity). It disappeared behind my apartment building and my apartment is on the 5th floor. When it disappeared it seemed to be over downtown. This really spooked me as I have never seen anything like it before and I know what aircraft look like."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.274583,+-97.734711(24871)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24871) map </A>","Summary":"Brighter than star, about as bright as strong flare","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"30.274583","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"24871","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24871.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24871.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"07/31/2010 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-97.734711","City":"Austin","Log Number":"US-08012010-0001","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"08/01/2010 12:39 UTC"}
