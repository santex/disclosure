The object is stationary, very bright and \"flickering\". It's changing colors fromblue to green to red to white. It's very distant and I'm viewing it through a newtonian telescope. It's been there roughly 15 minutes without motion. It's distance won't let me get a clear outline as to it's shape. The closest I could discern is some kind of irregular triangular shape. It's not a star!"],"trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Salem","There were no other sightings in Salem on or around January 2nd 2011"]}
