More sightings also..","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on a tennis court at night working out on my back looking up at the sky. The first object was four orange see through balls moving through the sky flying low at very high speeds. The second was a single object that was smaller with a small orange light that was only visible, it would disappear and reappear in circles and further distances. The last was a green see through object that was very high up and it was moving fast through the sky. I knew immediately it was an UFO, all the sightings occurred within 10 min of each other. I'm on a military base so they could be monitoring us is my opinion. The activity was really high and in sure if I sit out there every night I could catch something out of the normal. I lost sighting of it in a couple of seconds, all of them moved from on point in the sky to the other in less than 5 seconds. Way faster than a F18 jet."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43804.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43804.html"],"Latitude":"30.188268","Date of the Event":"11/09/2012 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"43804","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.188268,+-85.75908(43804)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43804) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Triangle","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11092012-0019","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Panama City","There were no other sightings in Panama City on or around November 9th 2012"]}
