{"Date of the Event":"08/22/2009 02:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting Details1. Downtown Kansas City, MO watching Annual Air Show. 2. Watching fighter jet during show, looking up and noticed star-like objects. 3. Star, plane, etc. 4. There were 9 objects that I could see. They were spaced out but within close proximity to each other. They weren't moving or flying like a plane or satellite would. Then some would disappear. Eventually there were 3 then one. They just disappeared. 5. I was very curious and excited when I saw the objects. A crowd of 10+ were all looking at them. I'm sure many more people saw them. All I had was my phone and it wouldn't have been able to pick them up through the camera because they were so high and small. I saw commercial jets fly by and I knew that they were not planes. Nor satellites because they didn't really move. 6. A few at a time, they would just disappear. Eventually, it was down to 3. When I lost all of them I walked away then looked up and saw one by itself. Then it disappeared."],"trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 3 other sightings in Kansas City on or around August 22nd 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.107626","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18820.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18820.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Missouri","Date Submitted":"08/22/2009 02:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.107626,+-94.576217(18820)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18820) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"KC Air Show UFO sighting.","Tags":"City","Case Number":"18820","City":"Kansas City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08222009-0020","Longitude":"-94.576217"}
