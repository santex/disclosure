Rice Park. I'm not sure of the exact time and date because it happened in 1997. I think it was July or August. The time was around 9pm-10pm. I was at the park with friends waiting for more friends to arrive. My friends and I just happened to noticed 3 lights in the sky in a shape of a triangle. All it did was hover. It was northeast from where I was, east of Midway Airport. so it had to be in Chicago. Back at the time I figured they were 3 separate lights but now from what I hear from other sightings it could have been a single craft. It had to be hovering for 5 or 10 minutes before more friends arrived and we left and went about our business. I wish, now, that I would have stayed and watched it longer to see how it left or what it did. I also wish one of us had a camera, like today everyone has a camera on their phones."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.754502,+-87.763418(50759)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50759) map </A>"}
