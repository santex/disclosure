{"Summary":"Light that looked like street light then slowly moved away","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and I were riding our bicycles in the evening and my son noticed a light hovering over an open field. I noticed there was no pole indicating this was a street light. We stood right under it for about 3 minutes then it slowly moved away. We looked for anything attached to the light but could see nothing but what looked like a street lamp. My son and I looked at each other and didnt know what to think."],"Date of the Event":"08/16/1989 07:30 UTC","Latitude":"42.075106","Longitude":"-72.03339","Log Number":"US-08012005-0006","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.075106,+-72.03339(3650)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3650) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3650.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3650.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Southbridge","Region":"Massachusetts","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date Submitted":"08/16/1989 07:30 UTC","Case Number":"3650","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Southbridge","There were no other sightings in Southbridge on or around August 16th 1989"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Cylinder"}
