I parked and exited my vehicle and walked to the street to get a better look, but the object had vanished. Several neighbors were also outside looking in the same direction. I did not ask if anyone else had seen the object. The event took place just before 7:00 pm on December 3, 2011. I was returning from the grocery. As I turned the corner I spotted the lights. They seemed to be out of place. The area is well lit and the service station is brightly lit at night. The lights were motionless above the station and were gone by the time I got out of my vehicle."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33810.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33810.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.326074","Object Shape":"Chevron","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.487223,+-84.326074(33810)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33810) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Witnessed lights while driving.
