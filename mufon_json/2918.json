I was reading a book when my fathercalled me to the kitchen and said theres something strange outside and he wantsme to see it. I looked out and noticed 6 bright, square points being a part of abigger object only its shape was noticeable, hence it looked like a saucer. Theobject was flying round an eclipse, then wobbling. My father said he saw itstopped and hovered above trees and bright white light was emitted from it,touching these trees. After ca. 10 minutes the object disappeared, but itappeared again at 23.50. Behaved in the same way, and again disappeared. At24.18 it appeared above the only church in the village changing its positionfrom east to south. It was moving southeastwards, from above the church tointerior of the village ca. 400 metres track - it lasted over 30 minutes, and soon but I went to sleep. I had some problems with falling asleep and I could seethe object from my bed. I dont remember as I fell asleep, but I think ithappened suddenly.
