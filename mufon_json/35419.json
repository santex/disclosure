I looked up in the sky and saw a very bright light. I thought to myself that was a bight light then noticed it wasnt moving. So then I was think it must be on top of a tower. Then the closer I got I kept looking for the tower and realize there no tower. I look back up at the light and it changes shape. The bottom part went ito a point like a diamond the top stayed round. Then on each side a small round spark shot out slowly at a arch. I was going to pull over to try to record it on my phone but there was a card behind me. So I went up a little bit and turned around on a side road. It took 10-20 sec. When I got turned around looked up in the area it was and it was gone."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/01/2012 08:00 UTC"}
