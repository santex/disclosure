Suddenly the ufo came over our house. Our backs were facing the house, so we were surprised when we saw it because we did not hear anything. We had just seen an airplane before we saw the ufo. The plane was much higher and left a vapor trail. This thing seemed much closer. We could look almost directly under it. No wings, no tail. It was aluminum colored and seemed to have a dark band of color about halfway on the body. Though the shape was cigar shaped it sometimes seemed to almost be elongated peanut shaped. We observed it moving at a moderate pace until it went out of sight and then it was back suddenly, like instantaneously, then traveled west, the same route that the plane we saw earlier traveled. The ufo left no vapor trail. When I first saw this thing I knew it was no plane. I was constantly wondering \"what is this\"?"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48993.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48993.html"],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Cigar","Latitude":"36.393664","Longitude":"-86.776157","Tags":"City","Summary":"traveled n-s went out of sight then back suddenly and traveled w.daytime.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.393664,+-86.776157(48993)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48993) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
