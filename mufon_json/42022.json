My first thought was, \"these are so well defined I imagine that a rocket would look very similar\" The lights were close enough to tell they were solid but not close enough to see any defining marks. It wasn't long before I knew they were not rockets or anything I could identify because one began moving erratically. While 2 of the lights seem to move very fast upwards and then decelerate to a slow pace the third object made drastic changes in direction. Seeing the lights I called my wife from the house to see them. We stood together and watch the lights progress from aproximately 30 degrees from ground to 60 degrees. The objects passed above the clouds but were still faintly visable. Eventually 2 of the objects became too high and blocked by clouds to see. The third object (and I am unsure if it is the same object that moved erratically) decended very quickly out of our view. I also noticed a spot light that was shining on the clouds in a different part of the sky. I have often seen this but not above my house. My wife and I also heard an eerie mechanical sound coming from near the highway in the opposite direction. I think this is also unrelated. I mention the spot light and noise because they were not something I would typically see or hear at night."],"Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.600166,+-80.446353(42022)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42022) map </A>","Summary":"3 bright orange lights moving independently, @ various speeds, & direction","Longitude":"-80.446353","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Shape":"Circle, Teardrop","Date of the Event":"08/25/2012 11:04 UTC","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42022.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42022.html"],"Case Number":"42022","Log Number":"US-08262012-0001"}
