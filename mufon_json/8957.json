As we walked out to the car I noticed a bright orange object just above the trees to the east. It was in the same area of the sky as Mars but was much brighter and was moving away from us. At first I thought it was a meteorite burning up in the atmosphere. I quickly realized that it was moving too slowly to be a meteorite so I stopped and took a good look at it. It was kind of square in shape at the top and the light faded away towards the bottom. (I���ve included an image that I created with Photoshop.) It almost looked like the glow of a jet engine from a side view. I can assure you that it was not a jet engine as there was absolutely no noise. I live near NAS Oceana Air Base and know what jet noise is. The object was starting to disappear behind the trees so we got in the car and headed toward our destination. Once we were out of the neighborhood, we could once again see the object. It was much further away and only appeared as a bright point of light. As we kept an eye on it I saw a smaller light slowly descend from the object. As the smaller object descended below the tree line, the larger object pulsated a few times then vanished. I've been reading other UFO reports since this occured and was amazed by the similarities in some of them. It seems rather common to see a smaller object descend followed by the primary object pulsating and disappearing. I can���t help but wonder what these things are dropping off???"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01162008-0043","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-75.976525","Date of the Event":"12/10/2007 07:21 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright orange object flying silently over Virginia Beach.
