i can't see any thing out of them. so i yell out these aren't my binocs and tell my wife to keep and eye on the triangle while i go find my 10x50 binochs. so by the time that i retrieved my binocs and get back to view the craft 5 minutes have had to pass. but low and behold the triangle is still right there still just sitting there totally still. so now i view this thing through the binoculars. it���s big and black with a white light at one point , a red light at another point, and a green light at the third point. it also had a very peculiar red light that seemed to be spinning at the center of the craft. at one point the light seemed to shine into my binoculars and flash across my eyes kind of like a flash from a camera. my wife said that she saw a beam of light come out from the craft. we observed this thing for approximately 15 more minutes it was sweeping left to right and right to left all the while heading east. moving very slow and steadily. by the way there is a small farm due east of our house that is the location that the craft seemed to be hovering over. the farm is called fox chase farm in philadelphia. it is a two minute drive by car from my home. i estimated this thing from the distance; i observed to be 300 feet long by 200 feet at the widest part of the triangle. hovering at 200 or 300 feet over the trees. but that is really anybody���s guess. i know one thing that it was real and i want to see it again. however i was watching your program on the discovery channel last night. you featured the sightings that have been reported in bucks county pa. i was particularly interested in the description of the ufo made by the gentlemen last night. he described a kind of craft that was kind of like a pie. that he could see through the gaps in the craft when the heat lighting was illuminating the craft. well i thought this is where the triangle came from. it looks like the black triangle could separate from that pie ship. it���s just an idea that popped into my head and it is really why i decided to tell you my story. since bucks county is the next county over from montgomery county. who knows maybe our story may help you figure this thing out."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14042.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14042.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/14/2008 07:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-11252008-0048","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome, Other","Summary":"Black triangle over neighborhood seen hovering,moving slow , and darting fast.","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Case Number":"14042","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There was one other sighting in Philadelphia on or around October 14th 2008"]}
