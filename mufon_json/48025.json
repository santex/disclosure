We all looked up and saw what appeared to be a glowing red fireball floating accross the sky heading in our direction to pass above us. It was moving slowly and not making a sound.... it moved over us and disappeared over the tree tops... then came another and then 2 more after following the same path. They left a slight trail behind them and one appeared to zigzag and then come back into the straight line path. They were spotted by another camper down the hill also. These were not planes, not helicopters, not meteorites, not ball lightning, not flares, not Chinese lanterns and not swamp gas... they were deliberate moving glowing objects that flew directly over our heads. The whole thing lasted about 5 minutes and we were so stunned that no one thought to snap a picture or video. These things were so stealth that had the other camper not made us aware we would not have seen them. I believe he stated there were 12 in all that he observed."]}
