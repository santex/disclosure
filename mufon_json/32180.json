At first I thought it was an airplane or satellite, but then I noticed it was moving way to fast as it went from one end of the horizon to the other in a matter of about 3-5 minutes. What was strange about it is that it was changing direction by about 5-20 degrees at a time and was moving at changing speeds, like a swimmer doing a breast stroke, moving fast then slowing down, then moving fast again. I noticed that my roommate was in the kitchen so I went and got him and he witnessed it too. Eventually it went out of sight beyond the horizon."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/29/2011 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32180.html"]}
