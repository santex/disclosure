At first, I thought it was just the usual air-traffic going in and out of DFW Airport and Love Field in downtown Dallas or maybe traffic helicopters, but this did not resemble any of those. These lights were enormous compared to the usual air-traffic and had very well defined edges, no halos. I watched for it to emerge again as I drove to the west and around to the north side of the landfill, but I didn't observe it again. Had it been everyday air-traffic, I would have surely seen it again as I circled the landfill site. So, I am just bewildered as to what it could have been."]}
