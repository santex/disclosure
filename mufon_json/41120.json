It caught my attention because nothing in that part of the sky was that bright before, and because the light appeared in a region of the sky I was familiar with. (I routinely observe the stars and lights in the sky as I travel east to work) Looked up and immediately afterward, and during the course of about 10 seconds, it slowly faded away. I never saw the light move or make any sound. At the time I thought maybe it could be a supernova, but after reading into the subject, it would be impossible."],"Latitude":"38.959125","Date Submitted":"07/24/2012 08:32 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
