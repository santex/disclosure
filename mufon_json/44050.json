We continued to observe the object as we traveled Hwy 118 south to Hwy 111. It was also witnessed by my husband and children. The object appeared to be moving very slowly, maybe even hovering, although it was hard to tell because we were moving as well. We thought it might have been a comet, but after a few moments, we thought it wasn't moving fast enough. We lost sight of it shortly after exiting onto the 111."],"City":"Dartmouth","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"44.665206"}
