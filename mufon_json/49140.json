I Went out for a smoke on the north side of the building and movement in the sky to my right caught my attention. I initial began to filter (within seconds) what my natural interpretation of the object was. Plane, Helicopter etc. and could draw no obvious explanation. The object was silent, drifted north to south. It was triangle in shape. I could see a full solute of the object. It was near black color, stood out from the night sky (object was a lighter shade of black). It had clearly defined edges. I recall a point of light on each three points of the triangle, soft orange with a constant soft glow. My thoughts were clear that given the proximity, altitude and silence it could not be readily identified as an typical flying object. Today I still have difficulty compiling a rational expiation to explain it as conventional aircraft other than a very oddly shape blimp of some kind. During the sighting I felt calm and confused. I don���t recall even telling my friends when I went back into the apartment. I observed the object until I lost sight of it behind the three story apartment complex. The duration of the observation was approximately 15-30 seconds."],"Latitude":"32.160845","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.905943","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49140.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49140.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.160845,+-82.905943(49140)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49140) map </A>","Case Number":"49140","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Region":"Georgia"}
