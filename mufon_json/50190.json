It was completely quiet that night. I DID see and hear a jet elsewhere in the sky, flying at 30,000 feet. These were orange objects about 8 times brighter than Venus in the night sky. They started south of us on the horizon, and they came fast. Then they would start and stop a few times then head off west, fading away. At some times, one was heading west while another one was starting off at the south--so they were not a single object. The whole process from south to west took about 5 minutes. Two separate times, a light dropped from the object and tapered off like a firework. We got binoculars out to look, but as clear as we made the binoculars, we couldn't make out any clear detail."],"Date of the Event":"08/23/2013 09:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Case Number":"50190","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"08/26/2013 04:19 UTC","Object Shape":"Chevron, Egg","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cross Village","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50190.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50190.html"]}
