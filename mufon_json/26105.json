They were very bright with one slighty lower and to the right of the other. I thought wow I don't remember those 2 stars in the sky before. By the time I got to the side of my house, which is about a 100 foot walk, they were gone. I thought maybe a cloud had blocked them so I went back to the alley and they were still not in the sky. There are no clouds around to block them out."],"Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"10/25/2010 08:01 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Washington Court House","There were no other sightings in Washington Court House on or around October 25th 2010"],"Tags":"City"}
