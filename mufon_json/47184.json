{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the golf course, spotted one hovering orb that began to move left to right and was hovering, disappeared for a second, then appeared left to it's original position with another orb and was also moving in different directions. We looked at birds in the sky, planes, nothing looked the same. It was incredible, it just disappeared in the daytime sky afterwards, we were too shocked and transfixed on the object to record it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47184.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47184.html"],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Oakville","There were no other sightings in Oakville on or around May 5th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Two orbs changing direction and hovering in daytime sky","Case Number":"47184","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-79.724968","Date of the Event":"05/05/2013 01:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Log Number":"CA-05052013-0012","Region":"Ontario","Tags":"City","Latitude":"43.394933","Date Submitted":"05/05/2013 04:58 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.394933,+-79.724968(47184)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47184) map </A>","City":"Oakville"}
