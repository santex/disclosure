He couldn't believe what he was seeing. since i have seen them before just in the same place and always keep looking up having the feeling I am going to see them again. after about 10 minutes they desapeared. When back inside and talk about it. I get the sensation that they want us to see them and get used to them, so when they show themselves, we are not so afraid of them."],"City":"Orange","Date of the Event":"04/19/2010 05:30 UTC","Case Number":"22902","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.790204,+-117.844862(22902)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22902) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/20/2010 02:46 UTC","Longitude":"-117.844862","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22902.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22902.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Tags":"City","Summary":"2 white orbs moving side by side.","Latitude":"33.790204","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Orange","There were no other sightings in Orange on or around April 19th 2010"]}
