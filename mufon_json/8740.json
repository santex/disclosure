As I stood in my back yard (with my dog - out for walkies) looking at the stars to the south, four bright, fast-moving white-blue lights in a delta shape (two lights evenly spaced - 2 ft. apart at arm's distance - on each side) appeared in the sky at about a 45 degree angle, flashed briefly, moved north, flashed again, and repeated this pattern about 5-6 times as they moved to the north overhead. There was no noise, and no reflection...then they disappeared. Duration of event was approx. 30 seconds. The lights were about as big as those of a streetlight - but far higher in the sky. (they were the size of a thumbnail at arm's distance). This object was completely foreign to me; the closest thing I could compare it to would be the lights on the underside of an airplane - however there was no engine noise, no jet trail, it was lower than any plane would fly and this is nothing like I've EVER seen before."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
