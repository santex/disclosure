Its was coming from northwest going to the southeast.At first I thought it was a plane because it was about size of it and flying the same speed as many other planes that fly over the house daily. But this object it was brite orange with no blinking lights and no sound. I grab my night scope and look at the object,it was one solid ball of light. Now when you look at a airplane(night time) though the night scope you can allways see the flashing strobe lights and the outline of the airplane, this time I didn't. Describe my feelings...I thought it was cool.and I guess I don't need night vision scope to see UFO's :)"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.127527,+-73.400457(22206)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22206) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/06/2010 08:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-03072010-0024","Summary":"orange oval craft","Latitude":"41.127527","Date Submitted":"03/07/2010 06:41 UTC","City":"Norwalk","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Norwalk","There were no other sightings in Norwalk on or around March 6th 2010"],"Case Number":"22206","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22206.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22206.html"]}
