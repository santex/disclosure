We were pulling slowly into our house street and as we got out we noticed a bright orange glowing light in a starlight shape which ascended in straight line upwards. It shown brightly, remained stationary, not moving and then slowly moved up, then the light just faded. This took about 2 minutes. I can say this was not fireworks - we know the difference. My daughter took a picture from her phone (hope to download later). My older daughter and fianc���e were close behind in their car and also saw the light. We are mostly ex-military so we can confirm it didn't behave like a plane or helicopter. About 10 minutes later we heard a helicopter overhead. Did anyone else see this?"],"Latitude":"25.863436","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Miami Shores","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 11:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"WE saw a bright orange orb shining brightly then ascend and fade.","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-80.197496","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"48663"}
