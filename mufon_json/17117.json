The witness was at home sitting on the front porch of his house which he usually does often to look at the night sky for aircraft coming and going between the nearby airport and military base. At 22:18 he noticed what at first he thought was a bright star in the eastern sky. The witness then noticed that the light was not a star, but a moving object. The color of the object was the same color of a white colored star in the sky, but with no twinkling or strobe effect visible from the object, as it was just a continuous solid light. The witness described the size of the object to be about the size of a bright star in the night sky. The object was described by the witness as moving very slowly and parallel to the ground. After the witness observed this object moving southward for several seconds, the object immediately and with no change in heading or elevation had dimmed in magnitude of brightness down to about the size of a really distant star in the night sky. (See attached sketch drawn by witness and photo taken by me at the location.) The witness stated that the object was visible about half of the way down from the zenith of the sky. The object continued to travel southward with no further change in brightness for about a minute to a minute and a half. The object remained visible until the light of a streetlight in front of the witness��� home to his right had started to obscure the object and then it had become invisible from the light pollution after that. The witness stated that this was not a shooting star, satellite or any type of aircraft which he was familiar with, as he was in the US Air Force for eight years and has been interested in aviation since he was very young."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.856439,+-76.281883(17117)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17117) map </A>","Longitude":"-76.281883","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Norfolk","There were no other sightings in Norfolk on or around May 11th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-05242009-0017","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17117.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17117.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/11/2009 10:18 UTC"}
