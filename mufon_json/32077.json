Straits Highway. I was passing through the town of Topinabee when I saw strange lights just above the treetops, ahead and to my left. I slowed then stopped to get a better look. I saw a dull looking metallic object with a rectangular shape. It had 8 blueish-white lights arranged in 2 rows. It also had 1 dominant red light at the front of one of the long sides. It just hovered above the trees, no movement, no sound. After observing this for a short time I became scared when I realized that this object was not any type of conventional craft. I drove away at a higher than normal rate of speed and lost sight of the object. The next day as I drove to work during the day, I looked for the object or anything it could have been. I saw no lights, no buildings, only trees. Nothing that could explain what I saw."],"Case Number":"32077"}
