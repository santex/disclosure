{"Tags":"City","City":"Washington","divs":["sighting detailsthis occured the cloudy morning after that meteor, streaked across the nightsky of jersey(joisy in local terms)shaking up a crowd at a football game even. finally hit in upprt new york, i believe.since the rain had stopped; i descided to roll(wheelchair traveler)down the street, a short two blocks, to the 7-11. to get a couple things i needed for breakfast, and maybe scratch a couple tickets for quick cash?(wishful thinking). as i turned to backup their steap ramp, to their doorlevel sidewalk, i noticed something strange, up in the sky in a gap between the clouds to the east. a nice lasy had pulled in,and parked. she walked around her car and asked if there was anything wrong?,i said i hope not, pointing to thegiant roll of \"lifesavers\",hhanging about a thousand feet,or so, over the potomac river to the east!.several more people had gathered around; wondering what we were staring at, in the partlycloudy earlymorning sky, none had any idea what it was either. one man suggested that maybe \"marshal hall amusement park\", on the maryland side of the potomac,might be using a balloon to their finsl \"fallfest activities\", before they closed for the winter. when i pointed out that it would be in the \"landing approach area for national airport\", the idea of a \"tethered ad ballon\" was eliminated quickly. later,absolutely, as a 727 heading into national,to land,flew under this stack(the plane's tailfin reflecting the morningsun. showed the multicolor stack was about 70 feet tall,with 4-5 layers of colored bands). no blinking lights etc. not even metallic glare, only slightly rounded at the top and bottom, maybe 30-40 feet wide,side to side. this may be the answer to where the ufo's that hastled the capital etc., in 1952, vanished to as the jets,from dover afb, came on the scene!. they zoomed up and away then came back under the radar, stacked up quietly and hid in the woods till the jets left, then seperated and went back to their harrassing the capital fun!. what really bugged me, was the fact that my \"vhs camcorder\" would not work(even with the fullycharged batterypak, i had put in after dinner the nite before!)and opps!!, my lil'35 mm quicky still camera needed the one item seven-eleven did not sell, film!!. asking around the group(now 7-9 watchers!!) i found not one camera, of anykind, was available!. someone said\"oh it's going into the clouds\", not really however, the wind was blowing the clouds north to south. this giant\"lifesaver roll\" had not budged, for almost an hour and ahalf!. but, i had to leave at about 7:20 or so, i left for home,to fix and eat breakfast, at last!. as i left, i noticeed the three \"watchers\" had grown to a crowd of 8 or 10; and the store manager said \"i don't know what it is?,but it's great for business\". his coffee and donuts were selling, like crazy, no one wanted to leave(and miss a plane knocking it out of the sky??). real disappointment was no reports in the news etc. just dozens of interviews, about the meteor,of the night before,after all it had upset a football game crowd!. several pilots, flying from europe to eastcoast cities, had seen it streak across the sky and gave \"noah\" an approximate location to where it hit in new york. there had been no reports,or complaints,by pilots about an object being in the way as they approched \"washington national airport\"!!.. a majer question is why?!!, those congressional boobs on the hill seem to think the general public is satisfied with their dumb explinations of what we know, we are seeing more and more everyday\\or night too. i know there must have been dozens more witness's, up and down the potomac river, from dc to mt.vernon, many much closer than we were. maybe you can persuade them to come forward with their story and videos and\\or pics. this is one occurence i, and many more, would like a good solid answer for... thankyou for any help, c.e. love"],"Summary":"i and 6-7 others in 7-11's parkinglot watched a stationary","Weather Factors":"Windy","Date of the Event":"10/20/1982 06:29 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Virginia","Case Number":"10521","Object Shape":"Chevron","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"01:30:00","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.922645","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10521.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10521.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10521.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.922645,+-77.056353(10521)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10521) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.056353","Log Number":"US-04242008-0018","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around October 20th 1982"],"Date Submitted":"10/20/1982 06:29 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
