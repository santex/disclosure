It was moving slowly towards Lake Erie, I was waiting for it to turn towards Hopkins Airport but it continued North East. Then within 3 minutes or so it just disappeared fading slowly. It was very unusual, it was not a plane, we live by the airport and see planes all the time. The object flew at a normal speed as I could tell, and flew in a basic straight line. I just stared at it because at first I thought it was a plane until it disappeared then I was confused. I did not tell my husband who was talking with neighbors (who is now mad about it) but today friends of mine had seen it also and where asking if anyone had seen it so my husband wrote the sighting to MUFON. There are pictures from the 4th and earlier from other people sightings that look like what I saw, I regret I did not et a picture."],"Latitude":"41.503125","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Cleveland","There were 2 other sightings in Cleveland on or around July 4th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24191.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24191.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
