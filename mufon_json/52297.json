Time was just a few minutes after 5am, est. I panned the sky to my left facing south east when all of a sudden, directly in my line of sight, three lights in a perfect triangle just causally passed over head. The lights were not brilliant. More as if there was a mist or cloud cover. The sky itself was perfectly clear with no clouds anywhere visable. The odd thing about the triangle was how it was moving. Instead of being flat and just moving, it had a wobble to it. The triangle was one light in the front and two in the back. It had a slight wobble. Not a fast one, but in the 4 seconds it took to pass over head, it wobbled left to right, left to right. So only to full tilts or slight wabbles. I watched for another 5 minutes, but nothing else."]}
