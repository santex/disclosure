The seeing was excellent and totally steady. I live in the mountains at 3,500 ft ele. I saw what at first thought was a planet.It was at about fourty deg. above horizon in the western sky. I thought it was venus, no Jupiter, no what the heck. It's no where near the ecliptic. What the heck. It was totally stationary. No flashing,no color change,no movement at all. As I was trying to process all this info quickly, to my surprise the light dimmed out to nothing. Other stars in the area were plainly visable and using averted vision I could not see any trace of the light again. I have been an avid amature astronomer for 35 years. I have never seen anything like it. After a while I thought was it a supernova, a meteor coming straight at me, I don't know. I have seen just about everything in the night sky and this freaked me out.
