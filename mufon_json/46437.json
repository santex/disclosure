I couldn't help but notice how clear the sky was. I could see bright stars and notice one that was reddish color and figured it might be mars. It suddenly starting moving downward and to the right. at that point I ran inside to grab my cell phone and tried taking video of it. my phone isn't that great quality and after viewing the video it is only black. It moved downward and to the right and took about 1 minute total. after taking the video I couldn't find the object i was had seen move. it had vanished. I can't tell for sure what date the video is from because i think my cell phone, at the time, had the wrong date programmed. I since have received a new cell phone but the video was transferred to the new phone. I think it was either late January or early February. the object moved slowly with no jerking or sharp turns."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","City":"Gloucester City","Case Number":"46437","Date of the Event":"02/18/2013 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-75.121563","Latitude":"39.912612","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.912612,+-75.121563(46437)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46437) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03262013-0024","Date Submitted":"03/26/2013 11:59 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New Jersey","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Gloucester City","There were no other sightings in Gloucester City on or around February 18th 2013"]}
