{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from work on November 30th at around 6:44 P.M. along I270 headed south towards Georgesville Rd. In between the bridge of Sullivant and Georgesville Road something caught my attention. As I looked I noticed three orange colored lights in the far distance, guessing maybe 10 miles away as the lights from my distance appeared to be very small. As I watched, I noticed 3 additional lights apear with all lights appearing to be equal distance apart from one another. The lights lite up in sequential order with the first light appearing and staying lite while each additional light lite up. The sighting reminded me of the sighting over Phoneix Arizona several years ago. It almost appeared as though the lights were lighting up the outline of a large disk shaped object. The object(s) seemed to be just hovering in place. The night was clear but the lights only lasted for maybe 10 seconds then all six lights just blinked out all at once. I would guess from my view point the object(s) may have been over the Grove City, Obetz, or Circleville area."],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-12012011-0020","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-82.897893","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"33760","Region":"Ohio","Summary":"6 orange orbs of light that appeared to light up in sequential order South of Columbus Ohio","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.423017,+-82.897893(33760)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33760) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/01/2011 10:07 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33760.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33760.html"],"Latitude":"40.423017","Date of the Event":"11/30/2011 06:44 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
