This occurence lasted about two to three minutes. These objects appeared to be linked by some sort of body between the lights that I witnessed. These same lights at one point did what I would call a wagging motion similar to what a military pilot would do as a salute to fallen hero, but this was not as pronounced as whatr what we normally see. I would really like to find out what I saw a few nights ago, but that might not be possible as our own government doesn't beleive its own people anymore.
