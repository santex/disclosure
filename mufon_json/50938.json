I had recently been investigating some strange activity near my house over the past week, so I ran outside to see. I had no idea what they were, and still don't. There were probably 6-10 I saw in total, seemingly appearing, moving from one point to another in straight lines, and then disappearing. This being my third sighting in the sky, I wasn't afraid like before. I was elated, actually, and excited at what I was seeing. Soon they all disappeared, there numbers dwindling down."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.965648,+-95.231231(50938)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50938) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"09/20/2013 09:42 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09202013-0024","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/20/2013 08:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"50938","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50938.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50938.html"],"City":"Lawrence","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
