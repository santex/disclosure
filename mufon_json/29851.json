I just happened to look up and noticed a strange orange light flying around. I thought that it may be a firework, since it is so close to the 4th. When it didn't go away I realized that it was some kind of object flying around. I showed my husband and he couldn't figure out what it was either. It was a bright orange light in a sphere shape. Flying around with no distinct pattern. It would stop and then fly again. I heard no engine or anything. It was weird how it was silent. Soon, a plane flew by and the object disappeared. We both were very spooked and still cannot believe what we saw. There is no way the pilot (on the plane that flew by) could have not seen this object! It looked like a fire ball!"],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-71.469979","Summary":"Orange Orb floating around in sky","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Latitude":"41.586454","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
