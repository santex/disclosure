This is very strange in my back yard I have strange acting lighting bugs,(they seem to flicker many times) not the ordinary one pulse then a pause then another pulse. They seem to act up when I come outside. I have not seen type like these bugs anywhere in the neighborhood, only in my yard. Shortly after seeing this event a UFO will appear above, but recently this sphere lowered down dimly light and change direction toward me when I became nervous about the encounter and I moved across the street. I have such confidence that every time these lightning bugs act up, I will always see up to several spheres above. Has such a thing happened like this? I will record this on digital and submit tomorrow."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48376.html"],"Summary":"For the past few nights and still ongoing, everytime I go to walk my dog I have seen a UFO.","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Longitude":"-75.072606","Case Number":"48376","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Haddon Heights","There were no other sightings in Haddon Heights on or around June 20th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.882338","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.882338,+-75.072606(48376)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48376) map </A>"}
