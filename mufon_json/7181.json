He slept in that morning and moved through the remainder of the day in a casual manner. In the afternoon, he stepped outside for a cigarette. The sky was fairly clear, just a light haze, accented by isolated high altitude clouds. Looking up at the sky toward the south from the back porch of his apartment, he noticed an object moving through the sky. He stated that he often looks toward the sky whenever he gets a chance in order to iden-tify objects such as airplanes, helicopters, etc. This particular object caught his attention because of its unusual shape and movement. As he focused on the object, it changed shape, sometimes appearing as a ball shape, sometimes as a little more elongated, perhaps an arc, then back to a ball with a dot circling around the larger object. He didn���t recall seeing more than two dots or balls at any one time; it was either a big ���blob��� or separated into two objects hovering around each other. He also stated that there was no sound associated with the passing of the object. At this point, he had been watching it for about 90 seconds and the object had moved from east to west. When it started to disappear over the neighbor���s house, he ran up stairs to retrieve a pair of small binocu-lars, a Nikon Travelite III, 7x20. His significant other asked, ���Where���s the fire? What���s the deal?��� Mr. Fox replied, ���I think I���m seeing a UFO.��� He ran back down the stairs, out the back door, and down to the street corner where he could continue viewing the object. He stated that the object, through the bin-oculars, looked like six or seven little objects ���flocking��� together in the same direction, but very close to-gether. He estimated the altitude to be at about 10,000 to 15,000 feet and appeared at about a 45 degree angle. He watched the object until it was just a ���pinprick��� and disappeared off to the west."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"45.531552","Longitude":"-122.666457","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There was one other sighting in Portland on or around March 29th 2007"],"City":"Portland","Case Number":"7181","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply"}
