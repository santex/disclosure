I was lost but in vacinity of Cayuga- possibly between Dunnville and Cayuga. Red orb caught my attention and i pulled over to side of road, woke up my passenger to witness. Orb hovered very still with a warm deep red solid glow- over the tower approx 30-50 feet above top for approx 20 seconds then slowly moved away for about 10 seconds and disappeared. No noise was heard. I felt like this was an unusual object, didnt know what it was, wasnt like anything ive seen before and attracted my attention. I tried to take a picture but by the time i had retrieved my blackberry and unlocked it, the orb had disappeared."],"Region":"Ontario","Latitude":"42.953766","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42601.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42601.html"],"Log Number":"CA-09162012-0015","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"Canada"}
