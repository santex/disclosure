I looked up and this star looked odd and out of place it was very bright, brighter than anything else in the sky and it seemed to sparkle and pulse. I watched it for a minute or so and called my wife outside to show her she to thought it was odd looking and said you should get your camera. That was easy (I do Ebay so my camera was already on my tripod). the object was still there I took about 30 pictures. I went inside after a while and turned my PC on so I could transfer the photo's. after about 20 minutes I went back outside and it was still there no change. Went inside and returned after about 20 minutes and it was gone."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.812259,+-117.885528(45662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45662) map </A>","Date Submitted":"02/10/2013 11:43 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45662.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45662.html"],"Log Number":"US-02102013-0022","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"33.812259","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Anaheim","There was one other sighting in Anaheim on or around January 30th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.885528","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Other","Case Number":"45662","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"California","City":"Anaheim","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
