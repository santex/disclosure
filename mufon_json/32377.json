I stopped at a stop sign and saw a huge craft with multiple green, white, and blue circlular shaped lights on the bottom of it come directly over my head. The lights were all on the bottom in a triangular shape. The size was enormous. To give you an idea for the size - it filled up the entire windshield of my car. It was moving very slowly in a North direction towards the small Lee's Summit airport. That airport is too small for large planes to land. I see planes in the area all the time but this was not normal. A co-worker of mine saw it too. It was flying very low. At first we thought it was a large plane, but it did not look like a plane at all. After it turned towards the airport, it slowed for one minute, then contineud North, which was left of our position, and it went out of sight. I am sending a drawing to the investigator.\""],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.982865,+-94.369578(32377)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32377) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/04/2011 12:00 UTC","City":"Lee's Summit","Summary":"Gigantic low-flying craft on its side over Lee's Summit, MO","Object Shape":"Disc, Triangle"}
