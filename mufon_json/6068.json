I looked up at the sky because I have had three previous sightings since about 1941-2, I did not mention it to any one but my Family. which was hard enough to have them believe the facts. Today I saw the sphere that kept rising until it started to disappear beyond a vapory cloud, it looked like it might have been above the LAX Airport area. I mentioned it to two passer by's, and they said what I said as well, that It looks like a UFO. I had a camera that I keep on me most of the time just in case I'd have this kind of incident, but I could not get it out of my pocket in time to photograph it before it was out of sight. If you contact me I can tell you about the other three sightings that I had, there is too much information involved to write about all the details on this page. But I must say, the incidents are still crystal clear in my mind after all these years, My past events are something that I will never forget. Yours Truly.
