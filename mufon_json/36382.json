I looked and said those are not planes, they are not movie. We went out on the deck to get a closer look. One of the objects appeared closer than the other and was brighter. I noticed a flashing red light around the closer one. The objects appeared in the sky due west and were south of the Capitol building. We continued to look at objects and I called 9 news to see if anything had been reported. At about 9:45 the closer object just disappeared and about 10 minutes later the other object disappeared. We definitely felt we had seen something, but not sure what.
