Light was almost still and just over the horizon, and slowly lowering. Upon viewing in scope it looked like it twice shifted to a half sphere with lights on the bottom edge. (not a great scope) It descended slowly until its view was blocked by a hill. Looked to be about half way to Lodi at the edge of where the foothills start. No rapid movements. No blinking lights. Too large to be a helicopter and too slow for an airplane."],"City":"Valley Springs","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.201106,+-120.820363(15147)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15147) map </A>","Longitude":"-120.820363","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15147.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15147.html"],"Case Number":"15147","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Valley Springs","There were no other sightings in Valley Springs on or around January 26th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"01/26/2009 09:10 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/26/2009 09:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Redish color, minor shifting.","Object Features":"Dome","Country":"United States"}
