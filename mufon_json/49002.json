I had noticed the strange partial ring around the evening sun. As I returned home I took my wife upto the top floor of our home and looked out of the window at the phenomenon and proceeded to take photos on my mobile phone (samsung galaxy s2). It wasn't until we were looking at the photos that I noticed in one of the pictures there appears to be two objects one looked to be metalic and spherical and the other looked to be more like a disk shape also a solid metalic object. We did not see or hear anything at the time and there is nothing on any of the other pictures taken. Please look at the attached photo. The objects can be seen on the left hand side of the picture close to the light phenomenon around the sun."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Leeds","Longitude":"-1.553892","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Leeds","There were no other sightings in Leeds on or around July 15th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/15/2013 07:35 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49002.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49002.html"],"Region":"","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"49002","Latitude":"53.798853","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United Kingdom"}
