Completely silent. The airport is in that direction so I'm familiar with planes going the same way. That is how I was able to guess the size and speed. I watched it until it disappeared into the clouds over the mountains to the ne, about 50 miles or so away. As it flew, it never varied it's course or speed. I wanted to call someone to report it, but I had no idea who to contact. I had never heard of MUFON until tonight on coast to coast, so I thought I might as well send it in."],"Region":"British Columbia","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Cranbrook","There were no other sightings in Cranbrook on or around September 15th 2006"],"Latitude":"49.516768","Date of the Event":"09/15/2006 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","Summary":"SW to NE /silent / 1000ft/ 300mph/ clear sky / light wind.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.516768,+-115.7656(14596)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14596) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14596.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14596.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-115.7656","City":"Cranbrook","Case Number":"14596","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
