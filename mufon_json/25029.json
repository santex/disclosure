It was very far away and it was between me and the clouds. It did not blink at all or change color. It was a solid yellowish white light. I had my camcorder with me and was trying to film it but by the time I got it out it flew into the clouds and I didn't see it. It would have taken me some time anyways to manually adjust my camcorder zoom just to get it focused at that distance. I did not see it again after it flew into the clouds."],"Case Number":"25029","Summary":"Star like bright light was seen flying along the clouds during Sunset.
