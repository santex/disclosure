This time my wife called me out to have a cigarette and witin two minutes or so , the same type and size object moving west to east appeared( aspirin-sized) it got about mid-sky when a plane came into view . The object was moving almost exactly west to east, the plane was heading in the typical SW to NE and as the plane and object got close to each other I said to my wife that the pilot in the plane is probably able to see the UFO , then suddenly the light just went out or kinda faded out within 3 seconds. This only confirmed What I saw earlier in the night. I feel this object decided not to be visible anymore."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"05/17/2009 11:40 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","City":"Tacoma","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05182009-0011","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.262847,+-122.435061(16979)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16979) map </A>","Summary":"2nd object - was a bright bluish white light moving west to east, moved halfway across sky then faded out when airplane appeared in sky.","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
