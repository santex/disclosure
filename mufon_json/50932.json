As I got off the Bridge onto I-95 north. The object was still there to the North East over New Jersey. I wanted to pull over but traffic was flying so I got off The Allagheny ave. Exit. I pulled over got out of my truck and noticed the object was moving in a southeast direction. I called my buddy that I knew was not far behind me. As I was calling him he pulled up next me. He got out . We both wee just standing there watching this Bright White Cigar shaped object very slowly floating. My buddy got really nervous! We both took several pictures with our phones. We watched the object for about 10 minutes until it was out of sight.then we went to work. I seen this object a couple times in the same location a couple times over the years. But today felt compelled to pull over and call my buddy and to take pics. I'm a Foreman for a construction Company. A buddy of mine who works on a different construstion crew saw the same exact object about 1 month about in the same general location. He also has pics. He also has been pron to many UFO sights with pics including a black triangle during a Thunderstrom. The photos my buddy and I took are much more clear on my phone then my IPad which I am sending them from. Look at the light pole in the pics it's close to that."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-75.077354","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
