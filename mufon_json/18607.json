I have taken many pictures of the evening skies from this same vantage point, but have never seen this particular \"line\" in the sky--it did not change over a period of 10 minutes or so, it just got too dark to see. Am an avid watcher of UFO Hunters, & I remember a show about \"tunnels\" or something similar. I realize that this is probably one of those easily explained things, but I would rather send this in & it not be anything than have it the other way around. If it is possible, could you email me to let me know what this is? I did see an object when I was about 10 yrs.old in Visalia, CA,( that would be about l957). It was a glowing rather bright green ball that came across the sky from west to east. Can still see it in my mind, I think I have been looking ever since for another one!
