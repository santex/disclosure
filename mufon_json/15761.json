{"Date Submitted":"07/06/2008 12:40 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsto whom it may concern, i came across a submission from a person who saw an object in gladwin michigan the night of july 6th 2008 on another website..here is the link http:\\\\www.ufoinfo.com\\sightings\\usa\\080706.shtml so i decided i would just report what we saw. there were 4 of us, my sister, her boyfriend who is a police officer in southern michigan, my husband and myself, we were lodging at pointe labarbe inn off of highway 2 near st. ignace mi, point labarbe inn is small cabin resort we were in the back of our cabins having a late night camp fire watching stars when this happened. i am including everything i wrote when i got home from our vacation in as much detail and research as a non professional investigator as i could. i am leaving out names to protect them. our sighting so i pealed through star charts and doing my best to exact my location on the globe. at about 12:30 am est july 6th, west of the mackinac bridge outside st. ignace, michigan, my sister, her boyfriend, my husband and myself were sitting around the campfire chating and watching stars, i was positioned facing the northeast, my husband was positioned facing southeast, my sister and her boyfriend positioned facing southwest. my husband said loudly um you guys he points and stands up( at this point according to him being the first person to see it...he said it just appeared and came toward our direction), so i turn..and my mouth dropped open, i stood up and say a few interesting words, my sister and her boyfriend stand up and we all start saying oh my god! my dumb butt had my camera right there but you know i couldnt take a picture, i didnt want to miss what i was seeing. it came in from the southeast somewhere to the right of aquila (see picture below), i say aquila because it came in toward the right of the star altair, it came in so fast at first i saw this glowing white light and as it passed over us just a little to the southwest of our center location it was almost directly over our heads, as it passed, it had a white center ball then an outside layer of yellow and a thin layer of a light orange, it had a long tail but nothing like meteorites who cast a long after trail when they shoot, this had a tail maybe twice its ball size long, the tail at first it seemed like a fan but it wasnt it had 2 tails one that cast white yellow and orange and one that was clearly blue and both came to points. it was hauling faster than anything i have ever seen, it was in the atmosphere and too my own eyes somewhere between the size of an eraser head and a dime in the sky it's was huge, it was spectacular and very fast(the other acct that i read said it was very slow,, i dont think it was slow just really big it had no sound but you would have expected to hear something like the shuttle launching we didnt have a side view like the other acct. we had a direct view because it came right toward us) , it went all the way to the lower part of the celestial dome in the north, and ursa major was it's background so north of ursa major. now im also well aware that there are several comets happening around earth on those dates, comet c\\2007 w1 boattini, comets c\\2006 q1 mcnaught, c\\2008 a1 mcnaught, and 19p\\borrelly (2008) and according to the info on them you pretty much still need a telescope to get a decent look at them... this was to close to be a comet, so close that when my sister saw it she ducked and covered her head because she thought it was a plane getting ready to crash..thats how close it was, no need to use a telescope it was just that close. i have attached a picture of the best origination, path and ending as far as i could figure according to our location. the event between12:30 and 1:15am and went on for a good maybe 30-50 seconds maybe even longer, the star chart is the most accurate depiction of the stars around that time this is the star positions at our location at 1am. we would have been in the center looking toward the southeast when it came into view it traveled directly over our heads into the northwest where we watched it till it disapperaed out of our range of view. my grandpa was in the air force so i grew up pretty familiar with anything government flown or nasa oriented it's a family pride thing, and when i was young i was obsessed with comets, space ect... i am 34 now, a big sky watcher all my life...i have never ever seen anything like this ever. if you have any questions i'll be happy to answwer anything i can."],"Latitude":"45.868624","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.868624,+-84.727828(15761)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15761) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-84.727828","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15761.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15761_submitter_file1__Picture1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15761.html"],"City":"St Ignace","Summary":"St. Ignace Michigan 6th of July fireball sighting.","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Other","Case Number":"15761","Date of the Event":"07/06/2008 12:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-02272009-0006","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in St Ignace","There were no other sightings in St Ignace on or around July 6th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"Michigan"}
