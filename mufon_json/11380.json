My one friend pointed to the sky and said \"what is that thing in the sky.\" It looked like a boomerang and had red and white flashing lights. It was hovering in place. I thought it was just an odd shaped plane. We all agreed and just continued on with our swimming. I read an article about it in the Bucks County Courier Times. I remembered my encounter last night and realized that it was important that I e-mail MUFON."]}
