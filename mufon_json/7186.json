{"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Yonkers","There were no other sightings in Yonkers on or around October 31st 1985"],"Longitude":"-73.898747","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe sightings happened twice in the same month of November '85, both cases on a Thursday night (I was returning from university classes). The first sighting was on I-95, I believe it was just before the Yonkers toll gates as I was heading north. It was a dark cloudy night which is why I couldn't determine the size. It was coming south at a 30��� angle from my right to the left. It was some 500 ft above the ground, going very slowly, about 20-30 mph, and without sound. I called the Ardsley police upon arrival at a friend's house. I asked them if anyone had called saying they'd seen a UFO. The person on the other side said that many had. I intuitively sensed it was a UFO and wasn't scared, but I was excited. I stayed in the car, and didn't open the window. The second sighting was in Tarrytown, some 10-15 miles NW of my first sighting, two weeks later. (I can't remember if they were the first and third or fourth and second, but alternating weeks.) as I was headed north on Broadway at the center of town, a similar sighting occurred. It was clear enough that a guy in a car in front got out of his car and just screamed out 'I believe'. This UFO might have been flying a little lower than the first one. There were similar V-shaped lights, but I don't remember how many there were. Traffic was moving so I had to continue driving, losing sight of the object. This time I got out of the car. I again heard no noise. It was moving in a similar 30��� angle from my front right to my left rear. I couldn't make out its shaped, but the lights were sufficiently separated at the distance to suppose it was 'large'. There may have been a third sighting, but I have little recollection of the details. It was coming from NJ to NY over the George Washington Bridge. Traffic was a little heavy so cars were just sitting, advancing slowly. As I looked forward, towards the bridge, I saw an object fly low. It wasn't a plane, but I wasn't impressed by it. It could've been a UFO, but I didn't react as I did with the other two."],"Date Submitted":"10/31/1985 09:10 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"New York","Log Number":"US-06092007-0003","Case Number":"7186","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7186.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7186.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Cloudy night, V-shaped set of 5 lights - 2 on one side, 3 the another","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/31/1985 09:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Yonkers","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.93121,+-73.898747(7186)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7186) map </A>","Latitude":"40.93121"}
