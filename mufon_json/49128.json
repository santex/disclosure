Suddenly the lights in the city went off , our cellphones stop working , and then in the middle of the sky there were 4 to 6 green flashes that expanded the whole sky , keep pulsing at aprox. 1 second from each other , the flashes were so intense that when it was produced it was obscuring your view for the 1 sec. period . After the flashes went of , the electricity and the mobile network came to normal . What is odd , the electricity company that investigated the \"fall\" couldn't find anything wrong at the electricity power plant , and when the lights on the street start coming back , they came on stages , one by one . I felt an odd sensation while during the flashes , me and my friends were mesmerized by the event , after that we went to speak with other people in the park , and they also saw it . The origin of the flashes was a small dot , from where it was pulsating with force , the shape is unknown because the flashes were too strong . There was no recorded landings or after-sights of any ufo-objects after that , but it draw some attention from the government since I saw some black helicopters the next several days in the area ."],"Summary":"Green Flashes in the middle of the sky","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Case Number":"49128","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"45.360278","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lupeni","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"Romania"}
