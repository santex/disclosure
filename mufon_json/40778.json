I looked up and saw at least 8 red-orange objects that looked like stars or bright planets. They were moving at a brisk pace. They changed paths,directions, and 1 changed shape so it looked like a red centered clear globe. Some formed an L or V shaped pattern depending on one's viewing angle. Then they continued in a Northwesterly direction and disappeared. I wasn't sure what they were. I thought aircraft but they were silent and changed formations too quickly. I came in and did a search for red lights over Texas and saw that there had been similar sightings in the southern part of the state. I felt that they were very extraordinary. Earlier in the afternoon, the city of Bonham experienced cellphone outages, ATM problems, and difficulty accessing the internet."],"Summary":"Red-orange star-like objects over Fannin County, TX","Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.591944,+-96.205819(40778)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40778) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40778.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40778.html"]}
