I saw the pictures after . I don���t ear nothing and i don���t saw nothing. the aircrafts on the area of ���vora Alentejo Portugal on this date they can't fly because of the ice on the asphalt. If it was a plane i think i can ear it very well. The very strange think that i saw it was the dog. Before the pictures the dog it was very excited and running to diferent locals always playing. after that the dog still calm, quiet and don't play more for 20 or 30 min. I wait for a conclusion Best Regards Sorry my poor Inglish HUGO"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.570983","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Evora","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Diamond, Disc, Other","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"01/29/2006 09:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"ÃÂvora"}
