{"Weather Factors":"None","divs":["sighting detailson oct. 29, '08 i was camped in site 5 loop a of squaw flats campground, needles district, canyonlands nat'l park in utah. i sat at my campfire facing to the south. the night was cloudless and the sky was were extraordinarily clear. something caused me to look up and i saw a brilliant red light (with pinkish\\purplish overtones) sitting motionless in the southwest sky. the object was 20-25 degrees above the horizon and from my viewpoint appeared to be about the size of a pea. were i pressed i would say it was a mile away but i can offer no logical explanation for that impression. my first quick thought was that it was an aircraft warning light atop a communications tower of some kind but then i remembered where i was and knew it could be no such thing and besides it was too big and bright for that. i had been looking at the stars through my binoculars ever since nightfall so i then used them to look at the object. it looked bigger and brighter but i still could not tell whether the object was only the light itself, or whether the light was attached to something larger. after viewing it for 12-13 seconds (maybe 4 of those seconds through the binoculars) it suddenly accelerated and moved at a teriffic rate of speed to the east. once it began to move i took the binoculars from my eyes and watched for 5-6 more seconds until it disappeared behind some juniper trees on the eastern edge of my campsite. the object was silent and flew in a straight line. it gave an impression of fantastic power and grace and just as it disappeared i said to myself, \"oh, please come back.....i want to have a better look at you.\" a minute or two later i went to my camper and found it was exactly 8:30 meaning i must have seen the object at about 8:28. there were three men camped in the next site over (to the west) and they too were around their fire but i didn't hear any excitement or commotion over there so presume they didn't see it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.575986,+-109.54019(14932)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14932) map </A>","Date of the Event":"10/29/2008 08:28 UTC","Latitude":"38.575986","City":"Moab","Longitude":"-109.54019","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:19","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Region":"Utah","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14932.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14932.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01152009-0007","Summary":"A bright red light sat in the sky then suddenly moved rapidly to the east until it disappeared.","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/29/2008 08:28 UTC","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Moab","There were no other sightings in Moab on or around October 29th 2008"],"Case Number":"14932","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
