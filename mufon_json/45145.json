He was looking to the North and saw a bright red triangular object about the size of a quarter at arms-length, move across a short distance (3 inches at arms-length) in the sky. This lasted about 5 seconds, and he could clearly see the shape, it was like having a triangular light bulb in the sky. His friend couldn���t see it. It was almost like a flash. The triangle came from the west (observed in the NNW) and moved northeast. As it moved (in the 5 seconds or so that he saw it) the lights turned off but he could still see the triangular outline of it, then it was gone. Basically the triangle moved in a straight line, was illuminated then \"switched off\" its lights. In terms of color, I guess the object was black, but that might have been a result of it suddenly going dark."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Grand Rapids","Latitude":"42.961195","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-85.658636","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were 3 other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around October 12th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"(ref:43210, Event 2of4 djs cfi) - Large red triangle light streaking across the sky, lasting only for a 3 seconds, very short path","Date Submitted":"01/11/2013 10:16 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
