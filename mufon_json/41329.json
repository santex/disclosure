IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE A HOT AIR BALLOON ON FIRE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN THINK TO DESCRIBE IT. 3 WEEKS BEFORE THIS ONE OF MY FRIENDS CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN THE SAME EXACT THING OVER HIS HOUSE IN EAST ISLIP. IT WAS BY FAR AND AWAY ONE OF THE WIERDEST THINGS I HAVE EVER SEE. AS IT WAS SLOWLY MOVING ACROSS THE SKY IT JUST DISSAPEARED.
