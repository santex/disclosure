As I drove up Wyman st heading north I observed lights that appeared to be too low to be a plane. As I approached the intersection I observed the lights were just above the trees and seemed to be floating in a sort of mist or fog that was just arround the lights. There was no sound coming from it. When I was about 30 ft away the light faded out very quickly and it was gone. I was talking to a colleague from work at the time on my phone. I was really freaked out and had to pull over because my heart was racing and I couldn't stop shaking."],"Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50285.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50285.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-71.25492","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Waltham","There were no other sightings in Waltham on or around August 29th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/29/2013 09:30 UTC","City":"Waltham","Latitude":"42.410802","Region":"Massachusetts","Case Number":"50285","Log Number":"US-08292013-0031"}
