The area is a wide open valley with a clear view in all directions of approx 25 miles or more. It was a clear day, no clouds. I observed a metallic looking object ascending so slowly it was almost hovering. The closest shape I could describe is that of an Airstream trailer. It wasnt very long and the ends had a rounded shape. I continued to observe it for 1 to 2 mins as it basically hovered. As I was riding, I had to take my eyes off it for just a few seconds to correct myself in the road. When I looked back up, it was gone. I was about mid way in the valley and had a clear view of the sky in all directions as it's open desert. I searched every direction from horizon to overhead, it was nowhere to be seen."],"Log Number":"US-02132012-0026","City":"Kingman","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Other","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
