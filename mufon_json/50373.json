I looked up at the sky; I saw stars, helicopters, lots of planes.....too many planes. I live right by John Wayne airport, I'm used to air traffic. I saw 4 or 5 groups of 3 lights in a triangle. The lights were red, pulsating, almost to an orange red, and back to red. They started to move further away slowly, so I headed to another street for a better view. When I got there, only 3 lights were left, 2 fading fast. My dog stopped to pee, so I turned to look at her for a split second, and when I looked back at the sky, the last red light was gone."],"Date Submitted":"09/02/2013 05:57 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"red lights, triangular, pulsating"}
