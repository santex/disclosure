Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"12187","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi am actually a paranormal investigator who was on my way to do an investigation with 3 other team mates. i apologize for not having accurate dates, we didnt think to document the information. i know, of all people right? all i can tell you is that it was around 11pm, and i was the driver of the vehicle. it was during the summer, about five years ago. we were about ten miles from where 281 and 290 west tbone. i happened to look up to my right, way far in the distance and saw blinking lights. it seemed small and i naturally thought it was a plane. the problem was, it was going diagonally toward the left,heading down, at a abnormal speed. at that point i looked at my partner and said, \"is that plane crashing\"? at this point all of us are staring at what we think is a plane about to take its last breath. just as it got about tree level, but about ten miles ahead of us, it abruptly stops in mid air and blows up into three enormous white lights. there was no having to explain to one another what we were staring at. so of course we have all this equipment so we are frantically looking for a shoulder to pull over. at this moment we hit a grove of trees. later we went back going the same speed and it took aproximately 3 seconds to pass the trees. within that three seconds, it somehow had totally vanished. we got no chance to take pics, video, anything. because of the distance away from us, all i can say was it was hovering around the 290\\281 tbone up ahead of us. the interesting thing is, is if you take that right at 281 and keep going you run right smack into stephensville. of course this was a couple of years earlier, but it was a strange coincidence. all participants in this will tell the same story to a t. now, this is where it gets stranger, and as much as i feel crazy for even saying it, i feel i must tell you the whole story. first, this isnt the first ufo run in ive had, that was the second. the first was in the country outside of irving texas. just an fyi, because it seems alittle odd that twice i have seen something so incredible up close and personal. what are the chances, one in thousands, millions? anyway, a year and a half ago or so, ive decided to take my sister in law to fredericksburg texas where my father lives. now you have to realize, that i have been traveling back and forth from austin to fred for about 15 years. i instinctively know where i am at any given moment and can tell by my inner clock how long it will be till my next land mark. now, in order to get to fred from austin, you travel down 290 west going through dripping springs, then there is nothing till you get to the tbone of 281\\290. im explaining to her as we drive through dripping this is where my uncle lives bla bla. so, from that point, you would go the exact same way as we were headed the night of the 2nd ufo sighting. from dripping springs the next town is johnson city. you drive all the way till the tbone at 281, take a right, and johnson city is about 7 miles or so. takes only moments to get there. right when i took a right on 281 my husband called and asked me if i was in fredericksburg yet, i replyed that we were almost in johnson city. from that point we were maybe 3 minutes from johnson, maybe alittle more but not much. three, four, five, ten minutes goes by and my internal clock started going off. something wasnt right. more and more i realized i had no idea where i was. i started really tripping out because after 15 years you pretty much would have to have had a total brain blooper to get lost in five minutes. so i look at nikki and tell her i have no idea where johnson city was, or where we were. im sure she was thinking i was pulling her chain at this point. she had never been to fredericksburg so all she knew was that we were supposed to hit some city called jc. at this point i have no idea of how long we were driving but it felt like about 20 minutes. in the distance i saw a yellow blinking light and a convenience store. about a minute after that i saw a sign that said fredericksburg one mile. my jaw dropped, i was speachless. thats about 45 miles in what seemed like about 15 to 20 minutes. now you have to understand, there is no other way to get to fredericksburg without going through jc, its impossible because you have to take a left in jc, drive 30 through downtown, and then on to fredericksburg. how could both of us have forgotten about driving through a town that only five minutes before i told my sister in law that we were fixing to hit jc. so we forgot in less than five minutes? a whole town filled with lights, stores still open, a flashing roadrunner sighn for a hotel you cant miss coming in to jc, you name it, and you cant miss it. by the time i got to my dads i was grabbing a road atlas and there was absolutely no other way to get to fredericksburg. i purposefully took her back through when we left at night. i knew if she had spaced the whole town seeing it again would jog her memory. she has no memory of going through jc, hye, or stonewall and neither do i. it wasnt until i drew a map of the location to show a friend that i stood speachless looking at the map realizing my \"missed time\"was in the same place as the ufo sighting a couple of years earlier. now i dont get rattled easily, i mean, im a paranormal researcher who thrives on the hopes of seeing a spirit up close and personal. this, has me totally freaked out. on top of that, i have had recurring nightmares of alien invasion for a few years now. in the dreams i never see them, but its always the same type of scenario. they show up in ships and take over yet i never see any fighting with our military and their ships. its just people running and hiding because they are completely defenseless. i dont want to tell too many people about this because i always get that look. the your full of s*** look. i really feel like one of those paranoid weirdos spounting that they had been abducted with probes in the you know whats and so on. i actually would love a better idea than the one i came up with because if its the truth then something happened to me that no one is gonna believe even with the plethera of witnesses, 5 all together with all three times combined. i know that four out of the five for sure will be more than happy to verify my story. unfortunately the first ufo i saw was with my boyfriend at the time and i was 19 and am now almost 37 so i wouldnt even know how to find him sadly. it scared me, honestly, and it gets more scary the more research i do. i would love some help on this and im sure you guys would love to do whatever you can to help. im a interesting case anyway, because this isnt the first thing that has happened to me that is quite amazing indeed. mostly dealing with the paranormal world. oh, by the way, i dont know if this means anything to you, so bare with me. it may mean nothing at all. when i was about maybe 5 or 6, my mother had me over at a friends house. i remember when she put me to bed, that it was a twin bed that sat up against a large window to the right of my head. i remember her tucking me in, then leaving. it seems it was in moments only after she left that i looked out the window and see this huge five pointed star right outside my window. i \"think\" it was a two story but i dont feel comfortable telling you something im notpositive of. if you have ever seen a star saphire, it looked exactly like it only huge. i looked at it, thought nothing of it, and drifted off to sleep. all growing up i never thought it was a dream until i got way older and started to question myself. has there ever been a sighting of anything like that because i have no idea. its probably nothing, i try to be as skeptical as possible in these matters, but i just felt the sudden urge to add that story in as well. its alot of times easier to first reach me by email because i dont answer numbers i dont recognize but you can also leave a message and i will be happy to call you back. i truly hope im just crazy lol, i can handle ghosts, poltergeists, you name it ive been through it and been fine. but with all of the information i just gave you, im sure you can understand that im kinda freaked out. oh, just one more thing, im not trying to write a book, or get noticed because im already in a feild that gets alot of grief from skeptics. i have a good reputation in the community, have spoken at paranormal conferences, and am (as far as i know lol) considered to be extreemly even keeled and analytical about these things. i dont jump to conclusions or go half cocked making outrageous claims like some others in my feild have done in the past. so, trust me when i say i dont want to end up on the news sounding like a lunatic or write some stupid book most ppl will say is fraudulent anyway. so there it is, i am willing to do whatever to get to the bottom of it even if it turns out i really did drive through johnson city and somehow totally forgot right along with hye and stonewall. check it out on the map, you will see what i mean. thank you so much for hearing my story, i hope i didnt throw too much at you at once ;) katrina ps~ i just thought of something. after we got to the location we were investigating after 3nd ufo incident, we also noticed an hour or so later of a meteor shower. we might be able to track the date if its even necessary. oh, and something else which might not be involved with it, but when you get to the road that turns left towards blanco which is where we were initially headed. that turn was only a couple of miles after the sighting. now we are in no mans land, closest town is blanco 10 miles away. this is all nothing but hill country. as i get to the road to turn i notice all these flashing red and blue lights from police and fire trucks. at least four or five cop cars, firetrucks ect. all parked just sitting there. it could have been something totally different, but i do know that it is likely that these officers saw this thing just like we did. maybe they thought it was a plane going down like we did at first. but when it blew up into three huge white lights it was just impossible due to the size of the thing. besides, what crashing plane can stop short and hover? it came in so fast,without a heads up the blanco police could have never gotten there that fast. blanco is ten or so miles away. sorry i just want to tell you as much as i can remember so we can figure this thing out once and for all! oh and i wil give you all the numbers to contact the witnesses after i make sure its ok with them first which im sure it will be fine."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"11/30/2003 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF =
