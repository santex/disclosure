I remember it was Saturday on a spring day. The sky was vivid blue clear as a bell. My friend and I Marcus were with our girl friends and decided to go to a place where many young people at the time went to make out. It was a wooded area about 2 miles out of town. When we arrived we got out of the car and were talking basically having a good time with the girls. I saw the object first coming just over the tops of the trees. The object was a red color with nothing metallic. The object seemed to have some kind of radiating back and forth through it. The object floated over the trees very slowly coming to a clearing then stopped all of a sudden. From the time a first saw it I could not take my eyes off of it. I felt like I were almost hypnotized and at the same time I felt we were being observed. My friend Marcus was talking to me but still had not seen the object. Marcus keeps calling my name but his voice sounded far away. And although I heard and could see Marcus I couldn���t take my eyes off the object. Then I saw Marcus looking at me wondering what I was looking at in the sky. I saw him look around and I realized that he saw it too. His mouth fell open with amaze and seemed to be hypnotized himself. About that time the object went out into the sky at a speed I didn���t think was possible. I am sure faster than the speed of light. I looked at Marcus and he at me. I ask him what he had seen and he answered me saying a UFO."],"Latitude":"31.032957","Case Number":"22217","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.032957,+-85.863824(22217)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22217) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"03/08/2010 12:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Alabama","City":"Geneva","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Geneva","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
