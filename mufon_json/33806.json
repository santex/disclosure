I have never seen any aircrafts that uses green light and moves that fast. I ride a bike and I have seen aircrafts move fast mach speed we were speeding enough to the point where the object would still be visible but it just suddenly disappeared, first time seeing anything like that, after posting it on facebook some other people also said that they've seen it for a second. Could it just me a meteor? It was too green, large, and it was faster than a jet or any airplane the odd thing was that we didn't even hear a sound. It wasn't green lantern and this is not a joke. We tried to catch it on the iphone but it just disappeared."],"trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Lawrenceville","There were no other sightings in Lawrenceville on or around December 3rd 2011"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/04/2011 02:41 UTC"}
