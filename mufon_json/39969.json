We were facing north and noticed the direction of the next town over, a triangular object over the treeline. One by one, three lights turned on. Then two more appeared and displayed the same light pattern. I didn't hear it I couldn't hear crickets chirping. They hovered there for a few minutes, then it was as if the lightswitch was turned off, for they just disappeared. This was in 1999. I just learned two years ago of a military base outside of Astoria, Illinois and I have been close enough to see things dropped into it from airplanes. I've lived here all my life and never knew of this just until recently. That summer sevral sightings were reported and even the local judge wrote something about it in the paper.I just guessing a month and day"],"Region":"Illinois"}
