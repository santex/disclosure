She pointed out that there was a large off-white light in the sky. The sky was partly cloudy and there were a few stars. No star could be this big. It was the size of a marble helled about a foot away from your eye. It keep moving (from were I was standing) millimeters left and right. We called out my Dad to make sure we weren't crazy. He came out and saw it. We were all standing and like a minute after he got out there it flashed. A extremely small red flashing light was there for about 18 to 20 seconds and then diapered in a flash. We all looked as hard as we could and there was nothing in it's place. Nothing we could think of could be out in the sky and just turn out. It scared the crap out of us."],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Graham","There were no other sightings in Graham on or around July 12th 2008"],"Case Number":"11538","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Star-like","Date of the Event":"07/12/2008 09:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11538.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11538.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:18","Date Submitted":"07/12/2008 09:15 UTC","Summary":"A Large Burst of Light","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.069026","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07122008-0017","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
