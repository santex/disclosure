Right before we exited the freeway, I saw a blue light hovering and a white light falling. I thought it was a falling star. They were little lights that would change color between white, blue, and purple. I then saw the white one change direction right at the horizon. It moved up on the other side of the blue light. The blue light started moving at this point. We pulled over on the road to watch. They flew around for about 5 minutes. They would go every direction and when they changed direction it was very abrupt. We wanted to get a closer look so we started to head towards them again. We lost sight for a few seconds and they disappeared. The sky was clear that night. They were far away and moved really fast."],"City":"Natomas","Country":"United States","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Natomas","There was one other sighting in Natomas on or around January 25th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/25/2012 09:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.788111,+-119.408882(35458)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35458) map </A>"}
