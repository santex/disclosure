The lights in my house were dark, and it's a very clear night so I had a really good look at the night sky. I noticed a grouping of lights that were very close together and emitting a bright glow. There were 5 lights, in a kite formation-- basically a diamond shape with a tail. I got my husband and we studied this until the fog moved in-- about a half hour. They pulsated light, and moved around quite a bit, but always returning to the same formation after \"swarming\" I would call it. The lights were very high, but obviously closer than stars, and were definitely not stars. If you looked away from the formation you could see a bluish glow around the formation, unlike a star."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/17/2009 09:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.811962,+-122.367505(14972)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14972) map </A>","City":"Edmonds","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.367505"}
