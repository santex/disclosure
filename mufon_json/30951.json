{"Region":"Virginia","Date of the Event":"08/16/2011 09:20 UTC","City":"Bristol","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"30951","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had stepped out side because I had heard a sound that resembled distant thunder and looked up expecting a cloudy sky, but it is a clear night and right at the top of the tree line there was a large trianguler object with bright lights at each point and a blinking red light in the center. I could also see the outline of the craft against the night sky which allowed me to see the bottom surface of this craft. I had no idea what it was, and the red light made me think it might have been military or some kind of plain and soon after there were planes that began to circle as the craft drifted out of sight going from east to west."],"Object Features":"Other","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/16/2011 09:52 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30951.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Bristol","There were no other sightings in Bristol on or around August 16th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-08162011-0017","Longitude":"-82.1635","Latitude":"36.611664","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.611664,+-82.1635(30951)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30951) map </A>","Summary":"observed a lazrg trianguliar craft with lights at each point with a red strobing light in the center","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
