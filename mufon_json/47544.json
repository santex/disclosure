{"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Round object flasing with a triangular center","Date Submitted":"05/20/2013 11:37 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and I were walking down Delmar Blvd. toward Skinker Blvd. about 8:45 p.m. on May 20, 2013 in University City a part of St. Louis, Missouri. I suddenly turned towards my left because I sensed something, my left ear felt strange, as I did so, immediately I looked up into the sky and saw an object. I told my son to look, at first, he thought it was a helicopter. It was flashing but not like a plane. The colors were reddish gold and kept fading in and out. It was circular but seemed to have a triangular shape in the middle of it. I tried to take a picture of it on my phone but it would not show up. I asked it to come closer and then it disappeared. I wondered as I looked at it,if it had anything to do with the weather. a tornado watch was in the forecast for our area at the time."],"Date of the Event":"05/20/2013 08:45 UTC","Case Number":"47544","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.666233,+-90.331081(47544)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47544) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-90.331081","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Missouri","Log Number":"US-05202013-0020","City":"University City","Latitude":"38.666233","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47544.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47544.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in University City","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Dome","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States"}
