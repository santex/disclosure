Sent to the local mufon chapter same time: i just saw two very unsual objets glide slowly across the sky over novato in a northeasterly direction. they arrived about two minutes apart and were bright bright orange like fireballs,. oi don't know much about meteors but i went to a meteor reporting website and everythinkg there was reported as being blue or green or multi colored and having a tail and burning out and etc. these objects lost no intensity of color. that stayed the same as they each kept going until they disappeared into the horizon. they were off of flight paths i'm sure. in fact the second one passed right past an airplane headed easterly toward sfo or oakland airports. another strange thing. they made no noise whatsoever. i have cell phone video but its not very good. i would love to have someone analyze it or even better, if anyone else saw it how can i connect. thanks."],"Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Novato","There was one other sighting in Novato on or around May 31st 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38707.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38707.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/01/2012 02:56 UTC","Case Number":"38707","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"like fireballs but def not meteors, bright fire that never faded. seemed on a flight path. crossed paths with an airplane.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-06012012-0006","Longitude":"-122.569737","Latitude":"38.110713"}
