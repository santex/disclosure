{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI thought I saw a shooting star, but then there were 2 of them travelling close together. I then thought it could be a bird due to flapping movements, but they were spinning, not flapping, and travelling far too fast. The objects were rotating fast, and moving close together, but not maintaining a set distance. Too close together to be planes, they flew over at night and passed over street lamps heading ahead of us, before changing direction to the left, and disappearing in to the cloud cover. 2 of my friends also noticed, one knew it was nothing she had seen before but maintains there is a non paranormal explanation, one believed it was 2 white birds but could not satisfactorily explain why they were going so fast and giving off a white light (it was dark)."],"City":"Cambridge","Case Number":"44626","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.373616,+-71.109734(44626)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44626) map </A>","Latitude":"42.373616","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Cambridge","There were no other sightings in Cambridge on or around December 17th 2012"],"Longitude":"-71.109734","Region":"Massachusetts","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44626.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44626.html"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"2 white objects passed over silently and disappeared.","Log Number":"GB-12182012-0008","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/18/2012 08:28 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"12/17/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Appendage(s)"}
