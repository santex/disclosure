My mother and daughter, who were campingwith me, had already gone to bed, and I was enjoying some quiet time alone nearmy dying campfire. I was reclining in my chair, looking at the stars on what wasa fairly clear night. At around 11 pm, I noticed that one of the stars in thenortheast part of the sky was starting to move. It moved slowly towards thesouth, increasing in brightness dramtically as it did so. At its brightest, Iwould compare it in appearence to Venus, but about 2-3x larger. After about 5-10seconds it slowed and stopped moving, dimming to its original brightness. It satmotionless for about 30 seconds, then increased in brightness again and shot offat a very high rate of speed towards the east, disappearing behind some hills onthe horizon. At no time did it make any sound."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.027733","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"","Case Number":"1340"}
