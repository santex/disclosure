Before I saw it, there was a loud noise, something like a large diesel engine. At first, I could only hear the loud noise. After looking around the sky and past all of the trees, I finally saw the object. It was coming from the West, over a high hill. It was moving really slowly. It didn���t have any wings, or windows that I could see. The \"ship\", appeared to be about two hundred feet from the ground, and moving at about five to ten mph. It was a moonless night, but as the ship moved overhead, I could see some writing on the underside, which resembled Egyptian Hieroglyphics. The ship was about 40 feet by 40 feet square, and about a hundred feet tall, and black in color. From the time I first heard it, to the time I finally saw it disappear over the hill to the East of town, it was probably almost an hour. Last year, I was talking to a friend, who said they also saw the same object. They also live in the Petaluma area. To date, I have not seen any more objects of this type. This sighting was in my backyard. I am very interseted in UFO's and their possible origins, and would like to make actual contact with these beings. I am a Sensitive, so I am more in contact with these type of things. It was an interesting sighting, and one that would be nice to see again."],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","City":"Petaluma","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Petaluma","There were no other sightings in Petaluma on or around June 30th 2002"],"Log Number":"US-02212007-0003","Case Number":"6431","Date of the Event":"06/30/2002 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"about 40'X40' SQ., and possibly 100' tall.
