{"Region":"Texas","divs":["Sighting DetailsThere it was again! I went outside for my afternoon break and looked up at the sky and was shocked to see the same disc as I saw yesterday in the same location. Traveling from northeast to the southwest. There is one difference; this time after watching for about one minute, it turned around and headed back to the northeast. I watched it for about five minutes until it went past the treeline."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Dallas","Disposition":"Hoax","Log Number":"US-08082008-0017","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"11990","Longitude":"-96.763453","Date of the Event":"08/08/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There was one other sighting in Dallas on or around August 8th 2008"],"Latitude":"32.807355","Summary":"Daylight sighting of shiny disc above Denton","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11990.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11990.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.807355,+-96.763453(11990)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11990) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/08/2008 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None"}
