We then saw a second flash about 5 minutes later that was almost instant. Around 11:40 we both noticed an odd formation of stars in the east we had not noticed before in the form of a cross. The 2 stars in the middle started to slowly move to the north west and one behind the other picked up speed as they turned towards the north untill they vanished out of sight. We know both stars where stationary at first and slowly picked up speed untill they moved out of sight in the northern hemisphere at a speed 5-10 times faster than the original speed. there where also 2 other flashes of light but we where not able to corispond what we saw with each other.
