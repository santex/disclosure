{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my way back to my college dorm travelling south on I-85, and it was a little past twilight. The moon was full and extremely bright because there was no cloud cover. When I was approaching the Williamston exit I notice two lights in the sky. I assumed that they were just landing lights from a commercial airliner, but as time passed I realized that it wasn���t moving towards me, but hovering in one spot. It���s hard to recall how high up it seemed to be, but it made me think of how a helicopter would hover when doing a traffic report. I rolled down my window to see if I could hear anything from it, but there was no sound that I could tell. If it had been an airplane or a helicopter at that altitude it would have definitely been heard. After I passed underneath it, I noticed that it had begun to move off fairly quickly in the opposite direction. It seemed to me that other people on the road had witnessed this as well because some drivers were slowing down, and some were even pulling off the road. There were three extremely bright blue-white lights on the front tip and on the end of each ���wing���. There were also no hints of metal on the object. Since the moon was very bright I would assume that it would have reflected off the surface, but all I saw was a black mass. Its shape was a little hard to explain. It was almost like a stealth fighter shape, but the edges weren���t as sharp. It was a little smoother and more triangular."],"Region":"South Carolina","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"13070","Summary":"Chevron shaped UFO seen on I-85, Anderson, SC.","Object Features":"Wings","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.504899,+-82.642443(13070)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13070) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"10/14/2008 08:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13070.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13070.html"],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Anderson","There were no other sightings in Anderson on or around October 14th 2008"],"City":"Anderson","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle","Latitude":"34.504899","Log Number":"US-10152008-0012","Longitude":"-82.642443","Date Submitted":"10/14/2008 08:40 UTC"}
