(at this point i had a suspicion already...turned off the car and radio) got out of the car and looked directly at it......and as it was coming closer, i could begin to see inside the \"orb\" which was only a layer of light glowing around the craft, and inside was a disc shaped craft, with a classic bubble top, spinning, and gyrating, in a rocking motion, syncronius with the tilt of the rainlike red beams, at 1\\2 second intervals.... there was also light \"spikes\" on the top and sides, giving the orb-like shape a triangle overlay kinda. as i was watching this saying \"omg, omg... do you see that\" my friend told me there was another one... and there was, coming from the exact same area. they all passed overhead about ten seconds apart...as one dissappeared over the horizon, another would appear, and one would be overhead; so there were 3 visable all the time, one always close overhead scanning, as they all did. we saw 7 total, and very close, maybe 500 feet away as they passed, almost directly overhead. lots of detail in the \"lightshow\" but the craft were spinning and gyrating, so we couldn't make out small features. the orb shape, and the trialgle points were all bright orange-yellow, but the beams were like red rain scans that abriptly ended about 50 ft below the craft in a circular pattern, as if hitting an invisable surface. they were all identical as far as we could tell. all was silent. i could hear nothing from the sky. but my hair seemed to stand up a bit as each craft passed. it gave me chills and warm flashes. they seemed holographic almost. i am just in shock. they really are here. i have so many questions now..."],"Summary":"7 craft, orb sheilds with triangular points, but spinning discs inside, all traveling single-file, scanning, about 10 seconds between each craft traveling to the south from our north","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-155.065343","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.577377,+-155.065343(34566)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34566) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere, Triangle","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Latitude":"19.577377","Date of the Event":"12/31/2011 11:40 UTC","City":"Kurtistown","Date Submitted":"01/03/2012 06:54 UTC"}
