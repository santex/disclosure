My son ran inside and told me to come look at this thing in the sky. I stepped out onto the front porch steps and there was a black triangle floating over our house and the tree tops. It had 3 round white lights before each tip. It was massive. No noise. Just a vibration in my chest. I ran inside to get a video camera and when I returned outside my hands would not work the camera. I was just fixated on the triangle. It hovered and moved very slow. It slowly moved over the trees and toward the east out of sight. I really dont remember it leaving. just remember it wasnt there anymore. after my family went inside I stood outside with my digital camera in case it came back. two low flying black helicopters with flashing lights flew over my house followed by two planes. I flashed the planes with my camera and one turned around and flew over my house again. I remember feeling sad when the triangle was gone. I wanted to be close to it. like I missed it."],"Summary":"triangel shape ufo with 3 lights hovers over the house and trees.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26550.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26550.html"],"Region":"Georgia","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11132010-0011","Date Submitted":"11/13/2010 07:03 UTC"}
