{"Case Number":"19758","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were flying kites with the kids one afternoon. We took multiple pictures of the kids and of the kites. We have several pictures of our \"penguin\" kite 200 ft up. Later when we looked through the photos we could see that there was something butterfly shaped far above the kite! The object only appears in one of the pictures, not in the photos taken before and after. For this photo, we had zoomed up onto the kite because it was at the top of several rolls of kite string and was higher than the other kites would go. The object above the kite seems to be very high up, colored, and we have not idea what it is. We didn't see it live; just saw it when reviewing the photos later so don't know how fast or slow it might have been moving... if we hadn't zoomed in, I'm not even sure we would have been able to see it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19758.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19758_submitter_file1__Kite_UFO_March2007.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19758.html"],"Log Number":"US-09302009-0020","Longitude":"-78.253605","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Flying kites, we took a pic of our kite 200 ft up, and later saw in the pic there was something butterfly shaped far above the kite","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Latitude":"35.960986","Region":"North Carolina","Date of the Event":"03/18/2007 03:30 UTC","City":"Bunn","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bunn","There were no other sightings in Bunn on or around March 18th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.960986,+-78.253605(19758)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19758) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"09/30/2009 10:20 UTC","Country":"United States"}
