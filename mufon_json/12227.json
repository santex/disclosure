I first thought it was a slow moving meteor. I estimated the speed to be around Mach 1, since I have seen many fighter jets, but the object was completely silent and did not emit any sound consistant with commercial or military aircraft. My residence is by a small airport, but the object traversed an area directly over my head to the horizon in about 15-20 sec, which is almost impossible for a civilian aircraft, and a fighter would probably have to be in afterburner. The object had flickering lights underneath that blinked in rapid succession and were blue, red, and white. The object was about 300 feet long and diamond shaped."],"Longitude":"-84.478115","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.742169","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.742169,+-84.478115(12227)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12227) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Diamond","Summary":"Fast moving, silent, elongated diamond with rapidly blinking lights underneath","Case Number":"12227","Log Number":"US-08262008-0013","Date of the Event":"08/23/2008 01:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in East Lansing","There were no other sightings in East Lansing on or around August 23rd 2008"],"Region":"Michigan","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
