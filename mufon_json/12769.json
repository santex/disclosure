I saw a bright light moving south east. It was rather bright and moved like a plane. I was watching it trying to figure out what it was, when it began to flicker. It then became very bright and seemed to change colors and then it shot off straight east and disappeared. The sky was very clear. We could see the stars clearly, but there was no sign of it."],"Summary":"weird light","Latitude":"40.196777","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12769.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12769.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.196777,+-85.3845(12769)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12769) map </A>","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Muncie","There were no other sightings in Muncie on or around September 25th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Flash, Unknown","Case Number":"12769","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Muncie","Date Submitted":"09/25/2008 06:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"09/25/2008 06:30 UTC","Region":"Indiana"}
