Noticed fairly large, bright oval red light flash, followed by a light neon green light flash in different shape. Too dark to see any object. Just consistant alternate flashing of red and green. Staired at it for a few minutes to see if it was lights coming from top of the mountain but seemed to stay in the same position as we were driving. May have been about 500 feet in the air. We were traveling very slow about 20 miles an hour due to ice on the road. I continued to stare for about 3-4 minutes as we drove. Decided to pull my camera out and take a picture but as soon as I got it ready the lights turn off and there was just blackness. As I stared at the flashing light I tried to think of an explanation. The red was very bright but the green was a color I had not seen before. Seemed to have some line pattern such as a static electricity ball. There was no sound."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8793.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8793.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
