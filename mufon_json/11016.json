My son noticed the bright light and pointed it out to me. I told him to grab the binoculars and look at it because it was not a star. He told me that it was a cone with lights on the corners. We were about 10 minutes out of T or C so I immediately pulled over and began taking pictures with my Nikon 200mm. It was north of us close to where we were going to camp so we headed towards it. About 5 minutes south of T or C my son told me it was turning red and beginning to move. I stopped the VW camper and had time to take one picture during the red shift just before it vanished. I did not see it leave as I was trying to get a second shot."],"Log Number":"US-06032008-0001","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Truth or Consequences","There was one other sighting in Truth or Consequences on or around May 31st 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11016.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11016_submitter_file1__DSC_0377.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11016_submitter_file2__DSC_0382.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11016_submitter_file3__red_shift.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11016.html"],"Region":"New Mexico","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Tags":"City","Case Number":"11016","City":"Truth or Consequences","Summary":"Conical shaped plasma UFO with lights on corners","Latitude":"33.128405","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
