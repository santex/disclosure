{"divs":["Sighting Details The same year that hurricane opal hit florida just months before my parents and I were in the front yard of the house talking. We were in a wooded area but surrounded by many houses and no one else was around. All of a sudden moving from west to east we saw (3) three triangular shaped ships making no noise flying slowley over the tree line with green marker lights on each corner (9) nine lights total. There was no clouds or lightning, the flight over the house took only a couple of seconds and then the crafts disappeared over the next tree line. Since then I have heard many stories of far off sightings in the holmes county area and 1 abduction in the city of bonifay."],"Latitude":"30.767733","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/20/2009 12:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.767733,+-86.565718(21066)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21066) map </A>","Longitude":"-86.565718","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"3 triangular shaped ships spaced out with green lights","Case Number":"21066","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/13/1995 08:14 UTC","Log Number":"US-12202009-0005","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Crestview","There were no other sightings in Crestview on or around July 13th 1995"],"Region":"Florida","City":"Crestview","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21066.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21066.html"]}
