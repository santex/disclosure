{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Fleet of UFOs flew over the house, the whole house shook...","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was getting ready for bed to go to work last night when the whole house shook. I came down stairs and saw my mother and my brother staring up at the sky. There were UFOs everywhere. It reminded me of photos I have seen taken in Mexico City. It was a fleet of UFOs. My brother counted about 20 of them flying due West towards the Gulf of Mexico. And within moments they were gone. I went back to bed...and tossed and turned all night. Thats it. But...thats not the first time I have seen them down here. I have seen UFOs many, many, many times down here in Fort Myers, Florida.
