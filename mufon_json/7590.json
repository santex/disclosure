I came back home about 5 at the afternoon, the sky was cloudy and the skylight done. I don't know why but I turn over ant I could see behind me a static white cylinder about 45��� (or more) in the sky, less than 500 metters (altitude) and about 1 km from me. I can't remember a particular feeling, just what is it ? The object was like a small airbus but without wing and tail with large windows (about 4 times bigger and less oval than a classic plane window). I can't remember how long I was staying to observe the object, perhaps 1 or 2 mn, also I can't remember if it was me or the object who was living the first, but I don't remember the cylinder going away.
