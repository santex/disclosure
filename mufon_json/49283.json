30 miles away as the crow flys. it was huge, there was a full moon that night and the difference between the moon and the object was like a 50 cent piece and a dime held out at arms length. it was extremely bright and had a beam of light like coming from it as though it was searching for something. there were no helicopter cops in those days plus there isn't even any populated places in that area, some cabins here and there that are usually closed up at summers end. we pulled over and got out of the van. we watched it for about 5 minutes when suddenly the beam shut off and the object streaked away and disappeared in a split second. my aunt was saying not to let my cousin (he was about 9yrs old then)know that we just saw a ufo, that it would scare him. my father had been in the navy assigned to a aircraft carrier in the early 50's, he said he had never heard of or seen anything like that before. it didn't make a sound & again i have never before or since seen anything that bright white. it was in the fall and it was cloudy out, but where the object had been was devoid of clouds, like the heat of the thing dissipated them and you could see thru to clear sky. the weird thing is on the road coming from tahoe before we saw it we noticed all kinds of animals. all of us had traveled that road dozens & dozens of times & never saw that many animals during one trip. my dad was saying there must be a bear or cougar lurking about scaring the smaller animals. also i remember the trip up until the point when the object disappeared, don't remember getting back in the van or the rest of the trip. and we didn't talk about it for at least the next 15 years or more. don't know why, but when we did with each other at separate times we all remember it exactly like i just described. even my cousin said \"yeah i remember the time we saw a ufo but mom thought i'd be scared so you guys pretended it was nothing\" then he described his memory of it and it was exactly like mine. so the since then i have been looking at the sky hoping to see that again. and i have seen a lot of unusual objects, especially in the last couple years. more so in the last couple months at night with astronomical binoculars. i'll file a report about a couple very interesting things i saw a few weeks ago."],"Region":"California","Longitude":"-117.074673","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.713396,+-117.074673(49283)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49283) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.713396","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-07292013-0010","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
