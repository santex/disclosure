{"Log Number":"US-02182009-0009","Country":"United States","Summary":"Pulsating star-like UFO.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting details2-16-09 pulsating star-like ufo in eastern sky while driving south on highway 75 between hwy 370 and capehart rd, i happened to glance east and noticed an unusually bright \"star\" sitting at the 10 o'clock position, approx. 60-70 degrees off the horizon. i have been avid astronomy for over 25 years and know the brightest stars that occupy this area of the sky to be sirius and procyon. i���m also fairly certain it was too early for regulus or alphard to be that high above the horizon and they aren���t as bright. i estimate it was magnitude 0 at the peak. the object caught my attention since i knew there shouldn���t be another star that bright in the area. it was also changing brightness levels. i don���t believe there were any clouds to cause the brightness fluctuations and the weather history for that date verifies this: history for omaha offutt, ne monday, february 16, 2009 6:55 pm 34.0 ���f 22.5 ���f 63% 30.06 in 10.0 miles sse 8.1 mph - n\\a clear the object also seemed to be in motion, but there were absolutely no navigation lights as found on normal aircraft. there were about 3-4 other jets in the sky that all had the normal strobes and lights on them. this object then seemed to vanish after about a minute, so i pretty much forgot about it as we were approaching our exit onto capehart rd. as we got to the exit ramp, i noticed it had returned. a commercial airliner was flying east in the same section of the sky and this object almost seemed to make a maneuver to avoid crossing paths with the jet, then settled into a steady glide in a west-northwest direction. i had pulled onto the shoulder and asked my passenger melissa to take a look and she saw the exact same thing. we were both very intrigued that it seemed under intelligent control, i.e. it didn���t simply streak and fade, or have any sort of greenish trail like a meteor. after watching for another 30-40 seconds, the object made a banking maneuver north in a deliberate fashion and then slowly faded from view. a very impressive event for us!"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.159881,+-95.929317(15572)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15572) map </A>","Case Number":"15572","Date of the Event":"02/16/2009 06:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/16/2009 06:45 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","City":"Bellevue","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15572.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15572.html"],"Longitude":"-95.929317","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Bellevue","There were no other sightings in Bellevue on or around February 16th 2009"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Nebraska","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.159881"}
