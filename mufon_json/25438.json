The object was at my 11:00 position but very high over head. We are in a landing pattern for Newark Airport but it was too high for a jet, helicopter or the like. The object appeared all of a sudden. It appeared to have a reflective surface as the part that I could see seemed to be reflecting sunlight, as the sun was almost overhead at that time. The object moved from my left to my right and then it stopped and moved back again in a zig-zag pattern. It seemed to stop and hover for a split second but it was hard to tell. It was very high up as I could see conventional airliners heading to the airport. It was there for about 5 minutes then I did not see it again. I went and got my camera but it was gone by then."],"Latitude":"40.807825","Case Number":"25438","Date of the Event":"09/11/2010 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Bloomfield","There were no other sightings in Bloomfield on or around September 11th 2010"],"City":"Bloomfield","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"The object was high in the sky and the object moved in a zig-zag pattern.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-74.178381","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None"}
