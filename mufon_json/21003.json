We were just acting crazy and were recording videos of eachother when I look up into the sky and just see these 5 bright yellowish cirlces flying across the sky, some moving faster than others. We had no idea what we were seeing because it was nothing we have ever seen before. It couldn't have been airplanes because there was no noise and no flashing lights at all. I didn't think they were meteors or shooting stars because they were going up into the sky, not down, and they didn't look like them what so ever. It only took them alittle over a minute before we lost sight of them."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.904492,+-77.030446(21003)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21003) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12152009-0010","Date Submitted":"12/15/2009 09:31 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Virginia"}
