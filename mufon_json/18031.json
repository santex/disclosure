The object was a yellow and red sphere that pulsated and changed colors and shape between yellow and red. It flew over our house silently and crossed the George Bush IAH westbound landing flight path. It pulsated and slowly flickered until it disappeared. We are 7 miles from the IAH airport flight tower.
