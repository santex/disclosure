{"Region":"SÃ£o Paulo","Date of the Event":"01/07/2010 02:44 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"26598","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsHello, I was traveling in Brazil and I decided to take some shots from the patio with my new Nikon Camera during the night. You can see from the sequence of shots that I was doing tests to get the best results for night shots. They are all high def shots, some with some motion blur but some good ones. When I move the files from my camera to my computer I was able to see the objects and some of the pictures. The pictures are in sequence and always pointing for the same side of the building, but some with 300MM zoom other's with 70MM. So, I would like to know more about it, what they are of if this is some reflex from my lens of something else. It's not my first time facing this kind of objects, I saw another one flying over chicago during the day and I took another picture from inside of the airplane.
