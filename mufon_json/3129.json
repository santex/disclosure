{"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.660297","Summary":"Saw trianguler shaped black object ...high rate of","divs":["Sighting Details Huntington Beach, Ca. 7-13-04 We were on the way to the bank when we first saw the object. I noticed a small arrowhead shaped object travelling at a very high rate of speed just off to the right of our car. The first thought was that it was a plane, yet it was flying very fast with no sound. Next it changed from white to black as it headed in a southeast direction. I realized that this was some kind of UFO either a black op type plane or something else. The object never changed its course, kept a straight line the entire minute I had to watch it. The objsct changed from a white to black as it travelled. I watched until the object was no longer viewlable. My mother also witnessed this event aswell. We were in our car the duration of the sighting. Emotions durring and after...what the hell."],"City":"Huntington Beach","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"3129","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 49 other sightings in Huntington Beach","There were no other sightings in Huntington Beach on or around July 13th 2004"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3129.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3129.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Date Submitted":"07/13/2004 02:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.999226","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.660297,+-117.999226(3129)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3129) map </A>","Region":"California","Log Number":"","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/13/2004 02:30 UTC"}
