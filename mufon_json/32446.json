{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailswas in my backyard to throw out trash looked up at a bright lit star or planet looking object and from it came a triangle shape object NO LIGHTS but was reflecting lights from below heading out from inland camarillo area west over our house out to ocean. It was flying low at first but as it continued over head reached a high elevation and was able to see possible navy plain or county plane fly below its path. Both my Fiance and I where watching so i know I'm not crazy. Typically clouds move in the opposite direction. This object seemed to hoover over us at one point and we both asked ourselves if it could see us.
