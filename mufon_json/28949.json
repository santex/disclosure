I was staring outside my window towards the sky when a really bright light came out of nowhere. I continued to stare at it while calling my friend to it's attention. The bright light split into two, then it split into three bright lights, still having the light intensity as it had when it was only a single bright star. It was not an airplane because it was lower in elevation, it was very bright and there were many airplanes near us amplifying the difference between the lights. I looked at it and found no sign of a body, just a bright light. we tried to make a U turn but it was already gone . It was crazy and i know people are going to be skeptical but I don't care. I know what i saw and my friend does too. It was exhilirating and I wish I recorded it. It happened so fast and it was too exciting to look away from it."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05052011-0002"}
