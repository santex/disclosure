(stupid) as it passed over there seemed to be no noise, but we do have a highway not too far away. however, it did seem to turn into a plane as it flew overhead because the lights started flashing almost like an airplane and hadn't before. so, i do have my doubts that it wasn't anything more than an airplane. i had looked at flight tracker 20 minutes or so after i got my computer up and running, but i hadn't seen anything near us\\let alone from the branson airport(kbbg). so, i will purchase and or find my cable tomorrow and hopefully it showed up on the camera i had. i will send daytime photos of the area as well."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.742468","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.742468,+-93.376839(51731)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51731) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
