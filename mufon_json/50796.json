There was thick fog; as I was speaking with my friend, I caught a light with the corner of my eye. I instinctively watched the sky over my head, and saw a glowing disk, of a yellow-greenish colour, flying over my head. I believe it was flying at an height of about seventy to three hundred metres and it had to be of five to 50 metres in diameter. The sighting lasted a little longer than a couple of second, and the object disappeared behind a house"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Summary":"A huge glowing disc flying over my head and disappear behind a house","Longitude":"9.222142"}
