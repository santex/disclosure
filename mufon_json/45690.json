The first thing I thought when I first noticed 2 of the objects were that they wer either planets or bright stars in the morning. No noticeable wings or tail features as seen on aircraft, no contrails. These objects appeared to very large when I was looking at them compared to a normal jet airliner. These 3 objects were moving very fast. There were 3 objects, 2 of witch were flying side by side and a 3rd oject following. All 3 looked the same. It was difficult getting a photo with all 3 objects using a cell phone. I was able to get one photo with the 2 obects in front and another photo with the object following. I should have been able to get all 3 in one photo but it was hard trying to get them in the view finder of cell phone. All 3 just flew off into horizon. Not sure what I saw, but it did effect me in such away that I did stop and try to get some good photos."],"Log Number":"US-02122013-0015","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/12/2013 06:22 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.16486,+-78.168998(45690)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45690) map </A>","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Winchester","There were no other sightings in Winchester on or around February 12th 2013"],"Region":"Virginia","Latitude":"39.16486","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder","Case Number":"45690","Longitude":"-78.168998","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
