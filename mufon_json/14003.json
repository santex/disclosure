I have had multiple sightings of light that appear to be stars but they are moving in very strange Zigzag motions. They appear to be descending and then shooting up very fast. They are not stars and I have never seen anything like this before. Is their any local location or authorities I can report to? I also have video of these events. This has occurred multiple nights in the last week. I am also seeing it tonight. This was a long night of watching the sky. I first noticed what a nice night it was and how clear the sky appeared. Then a light appeared to be moving and that is when I first noticed the object. It appeared to maintain still for moments at a time and then appeared ascending and desending rapidly. I came in got a camcorder and begain shooting the sky, the first night I had issues getting a good shot with the camera but the next night I could see it much better. Thanks"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Alabama","Log Number":"US-11252008-0010","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Calera","There were no other sightings in Calera on or around November 22nd 2008"],"Tags":"City","City":"Calera","Date of the Event":"11/22/2008 01:05 UTC","Summary":"Unusual sight.","Case Number":"14003","Disposition":"Unknown"}
