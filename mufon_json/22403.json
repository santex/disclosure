I just wanted to Report the Loud sonic booms,Why would an aircraft need to go that fast? over a small town... were they chasing something?"],"trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Logansport","There were 2 other sightings in Logansport on or around March 17th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"03/17/2010 08:31 UTC"}
