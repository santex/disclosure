They were red without any flashing aircraft lights traveling at the speed of a helicopter approximately 400 mph. I told my adult daughter who was standing inside our foyer to come out and look at them . As she came out one of the lights went out leaving two of them to fly silently directly over our heads and we lost sight because of the house. My wife had gone out on the back deck while my daughter and I were out front and she said that only one was observed traveling south until it went out of sight.Our feelings were more curiousity than any thing else. I knew that these were not normal aircraft from the first due to their location to each other and their direction of travel . We are on the flight path for BWI and we have commercial flights flying over our home daily from the west to easterly direction not from the north to the south."],"Summary":"{nd} Three red lights traveling from north to south at 400 mph","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Ellicott City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
