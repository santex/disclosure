It looked as if it was an airplane, as Drake field is less than a mile from the event. We watched it as we drove south and got closer. It was not an airplane, because it was not moving, only huvering. It was lite up enough to see it had mass, but it's shape in entirty was not visable in the dark. We slowed as we drew nearer, as did a vehical in front of us. As we past the object it became blocked by trees, so I had my wife turn around and go back, with phone camera at the ready. As we reached the point that we should be seeing it, it was gone. I am a man with a rather scientific mind. This event left me confused, as I can not logically explain what we saw. This is the second object event for us since 2007, and the 4th unexplained light event in the same amount of time."],"Date Submitted":"01/08/2011 01:04 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Patterned Surface"}
