As we left the building, we noticed three balls of light moving slowly from west to east. The were almost the same color as the street lights, so I moved to a clearing away from the street lights to get a better view. All three eventually disappeared into the clouds, but were later seen by family in a town 45 miles away only a few minutes later. All three flew in unison almost directly over the Snake River Canyon. There were at least 20 to 30 other witnesses."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.584882,+-114.477946(48433)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48433) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"06/22/2013 10:25 UTC","Summary":"Bright orange balls of light","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Idaho","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"48433","Longitude":"-114.477946","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Twin Falls","There were no other sightings in Twin Falls on or around June 22nd 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"42.584882","City":"Twin Falls","Date Submitted":"06/26/2013 02:55 UTC"}
