I was arround 14 years old the time.We was at a corner from the street my house was on. I looked up and saw two glowing objects heading southwest. They slowed down then headed in the opposite direction. It made no turns at all. I was shock because i knew it could not be a a plane of helicopter. It was like a car driving forward the slowing down to back up. I turned my head to show my brothers but as they was about to look the two objects were gone. It was my second ufo sighting since I was little."],"Latitude":"40.737037","Date of the Event":"07/11/2008 12:00 UTC"}
