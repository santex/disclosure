(i didn't think to check the wind direction that evening, but it was a calm night. i think it was clear, but i forget.) the flames seemed more horizontal than vertical to me, but then i was biased by thoughts of aircraft."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08232012-0021","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Coralville","There were no other sightings in Coralville on or around August 20th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/23/2012 11:59 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41977.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41977.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Region":"Iowa","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"3 balls of flame weaved, then maintained a spearhead formation and headed to south horizon","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.682772","Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Coralville"}
