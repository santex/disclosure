I was looking north east over the port of Galveston and it moved in a straight path upwards and to the side (I can't remember if it was right or left). Its cross section was like a perfectly level and symmetrical trapezoid and I had the feeling it might be a cylinder with a vertical axis and the top diameter about 20% smaller than the bottom diameter. I watched it about 3 or 4 minutes skeptically until I finally decided to get my camera to take a look through the zoom lens. By the time I got back with my camera I couldn't see the object. Its cross section was very small like an aspirin at arm's length or even smaller. I didn't have much of a reaction to the sighting other than casual interest like \"that sure is weird looking\"."],"Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.310518,+-94.793426(7218)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7218) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-94.793426","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"7218","Date Submitted":"06/10/2007 02:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/10/2007 02:00 UTC","Summary":"tapered cylinder or trapezoid very small in daylight","Object Shape":"Cylinder"}
