We looked up and to everyone astonishment we saw a huge fireball in the sky. It came out of the north western sky. it change directions a few time then came to a stop. It was easy to see that it had stopped because it was framed by a very large tree. It was a bright orange and yellow color. It sat there in the sky for a few seconds then shot off with a tremendous burst of speed. It went from that huge fireball to a small point of light in the blink of a eye. It had to be seen by o'hare airport or anyone who had a clear view of the western sky. I search the news today but their were no official reports???"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Chicago","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Date of the Event":"07/05/2009 12:00 UTC"}
