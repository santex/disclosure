I pointed the camera in a southernly direction, set the lens a 2X power and let the camera run for approximately 20-minutes. A day or two later I decided to view the film on a VCR and while running the film at half speed I discovered that I had taped numerous objects during that 20-minutes and have continued to do so ever since into the late 2000's. The majority of craft are either somewhat arrow shaped but I have videotaped saucer and skate board type objects all of which have very good to excellant definition. Some of which were shown on the History channels 'UFO hunters'. If anyone wants to see them I can either send them to UFO Stalker or e-mail them upon request. I am enclosing three video stills that might be of interest to UFO StalKer viewers Note: All the videos were filmed in the Village of Oak Creek, Sedona Arizona"],"Date Submitted":"03/30/2012 11:11 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.786835,+-111.778878(37007)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37007) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"01/13/2000 11:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"There were a number of craft of varied designs that I videotaped.
