Predict more to come. Welcome your represenatives to help clarify this anomaly","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt around the same time every evening for the last three days and on previous occasions the same glowing sphere makes a slow descent to horizon and when it gets close to the horizon a second glowing sphere pops up usually to the right of the object with the same pulsation glow of pinkish-red. Because of its higher intensity in color and brightness in comparisson to any other objects in the sky, I immediately was locked onto this object until it faded below the horizon and would periodically resurface until finally it did not do so again. I had a clear view of it for the entire duration of its flight. I would welcome any field investigators to join us in wittnessing this event. My digital camera would not show the target in the viewer, so unfortunately I dont have any images or footage. I am sure that it will appear again tomorrow and maybe again the next evening."],"Longitude":"-107.832625","Latitude":"32.217426","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Egg, Fireball, Oval, Sphere, Teardrop"}
