Moving from over the West Summerlin Mountains going East. I quickly got up to get a better view and thought these were a squad of helicopters going back to Nellis AFB. The more I looked the more it did not seem like helicopters. They were extremely high up in the air and had an Orange flicker solid light and kind of had a white hue light around it. It was a huge long pattern of a good 10+ orange lights traveling from West to East. There was a big gap between them and some of them traveled in pairs together. They all moved in a straight line that branched out a good 5 miles long. I quickly went to get my camera and the lights were gone. The lights disappeared before it would hit the center of Las Vegas valley"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"36.116375","City":"Las Vegas","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/15/2013 11:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"48166","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Fireball, Oval, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48166.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48166.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/16/2013 12:55 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Region":"Nevada","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around June 15th 2013"],"Summary":"Las Vegas Orange Lights 10+ Objects","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-115.248196"}
