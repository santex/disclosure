The day was sunny and the sky was clear with some clouds. I noticed something in the sky off to my left and it was just hovering there. I pointed it out to my wife as then a tree briefly obscured my vision. I figured if it was an airplane, the object would still be there. As we passed the tree the object was gone. I looked around to see where it was, and it was gone. Nowhere to be found. It just disappeared. The object was disc shaped with a dome on top. Its color was a glowing white color. My wife did not witness it because it was gone before i could point it out again."],"Date Submitted":"01/28/2012 03:50 UTC","City":"Cookeville","Summary":"Disc like Object","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Dome","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Cookeville","There were no other sightings in Cookeville on or around January 28th 2012"],"Longitude":"-85.494242","Region":"Tennessee","Log Number":"US-01282012-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35311.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
