I walked out to my car, looked up in the sky and I see a star-like object moving kind of slow toward the west. I called my dad who was inside to get him to come out and look at it. By the time he got outside, the object looked like it was going out of the atmosphere and it was gone. The object was glowing white and I could see just a little bit of red in it. I thought the object could be a satellite moving, but it clearly was not one because it was to far into the atmospere. there was also 2 planes that i could see in my vision. The lights on these planes were blinking like strobes. I was excited that I got to see my first UFO that i know of."],"Weather Factors":"Windy","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Baton Rouge","There were no other sightings in Baton Rouge on or around November 30th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/30/2010 06:30 UTC","Region":"Louisiana","Country":"United States"}
