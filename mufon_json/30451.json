It appeared to be over Tulsa, but not certain. As I watched it appeared to be moving in a zig zag pattern. It was partly cloudy and you could see some stars in the sky but in this area they couldn't be seen due to the clouds. After about 3 minutes it started ascending slowly. You could see the light enter the clouds and they began to glow around the object as it passed up through the clouds. Within a minute or so the object appeared to break through the clouds and you could see it slowly get smaller as it left but was still making the top of the clouds glow slightly. Within minutes of seeing this two jet aircraft of some kind flew in from the west. They were flying really fast for any aircraft I've seen in the area. You couldn't hear their engines until they were almost out of sight."]}
