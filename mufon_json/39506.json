I saw this brilliant light. At first I thought it was a star,but then it started to move. It traveled in a NE to SE direction. It was about 10,000 ft.high. I know this because I sky dive. I was looking for blinking lights which normal aircraft have but there were none. At that altitude you could hear the sound of a jet or a propellar. There was none.It was absolutely silent.
