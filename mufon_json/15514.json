Obscured by trees. My friend and I were walking north on Avenue G at intersection of 42nd street. Observed a large object falling from the sky with a long bright red trail, moving far too slow to be a comet or meteor (conjecture). When we arrived at our destination, a coffee shop a few blocks away, I asked if anyone there had observed the object. One girl came rushing over and said she was the only person present who saw it. Said she was glad someone else saw it, because she thought she might just have imagined it. I can see why she would have thought that. It looked like something out of an old black and white sci-fi flick."],"Case Number":"15514","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
