I went outside and could see a small craft flying above, it had square lights all around the perimeter of the object. This was in Englewood, CO in the Spring of 1976. The object made no noise and traveled north over Denver, I could see it for about 5 minutes before it went out of sight. It appeared very close when I first saw it, and looked like it was only about 30 feet in diameter. It looked like it was flying about 100 to 150 feet high and was only a half a block away when I first saw it. I could hardly believe what I saw and tried to explain it as something familiar, like an airplane, but it was not an airplane. I don't know what it was."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/31/1976 10:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.551791,+-105.780367(13273)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13273) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/31/1976 10:30 UTC","Latitude":"39.551791","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"13273","Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States"}
