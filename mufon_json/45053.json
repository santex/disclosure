Later that same night, December 31, 2012, at around 11:10 PM, I went outside to sit on my lanai. ���I looked up and saw approximately 5 to 7 of these same orangish-red, ball shaped lights moving across the sky, but these moved in a strange formation.������It took approximately 3 minutes for the formation to disappear behind a large cloud bank. ���I could not determine if the formation was a single large object with multiple lights or multiple objects. ���My impression was that it was both.��� When I first saw the formation, I immediately went into the house to get my camera. ���I was able to capture video footage of the lights as well as a second video of another, single, light that appeared moments after the formation was lost to the clouds. ���This second���single light followed the same flight path as the formation, also disappearing into the same cloud bank. ������ Both the formation and the second single light moved steadily in a north-westerly direction. ���They neither decended nor ascended, but moved in steadily and horizontally at about half the speed of commercial aircraft. They all appeared to have controlled flight - though it seemed more like gliding. ��� I did not see anything emerge from the clouds, perhaps because the bank was very large. ���I could not see a glow or reflection through the clouds. ���They made no sound I could hear. There was no wind. The first video I took is of the formation. The second is of the single object that followed it. I also have a still taken through the screen of my lanai. Looking closly, you can make out the brighter lights of the formation as opposed to the pieces of dust that appear on the close up of the screen itself. The shakiness in the video is all me. The lights moved steadily through the sky."],"Log Number":"US-01062013-0005","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
