They were moving slowly but in the same direction and at the same speed, one in front of the other. They seemed higher in the sky than the airplanes that were flashing lights in other parts of the sky, but the orbs were brighter and bigger. I watched for a minute or two and then ran in the house to show my daughter. They were still in the sky when we came back out, still moving slowly at the same speed. As we watched, the first orb started to fade and then disappeared. Then the second orb started to fade and disappeared. The entire incident was probably under 10 minutes. The orbs were in the south western sky maybe 30 degrees from the horizon. They moved in an eastern direction. I have never seen anything like this in the sky before. I thought it might be the private space craft but that was delayed so no idea what it was that I saw."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38349.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38349.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"Two orange glowing orbs in southwest sky moving together at the same speed in eastward direction closest faded and disappeared then second faded and disappeared.","Region":"New York","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Cherry Valley","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.371989,+-97.558225(38349)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38349) map </A>"}
