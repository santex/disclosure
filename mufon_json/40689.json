{"Summary":"Strange pattern of lights viewed hovering while driving down a road.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was riding with my mother to take my niece home when I happened to look out the passenger window when I saw lights. I always do this automatically since its normally an airplane or a helicopter. This didn't appear to be either though, as it appeared to not be moving at all and had a strange pattern of lights, almost like a triangle but with a line coming out the top. I couldn't stop thinking about it. When I first saw the object, I immediately thought it was a helicopter of some kind, or a plane, but when it was just hovering, I knew something was off. It appeared to not make a noise, since my mother didn't see it at all, but I couldn't tell because of the music in the car. I was a little panicky when I realized that it most likely wasn't an airplane or a helicopter, but kept it to myself. We lost sight of the object not very long afterwards since we were continuing to drive. On our way back, I did look for the object, but it was gone, no trace of it anywhere in the distance."],"Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07112012-0002","Sighting Duration":"00:01:03","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40689.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40689.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.245809,+-77.408581(40689)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40689) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-77.408581","Region":"Virginia","Latitude":"37.245809","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"07/11/2012 01:11 UTC","Case Number":"40689","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Colonial Heights","There were no other sightings in Colonial Heights on or around July 10th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Triangle, Other, Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/10/2012 10:30 UTC","City":"Colonial Heights","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
