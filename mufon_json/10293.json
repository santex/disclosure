Tonight we saw something different. A very large oval like object with a very large bright white light traveled from the west southwest at a high rate of speed. This was not a plane, nor was it a shooting star. When the light came over in a more clearer area the light faded out to an orangelike dim color and then it just vanished. By the way, we saw 7 star like objects tonight. These star like objects are white and floresent white in color and travel across the sky at vey high rate of speeds. The objects do not appear to be traveling in groups as you can see sometimes 3 at once and they are not moving in the same direction or pattern. We have been able to see these objects with the naked eye. They do not record well with the digital camera that I have. Surely, we are not the only people who have seen these objects."],"Date Submitted":"04/12/2008 08:54 UTC","Longitude":"-94.357898","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Marshall","There were no other sightings in Marshall on or around April 12th 2008"],"Summary":"Large white slightly rounded sphere like object traveling southwest.","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.551931,+-94.357898(10293)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10293) map </A>","Latitude":"32.551931","Source":"MUFON"}
