When I awoke, I was unaware of where I was or what was happening. After a few seconds, I realized I was outside of my house and the window was open. I hurriedly reentered the house through the window and spent the rest of the night in an uneasy slumber. I wanted to make a note of this event because I have never had any past experiences with 'sleep walking', even for short distances. I also have never had any experiences with UFO sightings (and I grew up and live in the country where star gazing and night viewing was an everyday occurrence) so I don't believe in them, however, this incident was beyond 'strange' for me as nothing like this has ever happen like this before or since then. I have no recollection of the event whatsoever."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Tennessee"}
