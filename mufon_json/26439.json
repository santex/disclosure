I looked up and saw what looked like a very bright star, it was still then started moving to the east. it went a pretty long distance then did big a U-turn as it finished the turn it vanished not to be seen again. the sighting lasted for around 10-15 seconds. Our reaction was like \"what in the hell\" we started laughing because it just blew our minds. how could something be still start moving at a high rate of speed do this huge turn then just vanish as soon as it finishes the turn."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.23203,+-111.96857(26439)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26439) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","City":"Ogden"}
