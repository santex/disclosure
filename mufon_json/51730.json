Both the other witness and my sister were on the multi use path behind my mother's house in Mill Valley. I have not interviewed my sister as to all the details but do believe she is a credible witness. She took a number of low resolution pictures on her phone camera, one of which is a classic boomerang shape. She knows about airplanes and helicopters, because my dad was in the military and both of us are avid sky watchers."],"Latitude":"37.917077","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Mill Valley","Date of the Event":"10/18/2013 07:32 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51730.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51730_submitter_file1__1018131932a0001.jpeg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51730.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.521701","Summary":"Bright light in sky caught my sister's attention","Object Features":"None"}
