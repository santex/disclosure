{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was leaving my apartment and looked up. I noticed an odd set of lights that at first I thought was possibly a Coast Guard helicopter. There was no sound. no FAA lights. I was close enough to hear if it was a helicopter. The object appeared as three or more cubes of different colors, rotating in different directions around a central red sphere. There was a multi-color glow that grew and shrank around the entire object. It moved very slowly to the northwest for 30-45 seconds. It ascended slightly, grew smaller and brighter, picked up its speed, flashed and blinked out of existence."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"24.931384","Summary":"A sphere with 3 cubes rotating in opposite directions around the sphere.","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Islamorada","There was one other sighting in Islamorada on or around August 2nd 2013"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-11262013-0015","City":"Islamorada","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52444.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52444.html"],"Longitude":"-80.624386","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=24.931384,+-80.624386(52444)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52444) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/02/2013 10:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/26/2013 03:30 UTC","Case Number":"52444"}
