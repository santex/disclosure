It had no lights, no noise and no mass.It looked as if a cookie cutter had stamped a Triangle shape out of the clouds.I kept looking at it to figure if this was a natural occurrence, but it was too perfect a shape. It was slightly rounded at the nose, the two sides were longer and the rear was a bit shorter.As I watched, the shape moved WITH the cloud formation without loosing shape. I could see through it , it was as if something was there, but could not be seen. No lights, no sound , no structure to it. I watched as it continued to move to the north with the clouds, never loosing shape. I stopped looking when it passed behind some trees and houses. I can only guess at how large it was, the distance and altitude. I would guess it was more than two miles away. I would guess it was larger than an aircraft carrier and at least 10to15 thousand feet in altitude. There were no planes in the area. This is along a commercial flight path for smaller jets like 737 and 767's. The larger jets move higher at 35 thousand feet toward the east. At this time of night ,planes go from east to west or east to north depending on what airport they are going to. This concludes my report."],"Case Number":"49203","Latitude":"36.834467"}
