Continued to watch assuming the light was a satellite and would simply continue in a straight line across the sky towards the north. The light continued at same speed & general direction but slowly did a large S shaped turn before fading out. I thought this was very odd as satellites move in straight lines. Total time about 2 minutes. This is the first time I have ever seen something odd like this in the night sky."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Alaska","Case Number":"13227","Date Submitted":"10/24/2008 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13227.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13227.html"],"Summary":"Light in NNE sky, slowly moving straight line north, then slowly did an \"S\" track & faded out","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=61.219596,+-149.891568(13227)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13227) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-10252008-0011","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
