I'm in Southwest Minnesota. It occurred around 9:30 pm, on October 27th. I had seen solid white sphere about an half hour before this sighting and submitted a report, the same night. (But is no longer up on the MUFON Map) Anyway, I decided to step out side to scan the skies again. And to my surprise, seen the blinking star in the Southern sky. It would blink for 15 t0 20 seconds and then the sky would go black in that spot. It appeared to move slightly to the left or the right of its position. While viewing the \"flashing star\", I wondered if this had any connection to the solid white sphere that I had seen earlier. Was thrilled to seem so much activity in one night."],"Region":"Minnesota","Summary":"Blinking Star-Like","Log Number":"US-10302010-0007","Date Submitted":"10/30/2010 11:00 UTC","Case Number":"26218","Date of the Event":"10/27/2010 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
