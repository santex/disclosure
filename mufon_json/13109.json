It was a very clear blue sky. The moon was still visible. I noticed that there was something else in my view while I was searching for the moon in one of my photos. I snapped the picture. I jokingly said to my family that I had just taken a picture of a UFO. Later after I uploaded the pictures I realized it was somewhat strange looking. It does not look like a plane, or cloud to me. The object was very small and far away. It was small in comparison to the moon. If you were looking at the moon, it was to the left of the moon. I will attach several pictures. The first is the object uncropped. The file might be large, but is clearer to see if you zoom in. The second is the image cropped and closer. The last is a picture of the moon. The pictures were taken at about the same zoom level.
