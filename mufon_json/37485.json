I pulled over and got out my car and started staring. Other cars passed by and slowed down and i tried to take pictures but they didn't come out well. I kept just observing objects and some flew in odd patterns, two even almost seemed to touch then break away and fly in patterns that planes just arent capable of. I watched until I couldn't see them anymore. After that I called 911 and reported the incident, they told me they had received similar calls right before mine."],"Date Submitted":"04/15/2012 06:33 UTC","Log Number":"US-04152012-0004","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
