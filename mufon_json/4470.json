{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsJust seeiing some friends off from our house when we saw the strange circules around the full moon (this happened before Christmas 2005.) Then to day downloaded the picures to Fireworks to look at them and print them out. It was then that I noticed this strange object in two of the four pictures, I thought it was fluff of the lens but it is only on two pictures and no others and the aspect is different in each of them. What is it? A Satalight! or something else!!!!"],"Latitude":"52.412952","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.412952,+-1.514063(4470)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4470) map </A>","Longitude":"-1.514063","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Coventry","There were no other sightings in Coventry on or around November 30th 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4470.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4470_submitter_file1__DSCF0790.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4470_submitter_file2__DSCF0791.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4470_submitter_file3__DSCF0793.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4470.html"],"Case Number":"4470","Region":"England","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/30/2005 12:00 UTC","Country":"United Kingdom","Tags":"City","Log Number":"GB-02222006-0002","Date Submitted":"11/30/2005 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Chevron","Summary":"During a Full Moon.
