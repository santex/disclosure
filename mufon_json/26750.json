I was sitting in a car waiting on a friend facing west staring at the sky and saw a bright sphere hovering about 5 miles away (near West Portsmouth, Ohio) at a low altitude; then the sphere suddenly plummeted out of the sky (almost like a shooting star) then completely vanished. Not more than 60 seconds later an aircraft coming from the east flew in the direction of the unidentified object and circled the surrounding area for about 4 minutes and then also vanished. This plane was very large with flashing lights, but was definitely not a commercial airliner. About 2 minutes later three more aircrafts also coming from the east headed in the same direction and surveyed the area. Not long after that a total of six additional planes came from various directions to the same area. After about 15 minutes in total, there were no more flashing lights from the planes and the sky was clear."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.991644","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.734743,+-82.991644(26750)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26750) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"26750","Latitude":"38.734743","Date of the Event":"11/26/2010 06:00 UTC","City":"Portsmouth","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-11272010-0002","Date Submitted":"11/27/2010 01:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26750.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26750.html"],"Region":"Ohio","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"A spherical object at a low altitude that hovered in the air then fell from the sky and vanished followed by a total of 10 planes."}
