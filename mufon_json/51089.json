I went outside and saw a bright light in the sky. I knew it was not a star due to the shape, the black in the center and the blinking red and blue lights at the tips. first looked like a sphere but was a triangle. lights at 2 bottom tips. It was swaying back and forth from left to right slowly. Wasn't going anywhere so it wasn't a plane. My sister in Kansas also witnessed this from her home. Neighbors, and friends also saw this object. as the sky got darker, it got dimmer. So that rules out a star and a plane. Fighter jets were flying towards it and around it. was reported to media channels KTIV channel 4 and KCAU channel 9 in Sioux city but nothing was reported. Had no sound what so ever. I believe it is a UFO (coincides with other sightings everyday this month from all over the world. from Australia to Ireland, from Canada to Peru. we are not alone."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Log Number":"US-09252013-0029","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51089.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51089.html"],"Object Features":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in South Sioux City","There were no other sightings in South Sioux City on or around September 25th 2013"],"Longitude":"-96.414982","Region":"Nebraska","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"sphere/triangle shape stationary blinking red/blue lights, black center lightly swinging back and forth","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/25/2013 11:40 UTC","City":"South Sioux City","Date of the Event":"09/25/2013 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"42.458902","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
