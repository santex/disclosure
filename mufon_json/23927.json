Out of the corner of my eye i noticed something moving across the sky and assumed it was a shooting star. After looking at it directly i realized it was an extremely bright blue circle, and much much bigger than a shooting star would have been. It moved straight across the sky at a steady pace moving faster than an airplane at the same altitude would've been. It's hard describe the size since it was up so high, but from that distance it was about the size of a soccer ball. Up close it would obviously be much bigger. Right when i saw it I knew it was something unusual and started shouting for the other two to look. By the time they turned around it was gone because the opening in the trees that i saw it through isn't very big. It was behind the trees and gone by the time they looked."]}
