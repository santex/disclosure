This item is definitely rectangular in shape and it does not look like something that can fly let alone just hover in mid air. The reason I don���t think it is moving is that it appears to have a small cloud sitting in front of the end on the left. The bottom portion, which appears to be about ��� of it is not she same color as the top section, it seems to be a very light tan or a shade of yellow. It looks to me like the bottom section is wrapped in a light cloud, ant that cloud going out to the left seems to be coming from the unit somehow. Looking carefully, the out line of the bottom is quit clear, as are the corners, and there seems to be a darker shade of tan just below the brown on what I have come to call the front, perhaps that is closer to the color of the lower section. Just above the white it looks to me like there is a row of openings running the full length of the side. It may just be that I am seeing something I want to see. I am sure you people have the tools and expertise to determine that. Directly below the cloud and towards the bottom of the picture you will notice a black dot. When that is enlarged several times you will notice it has a halo of white cloud around it in perfect proportions all around it Again I am not sure that it is anything worth pointing out but I did anyhow. I would like if you could determine if it is just a speck of dirt or something to do with the main item. Going down even further, and below the vein of coal, there is a very small, elongated item that is hardly noticeable and can only be seen when the photo is expanded several times, it almost looks like a small twig; however, when it is expanded several times there appears to be that same white substance running the full length on both sides, There are several very white lines extending out a an angle on both sides. They do not extend very far and they also cross each other in pairs at the ends. They almost look like beams of light, again only speculation. Looking to the far right at about the same level as the star of the picture There is what appears to be 2 sides of a rectangle about the same color as the top of the main craft. This is so faint that one has to enlarge the photo several times to see it, and even then you have to look carefully. Above that there is a white item with a black halo round it in perfect proportions, just the exact opposite to the one below the craft. In the upper right corner you can see two l8ines that look like jet trails or meteorites falling. Problem is they look like they are moving in opp0osite directions. I have enlarged them several time and I believe they are just breaks in the cloud, but it would be worth a professional checking them out. Just below the ���jet trail��� on the right you will notice a very small black dot, I thought it was just a speck of dirt, but when I enlarged it several times it looks like a piece of metal. The upper right corner is at 90 degrees. The top and right sides are very straight the bottom seems to be cut in a certain way as to fit something, The left side looks like it was straight and formed a 90 degree corner at the top; however, the left corner and part of the side appears like it has been broken off something. I took this photo near Drumheller Alberta sometime in the summer of either 95 or 97, I cant remember which, it has been sitting in my junk photo drawer since the. I don���t know what all those white spots are and I am not going to speculate, but they are not on any of the other pictures on that roll of film. I don���t remember what I had for a camera at the time but you can be assured it wasn���t an expensive one. I did not take the picture because of the item in the sky, but rather, I was interested in that vein of coal you see running across the whole width of the picture. I am not very good at guessing distances but if it will help, I was probably 30 or 40 feet from that vein of coal. The crest of the hill is probably about 23 to 30 feet beyond that, and that weeds are probably about 3 feet high. I don���t know the width of ground that I captured but I am sure you have ways of determining. Because I was not aware of this craft in the sky I had no reactions toward it."],"Region":"Alberta","Longitude":"-112.707074","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Drumheller","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/05/2013 06:26 UTC","Log Number":"CA-04052013-0012"}
