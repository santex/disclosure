{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were doing our morning hot tub ritual when we noticed a bright white light moving across the sky. We see satellites all the time and thought nothing of it till it stopped and headed in the reverse direction. It stopped again and hovered a moment. Then it started moving in a circular motion. Then it began to zig zag, looked like a firefly moving on my video tape. It moved as if it was playing a game back and forth in mutiple directions. Satellites do not do this. Have seen this once before out here, but I was alone and no camera. This time my husband and I both saw and video taped it. This went on until we then noticed the second shape that was just like it. In the distance. This went on until dawn and even after the sun came up and all stars were no longer visible these two objects were. The kids woke up and I had to come in and when I returned they were gone when we came back out. My tape is 8mm so I cannot email it unfortunately."],"City":"Matagorda","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Matagorda","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"14829","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Latitude":"28.695618","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14829.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14829.html"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/08/2009 06:15 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like, Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.695618,+-95.96653(14829)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14829) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/08/2009 06:15 UTC","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-01082009-0008","Summary":"Comet like, bright white, looked like a firefly.","Longitude":"-95.96653"}
