{"Object Features":"None, Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting Detailsmy father was outside in the back yard.i was in the basement.he openend the door and told me to hurry and come outside.i ran outside and he was pointing to the sky.i was amazed at what we were looking at.they were fying so smoothly heading north.i ran downstairs to the basement to get my camera.when i got back they all went into the clouds.they were white in color,most likely because the sun light was reflecting from them.they all diseappered in the clouds and the clouds were headed southeast.but we were able to see 2 of them in the clouds.they stopped and were hovering.during all this i had a huge smile on me.i always believed in ufos.after a few seconds in the clouds one ufo came down out of the cloud and was still hovering.it stayed there.then we see a airline jet coming from north headed south towards the ufo.then the ufo goes back in the cloud.10 seconds after the plane past the ufo comes out of the cloud and starts heading north.the others i guess have gone in another direction.most likely south east with the clouds because we couldnt find them anymore.so the one we see is headed north and goes into a another cloud and stays there for a few minutes but we cant see it nomore because the clouds are more thick now.it appears from the clouds again and keeps going north.now the sky is full of thick clouds.we stayed maybe 20 min looking but nothing.i go back inside.10 min my father calls me again and points to the sky to show me a airplane that has that big radar on it.it was flying around the area then it flew out of site.and 5min after that plane showed up,my father told me that 4 f-16 flew through the area.i guess they were looking for the ufos.others had to see what we saw,thats why the f-16 were flying around with the other plane.i took 8 photos total but only 1 has the ufos in it.maybe the others have something to but i cant find nothing.i found 2 ligths in the photo above the trees inthe clouds.you have to zoom in on the photo.i also discovered 2 more objects in the photo,1 in the left and 1 all the way on top of the photo,a total of 4 objects.remember to zoom.enjoy."],"Longitude":"-73.88013","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"there were about 8 or 10 ufos in the sky!!!","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"New York","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-09222007-0007","Case Number":"7971","Date of the Event":"09/09/2007 04:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.698443,+-73.88013(7971)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7971) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/09/2007 04:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.698443","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There was one other sighting in New York on or around September 9th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"New York","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7971.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7971_submitter_file1__ufos9-9-07004.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7971.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
