After a phone call from a friend I was stargazing and noticed one of the stars changing colors. Knowing that this wasn't natural I continued to follow it and it began to move and change colors. It started moving in a circular, clockwise pattern and then stopped for about five minutes until it began moving backwards and forwards on one straight path. It then broke off into three shapes that formed a triangle formation and followed the same straight path. After that the shape re-consolidated itself and began the circular pattern. It then shot off at high speed, leaving behind a bright purple trail that then slowly dissipated after about thirty seconds. It is to be noted I also saw two shooting stars that were bright green in the same area of the sky."],"Longitude":"-89.018675"}
