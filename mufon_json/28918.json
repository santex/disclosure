I looked up and noticed a group of 8-10 white and slightly orangish lights. They resembled the size of a typical airplane lights you usually see in the night sky, and about the same average distance away, just a little brighter. At first I thought they were stars, but they were so unfamiliar and oddly clustered. There was a main sort of U shape formation the lights appeared to be in, with 2 lights at it's west flank that were moving slowly, and would sporadically flicker. My son who is 10 years old saw it as well. I was so confused, I didn't understand what I was seeing, it was incredible. We watched this happen for about 10 seconds, then in a blink of an eye, they disappeared."],"Log Number":"US-05022011-0017","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.340896"}
