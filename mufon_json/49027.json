The object traveled from the southwest to the northeast in a straight line pattern, the triangle object intersected with the jet with the jet being above it, looking at this, the triangle object was 3X bigger then the jet, could be that the jet was much higher up then the object, watched it till it was out of sight, told my husband about it when he came home from work, he said it was probably a stealth fighter, so I looked up \"stealth fighter at night\" on the internet and looked at some video clips, I can say NO it was not a stealth fighter."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Black Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49027.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49027.html"]}
