As we walked across the parking lot someone yelled to me to look up in the western sky and tell them what the hell they were seeing. Looking up I saw a gold, spikey, shaped ball coming towards us at app. 1000 ft. Another worker came up and she and I saw the object turn towards the southeast and accelerate very quickly. Reaching our location and now being ball shaped( looking at it from the side) the goldish blue light suddenly disappeared and two tiny white lights appeared to flash on and off taking only a couple of seconds to do so. After that it was gone from our sight. The weather at the time was clear with numerous stars being seen. Temperature about 10 degrees. Object was seen by 3 people. Duration app. 30 sec. Feelings were more of curiousity than anything else."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27755.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27755.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/08/2011 11:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.458332,+-87.50314(27755)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27755) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Kewaunee","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Wisconsin","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Gold ball at 1000 ft traveling towards Lake Michigan","Log Number":"US-02102011-0006"}
