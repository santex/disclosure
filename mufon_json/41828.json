The next morning i woke up and went to the bathroom to find an omega shaped metallic object in my left arm. i pulled it out and put it in a brand new ziplock baggy then placed away from any hot lamps in my hat with wallet over top of it. the following morning i woke up to find that the bag remained but had a little crescent shaped burn in the conrner of the bag and the object was missing. i still have the bag and have been unable to reproduce the type of cut on the bag. The only people in the house at the time were my parenst and sister and they were all asleep. The only one i showed the object to was my father whom is very much a sceptic. i asked if anyone tampered with it and none had. I would be willing to go under lie detection to validify the contents of my story. i also still have the bag the object was previously in."],"Case Number":"41828","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.343133,+-75.077636(41828)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41828) map </A>","Longitude":"-75.077636","City":"Ocean City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Log Number":"US-08182012-0008","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/18/2012 10:53 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/29/2011 12:00 UTC","Region":"Maryland"}
