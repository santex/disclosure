Strange events with military happen there and there isnt supposed to be any military there. I had a friend that said he saw strange lights above the northern sector every night and I need to come check it out. He said it was wild. I went out there many nights. Each night was different. The closest one came was maybe 500 feet. They made no sound. Flashed different ways. It's almost as they were made of magnets electricity and water. They would sit and flash then zip across the sky and I seen a bunch of them form real quick and dissappear! I havn't been out there looking in a long time but I am sure something strange is going on there."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
