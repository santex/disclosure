I watched it for approximately 5 min until the hospital blocked my view."],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Farmington","There were no other sightings in Farmington on or around March 13th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29704.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29704.html"]}
