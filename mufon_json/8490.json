It has no discernible lines or features. Was not a helicopter. Was not an aircraft with wings and fuselage. Just a quick moving \"dot\". I watched it as it went into clouds and out and it changed tone to darker because of the shadow effect of clouds. The duration was about 1- 2 minutes until it disappeared in the western sky. I estimate it was travelling at sub-sonic speed but quickly. I had plenty of time to realize there were no features describing a helicopter or aircraft. There is an international airport south of Edmonton however, as I said, it had no features of an aircraft. It probably was, but I have seen countless many aircraft in the distance in the skies and under many circumstances and they all are obviously planes or helicopters."],"trends":["There have been 70 other sightings in Edmonton","There were no other sightings in Edmonton on or around August 4th 2002"],"Log Number":"CA-11272007-0010","Case Number":"8490"}
