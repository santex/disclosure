(medfield is under several flight paths of planes flying in and out of logan int'l airport in boston as well as nearby norwood airport that handles executive jets so i know very well how regular aircraft look and sound). we watched it cruise towards mt. nebo yet as the single light began to pass in front of a cloud illuminated by the moonlight, it seemed to disappear into the night, likely just dropping out of visibility. ecstatic euphoria is the best way to describe the feeling i was experiencing, my girlfriend on the other hand just shrugged it off as a ufo sighting... note: at no time did we actually see what the lights were coming out of. the three bright white lights looked like spotlights but without beams coming out of them, more like massive floodlights. their brilliance made it impossible to see the craft. when the white lights shut off the the pulsing red light appeared, it was still difficult to determine what it was even with near full moon conditions (the craft was in between us and the moon so were seeing the \"darkside\" of the it). i had my cellphone with me that is fully capable of taking good quality pictures and videos yet i was so awestruck by what i was seeing that i didn't even think of filming it at the time, a regret i will hold for a long time. the following morning a us coast guard jayhawk helicopter buzzed over my house (less than a mile from the sighting) at low altitude. this is unheard of this far inland and distant from any bases. there are no air force bases or other military airfields within the immediate area. the only military installations are the natick army labs, eight miles north of town, but they are situated in an urban setting, an unlikely place for testing. my friend who does not believe extraterrestrials are manning ufos concluded\\theorizes that it must have come from the labs; however, this is usually the explanation for strange activity (i.e. the dover demon) in the area. earlier this summer, two friends of mine, brothers in fact, stepped out for a smoke one evening in neighboring norfolk, ma. they observed near identical lights and erratic, steady movements yet they could actually see that it was a very large black triangle. i tried to encourage them to report it but they didn't feel comfortable talking about it and seemed to be spooked out, a feeling i now share with them. this is not my first sighting."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Medfield","There were no other sightings in Medfield on or around"],"Date Submitted":"08/11/2009 02:43 UTC","City":"Medfield","Summary":"Assumed Black Triangle lights and \"gracefully erratic\" movements viewed over the Boston suburb of Medfield, Massachusetts. 3 bright white lights, then just a single pulsing red light.","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"42.195723","Case Number":"18600","Object Features":"Unknown"}
