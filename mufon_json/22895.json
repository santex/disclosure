It was hovering directly in front of our car, appearing to be several kilometers in the air and I don't know how far away. I wasn't able to compartmentalize the image well because as soon as I started staring at it, it seemed to zoom off into distance in a split second. It startled me because I had instantly realized that I was seeing something very bizzare, and I asked my boyfriend, \"Did you see that?\" And he said, \"Yes, what in the world was it, a comet?\" I responded,\"Um, I think that was a UFO!\" And he replied, \"I think you're right, because a comet wouldn't have disappeared like that!\" The end."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-83.819026","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
