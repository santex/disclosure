No unusual start-stop motions, but they do seem appear from nowhere and end the same way. They seem to flicker on, then off. Movement is in a straight line - but not a satellite or a plane. Wanted to report because it has been happening often; 2-3 times every night for the last 3 nights."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"26.966735","Log Number":"US-12072010-0007","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/30/2010 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.966735,+-82.349945(26887)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26887) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/07/2010 07:51 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Englewood","Summary":"Lemon Bay Satellites?","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26887.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26887.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Englewood","There were no other sightings in Englewood on or around November 30th 2010"]}
