I was traveling West. It was a clear, dry, hot night. There were stars in the sky. I was watching the road in front of me when out of nowhere, low in the sky appeared a bright green glowing ball which shot in a straight line at about a 60 degree angle down to the ground. It had a slight haze around it and had a very faint, very short tail. The light appeared in the southwest sky. It was only visible for about two seconds. It was much larger than any shooting star. It looked like someone shot a flare gun from the sky to the earth. It was the color of a green traffic light. I immediately thought it was a UFO because it traveled so fast and in straight line. I was amazed at the size and intensity of the object. If it was a meteor it would have wiped out a city. I lost sight of it at the horizon line. It looked liked it would have made contact with the ground."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Bright green fireball shoots to the ground over Azle, Texas.","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Azle","There were no other sightings in Azle on or around June 19th 2009"],"Case Number":"17547","Date Submitted":"06/19/2009 02:25 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","Log Number":"US-06192009-0007","Longitude":"-97.539906","Source":"MUFON"}
