{"Summary":"like a fake star","divs":["Sighting DetailsLabor day evening. I had just pulled into my boyfriends driveway. It was around 9pm to 9:30pm. I got out of the car and glanced to the south-ish direction at Scorpius. I am a Scorpio so I tend to look, and Anteres seemed weird. very bright and white, anteres is always red. I found it weird and went inside the basement area to see my boyfriend. He was not there. A minute or so later I stepped back out into the driveway to make a call on my cellphone when I saw the star that should have been anteres star moving in an upward and easterly direction. I about fell down. It only lasted a few seconds. The star is still present. On the 8th at around 3 am I saw the star sitting still in the sky. But it was not were it should have been. It was sitting back in the place anteres had been. I don't know if it is a satellite but it's very bright. Bright like the space station is bright."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.500567,+-99.894203(19168)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19168) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.500567","Date Submitted":"09/08/2009 11:48 UTC","Region":"Nebraska","Log Number":"US-09082009-0041","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19168.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19168.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"19168","trends":[],"Longitude":"-99.894203","Date of the Event":"09/06/2009 09:15 UTC"}
