As we all watched the star became dimmer and dimmer until it vanished from sight. Approximately five minutes later, it re-appeared. Looking through binoculars I was able to discern, that instead of one source of light for that star, there in fact three white orbs in a horizontal configuration. One of my grandsons observed three white orbs move in a northerly position and two went up \"very fast\" while the other went downward also very fast. My grandsons were extremely excited and very curious as to what they had all just witnessed."],"Date Submitted":"09/23/2008 07:30 UTC","Latitude":"35.46896","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14013","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-97.515418","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.46896,+-97.515418(14013)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14013) map </A>","City":"Oklahoma City"}
