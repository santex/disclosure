I took my camera and shot some pictures between 8:15 and 8:44PM I used a manual option with f4:20sec. I see the pictures with one color in each corner but was not the same when I used my binoculars. It was more flashy in colors, .... I think 20sec exposure time mixed the real colors. I have 11 pictures (high resolution) and I'll try to upload them. Let me know if this is a real UFO event or are known stars that happens to be in that formation at that time SW from my home.
