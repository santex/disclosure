My son and I ran up the driveway to where the others were and looked to the East....There they were...the one closest to the North was smaller, farther away but was flashing colors and the one more to the South was bigger and I could really see the colors....red, orange, blue and green....Both objects were flashing ...My daughter thought they may be signaling one another... I ran inside to get more jackets because three of us ran out without one... When I came back out the objects were still there flashing..but getting smaller aka farther away...We were so excited, we watched for about 10 or more minutes and then the cold drove us inside....Both objects were still visible when we went in.... I came directly to computer to tell the sighting...:)"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.320326,+-88.345485(52312)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52312) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Morris Chapel","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52312.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52312.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/20/2013 12:11 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
