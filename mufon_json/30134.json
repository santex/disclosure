{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsSaw something flying through the sky on Saturday, July 9, 2011 that I did not recognize. It was early afternoon and it flew a bit above the horizon, slowly through the clouds. I say slowly, but I guess that's hard to determine. It covered a lot of ground, in a relatively short time. I could easily follow it as I was driving north on I-75 sometime between 2 and 3 PM. Looked like nothing I've seen flying before. Very angular and gray looking, kind of rectangle in shape, wasn't small either. It moved very precisely, for lack of a better term. It was flying East."],"Summary":"Angular looking, gray in color.
