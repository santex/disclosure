{"Object Features":"Wings","Longitude":"-76.839496","Date of the Event":"08/15/2008 04:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking out the trash and I happened to look up at the sky, and I saw this flying triangle. It had three white lights and had a silvery-grey or black body(the sun glare was preventing me from mostly seeing the body of the thing)and was making sharp turns worthy of an F-22 Raptor jet. However, this craft looked more like a B-2 or the shape of the alleged Aurora hypersonic airplane. After around a half-minute, it stopped making those turns and started to move away at a very fast speed."],"Tags":"City","City":"Laurel","Date Submitted":"08/15/2008 04:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","Summary":"Silver flying triangle.","Log Number":"US-04182009-0007","Case Number":"16567","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"Maryland","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.105765,+-76.839496(16567)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16567) map </A>","Latitude":"39.105765","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16567.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16567.html"],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Laurel","There were no other sightings in Laurel on or around August 15th 2008"]}
