I then looked outside with binoculars and saw the orb he was talking about. It was stationery and had a red lit-up area on the interior, lower left side. I immediately thought \"high altitude balloon\" but it was perfectly round, no tear-drop shape like all I've seen before. It started \"dropping\" small lighted pieces of itself, then larger worm-like, undulating pieces which floated and very slowly descended, all the time twisting and tumbling. I watched 3 of these things fall from it, then they disappeared. After watching the large orb for 30 minutes through binoculars, and after I had come inside the house for 5 minutes, when I went back outside it was MUCH smaller and was moving to the north and slowly descending. After 5 more minutes of watching, it disappeared completely from sight."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-09182011-0010","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"09/18/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"09/18/2011 02:31 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-111.827052","City":"Mesa","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31881.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31881.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
