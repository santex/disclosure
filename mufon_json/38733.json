I live within ten miles of a major airport. Then I realized that it wasn't on any flight path I am used to seeing. I was expecting to see the usual signs of an aircraft as it cleared the cloud cover. But once it cleared it stayed the same. It appeared as a flame like light with a geometric red aura that resembled a snowflake. Once it cleared the cloud cover it appeared to stop mid air, paused then made 90 degree change of direction headed what I think was north then accelerated at a rate of speed that I have never seen before( extremely fast ). The skies were clear of air craft for about two minutes and then I heard what sounded like fast moving jets. Shortly after I heard what sounded like jets ( about two minutes ) the normal air traffic I am used to seeing over my house continued. Like I said the flight paths I am used to seeing are very consistent and this was completely out of the usual."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/01/2012 10:45 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"38733","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","City":"Charlotte","Object Shape":"Fireball","Latitude":"35.090868","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Charlotte","There were 7 other sightings in Charlotte on or around June 1st 2012"],"Log Number":"US-06012012-0022","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Flame like light with geometric red aura that resembled a snowflake","Longitude":"-80.99135","Date Submitted":"06/01/2012 11:54 UTC"}
