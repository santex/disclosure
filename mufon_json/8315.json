men had met a man who called himself gary and we lived at the ymca kansas city kansas that at that time rented rooms. gary said he had walked across the desert from california and was guided to kansas city kansas by a mother ship and every night gary would go to the roof and attempt to show us ufo's and gary was always dressed in a flak jacketand a crew cut that looked like he came out of world war ii. one night me and three of my friends along with gary went in my car to see if we could spot a ufo and gary kept pointing to the sky and said there is the mother ship. somehow i managed to be in the country either in western wyandotte county ks or eastern leavenworth county ks and somehow we ended up in a desolate location. i remember looking and next to my car to the left in the air was an airplane as i would describe as out of world war ii suspended in the air all lights off and the next thing i remember is that the plane(object) was to the right of my car looking directly at us in the air and then was above the car for how long i don't know as i must have lost tract of time and finally was facing us over a tree looking directly at the car and then finally was back in the same position to the left. the plane then ejected a gold\\yellow ball of light from the rear of the plane and i drove off. i never had a memory of the plane going from one place to the next and somehow i must have lost time. i along with gary and three of my friends drove to the turner district in wyandotte county to the inland cold storge area(caves) next to the kansas(kaw)river. as i was driving and this had to be around 3am i looked over and saw a green paneled van and the driver was parked on the road looking toward my car as he was on side dirt or gravel road that was next to the river.i remember telling everyone in the car look at that nut as this man had on dark(black) glasses and had on black cap. as we drove past him a siren came in behind me and i stopped as it was the wyandotte county sherrif's department and they wanted to know why we were out there so late and i told one of the deputies as they checked our id that we were looking for ufo's and they told us to go home as neither deputy laughed at us or doubted our word. the next day i along with one of my friends went to gary's room and he never answered and we checked at the front desk and the clerk said he had not seen gary but would check his room as when he did gary was not in his room and whatever belongings he had were gone as we never seen gary again. a week later on saturday afternoon i was on the third floor ymca shower getting ready for my date and i remember like it happened today the outer door to the restroom opened and a young man in his teens or twenties at least six feet tall with flowing blond hair and wearing dark black glasses and some type of white clothes walked directly to the shower as by this time i went to the shower door as it had a small window as to look out and opened the door and this young man grabed my groin and yanked my penis and then turned around and left as i was stunned and shocked. i dried off and got dressed and went to the desk and ask the man at the desk if he saw anyone leave and he said no by then another man came down and said he had been taking a shower on the second floor shower and the same young man walked to the shower door opened it looked at him and left without touching him. i was dating ny future wife at the time and told her and her parents as we sort of brushed this off at the time as i never contacted the police as i was not hurt but only reported this as i said to the man at the desk who wrote an incident report.in 1968 i entered the united states army at fort leonard wood mo and during basic training i hurt my leg and went to the base hospital,and was exaimed as i hurt my femur bone during training and my leg was exrayed and on the exray it clearly showed a large object lodged on my femur bone as the doctors were not sure if it was a tumor or not and said they may need to operate as it was an unusual object.i was never operated on but have had exray's taken at different times over the years and most recent again at the va the last year as i seen that this object is still on the femur bone. i am now 61 and remember this like it was yesterday and off and on have attempted to contact mufon in kc and california and just recently in new york as i have made contact recently but have never told my story yet and i'm waiting to hear back as i need to know what happened that week and if i have an implant on my femur bone and and i along with gary and my friends taken aboard this ship and also if the young man who touched me was an alien and implanted me. i have tried piecing the puzzle together about this incident that occurred in 1967that was 40 years ago as i am now 61 but i remember this like it happened today every detail.i have more to add but will do so soon."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object
