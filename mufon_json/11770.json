I was a very hot sultry evening and I had not been drinking or taken any drugs. There appeared in the eastern sky 2 slow moving fireballs that processed slowly across the sky before being obscured by a building. They were completely silent and no one l else seemed to notice although the angle that I was sitting at meant that people were not naturally looking in that direction. the entire sighting lasted about a minute and I believe that they were at about 2 thousand feet. I am not interested in UFOs and can offer no obvious explanation. Both their path and speed were constant."],"Region":"Berlin","Country":"Germany"}
