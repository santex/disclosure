I called my husband and his friend out to the back yard to come see this. I noticed the object because how bright orange it was. I knew as soon as I seen it, it had to have been some type of UFO, because how low and fast it was moving. It was no way it had been a plane, as we see them fly over every night. The object did not dance, or disappear, but it just moving at a high speed in the same direction. I was actually very excited to see this object flying above us. I was just afraid of being abducted, as you never know. I lost site of the object was it was passing over near the trees. It only lasted about two minutes tops."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Latitude":"37.688889","Region":"Kansas","Longitude":"-97.336111","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.688889,+-97.336111(41436)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41436) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41436.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41436.html"],"Log Number":"US-08052012-0002","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"41436","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Wichita","There were no other sightings in Wichita on or around August 3rd 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","City":"Wichita","Summary":"Saw Basketball SIzed glowing Orange ball in the sky moving very fast.","Date of the Event":"08/03/2012 10:13 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
