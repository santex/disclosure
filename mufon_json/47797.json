I watched it wondering if it was a star, then it started to glow brighter, I took my cellphone out and tried to take a picture then it headed W-SW as if it was headed back into the stars. I then started to tap on my back door window trying to get my girlfriends attention to come up and witness this, but she didnt hear me hitting the glass, then the light deminished into nothing and disappeard as if it had headed deep into space (my assumption by its appearance of direction). I waited to see if I could see any faint movement in the sky of its light which I thought I had and it was gone. Thats it! I added a photo, the thing is towards the middle of the picture, you might have to look kinda hard, but I dont see any other stars in the pic, this was the brightest and was lucky to get this."],"trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There were no other sightings in Independence on or around June 1st 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Missouri","Log Number":"US-06022013-0003","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States"}
