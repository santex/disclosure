It was the first UFO I ever saw. I was coming home from Newport Beach at around 5:20 PM. As I was getting on the freeway that was the beginning of the freeway I was in a lot of traffic. All of a sudden to my right (south) I saw a large cigar shaped object approaching the freeway. It was completely covered with lava having no windows. It was about 60 feet long. It was about 50 feet high. It traveled across the freeway at about 3 mph. When it went behind some trees that were in a resavoir I sped up to see it more, but it was gone. As soon as I got home about 30 minutes later I put on my radio. The first station I put on said, \"UFO raid in Orange County.\" Then 12 people were interviewed who saw a disc shaped object at Huntington Beach (a neighboring beach from Newport Beach). The 12 people said they saw the object for about 7 minutes hovering then it disappeared at a high rate of speed."],"Case Number":"24624","Object Shape":"Cigar","City":"Newport Beach","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Newport Beach","There were no other sightings in Newport Beach on or around September 10th 1978"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.919777","Region":"California","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.62716,+-117.919777(24624)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24624) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24624.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24624.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Date Submitted":"07/18/2010 04:01 UTC","Summary":"A cigar shaped covered with lava crossed the freeway"}
