the intensity grew consistency dimmer in a very linear fashion. this is important to note because the light appeared to remain dim, but visible, as it proceeded away from my aircraft. this is not a typical trait of a forward facing landing light found on conventional aircraft. my onboard gps was programmed direct for kagc, my destination in pennsylvania. gps indicated my distance was 298 nautical miles from kagc. i later estimated my magnetic coarse would have been approximately 035 degrees. this indicates my aircraft location was in close proximity to morristown tennessee. without factoring for a wind correction angle, i can estimate the strange light i witnessed may have been located in close proximity to the harlan kentucky general area. the weather underground archives indicate the following conditions on that day at 8:20 pm, as recorded from the jonesville virginia weather reporting station. temperature 37.4 degrees f, due point 30.2 degrees f, humidity 75%, sea level pressure 30.21 in, visibility 10 miles, wind calm, no gusts, no precipitation, conditions partly cloudy. my conclusion: based on lack of data, all i can conclude at this time is that i witnessed the visible white light being emitted from a self-powered and intelligently controlled object or vehicle, as it performed maneuvers not typical to conventional aircraft."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Morristown","Date of the Event":"03/07/2011 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/04/2011 05:17 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"I witnessed the visible white light being emitted from a self-powered and intelligently controlled object or vehicle, as it performed maneuvers not typical to conventional aircraft.","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Tennessee","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.220131,+-83.287152(29396)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29396) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Morristown","There were no other sightings in Morristown on or around March 7th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-06042011-0020","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"29396","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-83.287152","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.220131"}
