I made up the times and dates but that doesn't matter. What I have seen can be seen on any clear night. I have a question. What are the objects that I see a night. They look like stars until you notice that they flash red, blue and green. I have looked at them with binoculars and the colors go around the outter edge of the craft rather like a lighthouse light. I have seen as many as eleven on one night. I have been told that these are UFOs. IF they are, why aren't they talked about on these UFO hunter TV shows? Thanks for any information you have time to send. Joyce Johnson"],"Date of the Event":"01/19/2008 09:24 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arizona"}
