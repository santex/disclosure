Also, about a year or so previous to that sighting I was driving north on US-1 at approximately the same time and also above me but about a degree west I saw a bright tiny light that went on and just as quickly it went off three times. It moved very quickly. I saw it first north, then almost above me and then behind me. It traveled so quickly that this event did not take more than a second. Both incidents traveled from north to south."],"Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3888.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3888.html"],"Object Shape":"Oval","Case Number":"3888","Longitude":"-80.141489","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-09232005-0009","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"12/19/2004 12:00 UTC","City":"Fort Lauderdale","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.126078,+-80.141489(3888)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3888) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/19/2004 12:00 UTC"}
