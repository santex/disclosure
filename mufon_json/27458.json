As i was heading to a Gym i saw something in the sky no other color than white moving fast. when i first noticed it was very fast not as fast as a comet. First i thought is was an air plane but when i realized even though i am a huge fan of StarWars The CloneWars it was nothing i ever saw. the object was only white and a fast moving object. At the time i was a little scared but later i thought it was nothing to worry about. As i saw the object moving ans moving it sudenly went away. Still A little creepy and i did not get any recording and or photo's because it was to small."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:16","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Everett","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27458.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27458.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Very Fast Moving Object With No Flashing lights.","Longitude":"-122.196249","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.984705,+-122.196249(27458)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27458) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/19/2011 06:05 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/19/2011 11:53 UTC","Latitude":"47.984705"}
