{"Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Small disc observed through (daylight) telescope, not a plane s-se.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI am an experienced astronomy hobbiest, using a telescope I observed an oval disc, looked metallic in color, definitely not a plane, or commercial airliner. Through telescope my wife and myself could make out an oval shape which changed colors, it was very small in the telescope, but had a definite oval shape, moved without sound. I thought it could have been a satellite, (but these are very hard to see in daylight hours) but the trajectory was not in a linear path, and using Starry Night Software it was confirmed that no satellites were scheduled for the time in question. Not sure what is was, and just wanted to get this reported in case others saw the same thing. While using the internet I noted a similar object was observed in Texas on June 17, 2010. This is the first time in 30 yrs I have ever seen anything that I couldn't immediately explain. Not as exciting as the Bollide I saw a few years ago, but this was definitely more strange."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ontario","Log Number":"CA-06202010-0013","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.857175,+-79.017083(23843)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23843) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/20/2010 02:13 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Ajax","There were no other sightings in Ajax on or around June 19th 2010"],"Case Number":"23843","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23843.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23843.html"],"City":"Ajax","Longitude":"-79.017083","Date of the Event":"06/19/2010 06:04 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.857175"}
