I noticed a circle of lights in the sky and when I looked at it, it immediately darted to the north. It was a circle of approximately 8 white lights. I am aware that the Days Inn of Conneaut had a search light in operation for a special event. I considered that the search light was what I saw, but I later felt it was not. Perhaps others saw the same."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-01292012-0014","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.422947,+-82.903583(35338)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35338) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"01/28/2012 10:20 UTC","Region":"Ohio"}
