{"Latitude":"42.360591","divs":["sighting detailsi leave for work at this time twice a week, and this is the first time i have ever noticed something like this in my life. i thought it could be spotlights or something, especially as there was a slight over cast and it rained later in the morning, but like i stated earlier i haven't seen any spotlights here before. i was really surprised as to what i was seeing and didn't get an exact number but the lights were not following a set pattern, and they were all whitish\\yellowish in color and circular and looked larger than spotlights, but not huge. there were about 7-9 i would say and it appeared as if they were circling around each other almost in a playful way two or three at a time grouped together. like i said, it could have been spotlights for search lights, but i've never noticed them before, and it's now 10pm the same day and there is nothing out and it's a clear sky. just wondering what i might have seen if you have any ideas?!"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"19929","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19929.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19929.html"],"Summary":"7-9 circular shapes moving around each other in early morning sky.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10132009-0011","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/13/2009 10:03 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/13/2009 03:15 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.360591,+-71.051913(19929)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19929) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","City":"Boston","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Boston","There were no other sightings in Boston on or around October 13th 2009"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-71.051913","Region":"Massachusetts"}
