As we were talking, I noticed this super bright white light traveling slowly through the sky from the Northwest. It was not a satellite as I have spent stargazing watching them for years. I thought I might be the landing light of a helicopter, but there was absolutely no noise to be heard. My neighbourhood was very quiet at the time. I told my buddy to look over my way. He lives about 20 km from me, and he could see it too. It was traveling along without a sound and not at a speed of a helicopter. It made an \"S\" motion at 1 point, then was moving over Szczecin towards my friends place in the SouthEast. It flickered a few times and then it was gone. There were a few clouds in the sky at the time. It's been a weird week for UFO events here. On a side note- I have also witnessed something very similar to this about 5 years ago in Langley B.C.
