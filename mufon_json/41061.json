{"divs":["sighting detailson 7\\21\\12 i was in my yard at about 11:30 pm walking my dog before i went to bed.i just happened to look up and noticed what a crystal clear night it was and how bright the stars were. i tried to find the big dipper when i noticed what i thought was a star only brighter than the others. i then thought it must be the north star. i observed this for about 20 seconds and this light suddenly got brighter and then seemed to ascend very quickly getting smaller but not diminishing in brightness. this lasted about for 5 seconds until i could no longer see it. i was confused as to what i saw and thought to wake my wife but it was already gone, i then thoght mybe it would come back so i returned the dog to the house and steped outside for awhile but saw nothing else."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.425159,+-73.267256(41061)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41061) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41061.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41061.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/21/2012 11:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Newtown","There were no other sightings in Newtown on or around July 21st 2012"],"Case Number":"41061","Latitude":"41.425159","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Newtown","Region":"Connecticut","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07222012-0024","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-73.267256","Summary":"Sighted the object between a group of stars then it acended quickly out of sight","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/22/2012 01:52 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
