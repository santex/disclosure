When the last two were directly overhead, they hovered. This was similar to watching a jellyfish in water. Within this brief span of time, the middle orb appeared to shift out of focus, almost like an object loses focus in a camera viewfinder. As this continued, it took on the shape of a transparent, orange octagon. Not long after they ascended one by one before disappearing. Cloud cover was zero. My father was witness to this. He had actually seen a similar display around March of 2013 in the same area. Upon seeing this event, he confirmed that the orbs were the same as he had witnessed. It should be noted that my father is a licensed pilot and an air traffic controller with 25 years of experience. He was at a loss for what he saw, ruling out flares, parachutes, helicopters, drones and toy rockets."],"Summary":"Three in formation.
