The brightness of the object made me notice it. I was coming home from dinner with my mom and dad. They live 3 miles away to the east. The light went perfectly straight and just dimmed. I went for binoculars and object was not in the area it should have been when I returned. Father saw the same object from his house and said it just dimmed. I called Cleveland and Columbus airports. They had no information on light. The object moved north to south and the sky was clear. The object was at about 30k' in the sky. Bright star with no running lights. No sound was audible. Girlfriend also witnessed. Another girl by dad also witnessed. Girl unknown. Not a satellite. Saw a satellite later.
