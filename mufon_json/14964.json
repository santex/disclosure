I noticed above me in the sky were 2 single engine airplanes. I started to watch them because they were flying pretty close to each other. AS they started to pass out of view, I noticed an object thousands of feet higher than the airplanes. It was completely motionless. I watched the object for 4-5 minutes. I have never seen a star during the day but I hear its possible sometimes. So I thought if it were a star then it would still be there if I looked away. I looked away for a second and then back again. The object was gone. I scanned the rest of the sky over and over, and couldnt see the object anywhere. It appeared to be just a circular white object. I couldnt see much more than that. It also appeared to by much higher than any airplane I've seen fly."],"Latitude":"33.668597","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"California","Longitude":"-117.993306","Case Number":"14964","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/17/2009 03:51 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14964.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14964.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Huntington Beach"}
