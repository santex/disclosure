While approaching a red light we notice the object in the sky, that was larger than a star. Seconds later, two bright flashes of light came out from both sides of the object. Then it took off forward and was gone in about 2 seconds. We both had the exact same reaction, asking each other, \"did you see that, oh my God did you see that?\" At first it was very exciting, it was unsettling until the next day. If I can be of any other assistance, please feel free to contact me. Thanks for listening."],"Date Submitted":"06/29/2010 11:23 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Object in sky resembling a reflector.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24026.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24026.html"],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Fleetwood","There were no other sightings in Fleetwood on or around June 24th 2010"],"Case Number":"24026","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle"}
