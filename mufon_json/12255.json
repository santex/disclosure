{"divs":["sighting detailsa friend and i seemed to have witnessed some unusual red lights in the sky above el cajon, ca around 8:35 p.m. on 8\\28\\08. my friend was in the jacuzzi and i was inside his house reading the sports section of the newspaper. he called my attention saying that he was seeing satellites in the sky. so i opened the door to the backyard and looked in up in the sky and immediately noticed two red lights that were blinking back and forth and seemed to be connected somehow as if they were on a straight line. i said immediately after seeing the lights, \"what the hell is that?\" it was obviously not a satellite or satellites. what struck me and my friend was the distance between the two lights. the lights were too far apart to be like lights on the wing of an aircraft. this was at my friends house, he lives under a flight path so we've seen many planes in the night's sky. this was no plane. these lights made no sound and moved at a smooth seemingly constant pace until they faded into the distance. i don't know what these lights were, but i feel that they were significantly strange. i've never seen anything like this before, so i felt i should share this experience. i don't expect any explanation or closure on this sighting; i just felt that i should share the information that i saw something strange in the sky."],"Summary":"Strange Red Lights","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08292008-0002","Latitude":"36.788221","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.788221,+-119.410652(12255)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12255) map </A>","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12255.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12255.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/28/2008 08:35 UTC","Longitude":"-119.410652","Case Number":"12255","Date of the Event":"08/28/2008 08:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
