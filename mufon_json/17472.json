but none of these questions seemed to have a rational answer as to what we'd witnessed on that night. the entire episode lasted approximately 30 seconds and although i had a digital camera with me, unfortunately i could not retrieve it and power it up quick enough to take pics of the event given how quickly it all happened."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06132009-0020","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17472.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17472.html"],"Object Features":"None, Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/10/2009 09:10 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Roswell","There were no other sightings in Roswell on or around June 10th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
