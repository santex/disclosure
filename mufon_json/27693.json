{"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Summary":"round, spherical,soft white in color","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsA friend and I were outside the front of my house talking when a round, soft white in brightness large sphere caught my peripheral vision. I voiced out what's that! My friend saw it also but he thought it was a balloon. We watched it as it traveled from the northwest to southwest horizons in about 5 seconds. It was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. No noise was heard. No blinking lights, just a pure soft white glow. It was at a high altitude because its glow diminished when it traveled behind thin high altitude clouds in the sky. I was amazed at how fast the object went from horizon to horizon. It traveled in an absolute straight line without deviation, no fluctuation whatsoever as the type that wind would cause. It was a windy evening in the S.F. Bay Area. We lost sight of it when it went below the southwest visible horizon(behind a house across the street)."],"City":"Fremont","Date of the Event":"02/05/2011 09:35 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"02/06/2011 02:01 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27693.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27693.html"],"Log Number":"US-02062011-0002","Region":"California","Latitude":"37.55337","Longitude":"-121.980682","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.55337,+-121.980682(27693)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27693) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"27693","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Fremont","There were no other sightings in Fremont on or around February 5th 2011"],"Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
