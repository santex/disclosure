Shortly after I got settled, a glowing white sphere suddenly switched on in the shallow valley below me and slowly meandered around the trees until I lost sight of it as it floated deeper into the woods and then over a pond. The sphere was about eight feet in diameter and hovered about five feet off the ground. When I reunited with my son, several hours later, he described the same object to me without me having said a word to him."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.059177,+-83.901106(7522)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7522) map </A>","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7522.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7522.html"],"Tags":"City","City":"Hillman","Longitude":"-83.901106","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
