It was so much larger and brighter than anything else in the sky that I noticed it as soon as I began viewing the night sky. I wondered if it was something projected from the ground, but it was much too high in the sky for that. Nor could it be a light projection from the earth to sky. It was located in the upper southwest quadrent. It remained stationary for over 15 minutes. I returned to the house, but came out an hour later. It was still there. This time I noticed an aircraft flying below it and could compare sizes somewhat. The triangular object was much larger, perhaps 50 times larger. I watached for another 15 minutes. The object remained stationary. An hour later I returned to look but it was gone. I hoped the triangular object was being viewed by the aircraft and that I might read about it in the newspaper, but it was not. I felt confounded by the object, trying to make sense of it, but could find no explanation for what it might be and concluded that it was a UFO."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.686103,+-116.771176(22870)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22870) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-116.771176","Date of the Event":"04/15/2010 08:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22870.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22870.html"],"City":"Coeur d'Alene","Summary":"Spotted large triangular object in sky.
