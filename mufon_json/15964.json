I'm beginning to feel crazy, after the jet and object sighting last night, I became extremely tired, had a minor headache and so I decided to take a nap. I had a dream. It was vivid and realistic. I can't remember all too well but I went onto the craft, it was bright. I spoke to them, all I remember is they were green and tall. I don't remember the conversation, or what else happened, only that we were traveling somewhere. When I went to bed it was 12am, and woke up at 2am to a loud noise, feeling a bit startled in a completely different spot and position on my bed. I felt as if I was being watched by something. At the time I wrote it off as just a dream, but I've had a raging sinus headache since and there are (deep and surface) cuts all over my body. Apparently, my boyfriend has had the same experience. I don't know what to make of it."],"Log Number":"US-03112009-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.191003,+-114.044496(15964)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15964) map </A>","Longitude":"-114.044496","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Kingman","Case Number":"15964","Tags":"City","Summary":"Abduction?
