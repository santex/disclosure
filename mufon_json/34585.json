We saw a couple meteors go by and we were about to go back in. As i was watching the sky i saw a triangular object come into view with five dim orange lights. I yelled for my husband to look and he looked up and saw it also. This craft made absolutely no sound. It was dead quiet outside and we heard nothing as this craft went by. We observed the craft for about 20 seconds as it traveled south east until it was out of site. Both of our reactions were we felt like it was not something of human origin. I was in almost total shock when we came back in the house, shocked that i saw something like this so close."],"Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34585.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34585.html"],"Log Number":"US-01042012-0006","Case Number":"34585","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Middle River","There were no other sightings in Middle River on or around January 4th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"01/04/2012 02:20 UTC","Latitude":"39.334274","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Middle River","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-76.439406"}
