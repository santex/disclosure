The one that concerns my husband and me is the sighting on January 8th, 2008 in Stephenville, Texas. Here's what happened. We were going down from Qu���bec towards Arizona to spend the winter in a campground resort. On January 8th, 2008, we stopped in a Walmart parking to spend the night with our fifthwheel in Hattiesburg City, Mississippi. Shortly after our arrival, we were outside looking around and we saw the sky which looked curious to us. I said to my husband: \"Take a picture of the sky. It looks very funny.\" So he did. Then, a few days after our arrival at our campround in Arizona, my husband was looking at the pictures we took coming down and when he saw that picture we wondered what is it that was showing in that picture. At that moment, I reminbered earing on the radio while we were on the road towards Arizona that there had been a sighting in Texas. We didn't go further with our concern at that moment. But last Sunday after seing that programm, we started wondering again. So we are sending you attached to this document the picture we took on January 8th, 2008 at 20:56:40. We took the picture with a Canon PowerShot A80 and we have the picture with the date and hour on it on a CD. We don't know if this is pertinent or of interest to you and your organization. Also it may be a climat situation that shows in the picture. But like we say in french: \"It cost nothing to know\". Thank you for reading us and have a nice day."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","Case Number":"46038","Summary":"See below please.","Log Number":"US-03052013-0005"}
