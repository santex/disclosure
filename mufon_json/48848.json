She asked me to meet her at a \"reserve\" kind of place, and I got there before she did. Honestly, I began talking to spirits(of which I do), and taking pictures. But, I had recalled someone saying, \"If you want to see a ufo, just point the cameras up\"..so, I did, and the very first thing I seen, was this dark sphere. I figured balloon, and thought, \"I'll go ahead and get it on video if I can...so I did. It's so far away, so I'm not sure what it is. Strange thing, and not sure if this COULD be connected; however, earlier I was doing EVP work @ a cemetery and received a \"Class A\" EVP(anyone can make out without enhancement); which is rare. Then, I was taking photos inside of a tomb, thru a small window...WITH NO FLASH...and got a VERY nice orb. Then, while waiting on Dani, I happened to catch this object in the sky. I reviewed it on my Window Movie Maker software to view it frame by frame; and got one shot that even shows a few different colors \"possibly\" I'm not trying to cry wolf here, just not sure WHAT EXACTLY it is."],"Summary":"sitting @ a park waiting on girlfriend. I had my camera and took some pics; then thougt I'd take shots of the sky randomly, and the VERY FIRST thing I saw, was this sphere that was dark in color, so I began to shoot video.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/09/2013 03:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"48848","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-86.006453","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.958643","Date Submitted":"07/10/2013 10:27 UTC","City":"Fishers"}
