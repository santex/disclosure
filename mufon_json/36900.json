I was selecting some tunes on my Ipod and when I looked back at the road I saw a light in the distance. I figured it was just a light as it looked to be at a regular height for a street light. It was far in the distance above a private airport which doesn't get any use after it gets dark. It was 11:45 P.M. The light then began to slowly raise up over the airport, the airport had no lights on. after about 10 minutes of it raising up I turned to make sure no cars were on the road behind me, when I turned back it was completely gone. 2 Mins. later 3 helicopters flew by the area where the object was. They were fairly high up. After these 3 choppers I saw no more aircrafts in the sky for half an hour."],"Date of the Event":"03/26/2012 11:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","Region":"Ontario","Case Number":"36900","Object Flight Path":"Other","Longitude":"-78.403786"}
