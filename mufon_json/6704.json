which was startling (more on that in a minute) to me. it traveled in a straight line in a north\\northeasterly direction and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. i would estimate from the time she said she saw a balloon until the time it was gone was probably 30 - 35 seconds maximum. i watched it myself for maybe 20 seconds at the most. serena also saw it. i can't say how high because i just suck at judging vertical distances and would not even hazard a guess. it was at an altitude where no wings were visible but you could clearly see that something was moving through the sky even though it was pretty high up. it happened between 5:15pm and 5:20pm. i know because i noted the time on the clock when we went inside as soon as it was out of sight. my nieces were jumping all over telling my mother and my sister how we saw a ufo. naturally, they looked at me and were ready to say \"yeah sure\" when i told them that whatever it was we saw it sure wasn't a plane, helicopter, blimp or balloon. once i thought about it the video footage that is always shown of silver orbs over mexico city was what immediately came to mind. here is some more info on me and the location: i have been a professional photographer and videographer for 19 years. i am trained to notice things and remember. my sister wanted to know why i didn't take out my cellphone and take a photo or video of it. i know damn well that a 1.3 megapixel cellphone camera won't do a thing at the distance i was dealing with. i would have needed to have a high end camera with a good optical zoom (not a digital zoom) to get anything worthwhile. i had one in the car but by the time i would have gotten it out the moment would have passed so i was counting on myself to remember details as much as possible. i have also been in a number of planes and helicopters for aerial photos in the past. it was not any type of helicopter. it was dead silent and too fast. it didn't do any kind of amazing acrobatics as people often report. it just traveled in a straight line. where i live in chicopee ma i am in proximity to 4 airports so i see planes all the time. i am 10 minutes from westover air reserve base in chicopee so i see c5 transports and other miltary aircraft all the time (not to mention the airshows they have every year). i am 20 minutes from barnes municipal airport in westfield. i often see warthogs flying manuevers. i am 20 minutes from northampton airport (a small private airport) so i see light aircraft like cessnas. i am 40 minutes from bradley international airport in ct. so i see commercial flights all the time as well. also, every plane i see these days has contrails of some sort. within 90 minutes of the sighting i counted 6 other aircraft flying overhead. i could see the wings on each one as well as contrails from each one. i did see one plane that was in a steep climb to go way up and couldn't hardly see it at all....but i saw the contrail. whatever we saw had no contrail which was a fact that i really picked up on. i know that whatever we saw was not a commercial airliner, military transport, helicopter, blimp, weather balloon, cessna or ultralight. it was round, fast and quiet. if i hadn't seen it myself i would have dismissed the observations of two preteen girls easily. at the risk of embarrassment i am filing this report because i know what i saw. i have tried to dismiss the sighting but cannot think of what it could have been. as much as i do personally believe in ufos i also take every single report i read with a healthy dose of skepticism without hard evidence to back up the claim. i also now understand why so many people don't have photo or video footage when they see things. i was so totally mesmerized and trying to take in what it was that i was seeing that getting proof was the last thing on my mind. i was more concerned with details so i could report with some semblance of credibility. i would be happy to follow up the report with a phone conversation if necessary but don't know what else i can add aside from the fact that i am not crazy. i realize that an 8 y.o. and a 4 y.o. aren't exactly credible corraborating witnesses but that's all i can tell you."],"Case Number":"6704","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"42.152634","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.152634,+-72.602917(6704)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6704) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Region":"Massachusetts"}
