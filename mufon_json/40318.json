{"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting Details��� I had watched the evening flight of bats, observing their aerial acrobatics as they feed on mosquitos, gnats, etc. Nightfall came, but the unseasonably cool breeze was so pleasant, I continued to site in my backyard, relaxing. At 8:40 p.m. I witnessed the first of a series of 14 luminous objects. Each was glowing yellow with a bright red field which was fan-like above it and diminished as the object moved away from me, going northward. There were several hundred yards between each with some variation. The linear flight pattern of all 14 objects required less than 3 minutes to move across and disappear in the northern sky. As each approached, it had the appearance of a large candle flame in the blackness of night.��� ��� Sworn Statement: I am not a UFO buff. My interest in the subject is no more than casual. I am an avid camper and hiker. In the hundreds of times I���ve camped under the starts, I have never seen anything in the night sky that I could not identify. I have no explaination for the luminous objects I witnessed on 4 June, 2012. All of the statements and descriptions I have made regarding these luminous objects are true to the best of my ability.\""],"City":"Bay St Louis","Date Submitted":"07/06/2012 01:12 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.320968,+-89.343009(40318)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40318) map </A>","Longitude":"-89.343009","Latitude":"30.320968","Case Number":"40318","Log Number":"US-07062012-0032","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/04/2012 08:40 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Bay St Louis","There were no other sightings in Bay St Louis on or around June 4th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Mississippi","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40318.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/40318_submitter_file1__OriginalDrawing.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40318.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Fourteen yellow objects with red aura observed for 2 to 3 minutes"}
