I was sitting on the front porch looking out over the trees to the West toward Brady Lake. Suddenly there was a red vertical strobe that extended several hundred feet in the air. I thought \"I didn't know there was a tower over there.\" I'm a pilot and know where these are. I looked again. There isn't one. I had a sense of being watched and there was a loud buzzing in my head."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.135168,+-99.335055(7956)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7956) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"Red strobe like a radio tower where none exists","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Brady","There were no other sightings in Brady on or around September 19th 2007"],"City":"Brady","Longitude":"-99.335055","Case Number":"7956"}
