What looked to be a huge rod going straight up into the sky. After further observation it was clear that this was a trail of some kind. The strange part about it was that it did a countrclockwise full turn around, changing in width, color, and direction. In my heart and mind all I could think about was that this was not a natural cloud formation. What is was will always be beyond me. The anomaly was unvisible when night set in. I will be keeping my eyes more open to the skies of the Carolinas from now on."],"Latitude":"35.228227"}
