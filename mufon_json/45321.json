I at first thought it was a bird but it was too metallic to be a bird and it was moving like a plane. It was moving laterally and seemed to be swaying to when it eventually just dropped out of the sky and disappeared. It honestly just did a turn about in the sky and vanished. I was just confused more than anything and was watching it the entire time as I was the passenger but no one else seen it but me."],"City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/19/2013 04:37 UTC","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"45321","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Wings","Longitude":"-89.395708","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/19/2013 08:44 UTC","Latitude":"40.639125","Log Number":"US-01192013-0015","Region":"Illinois","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
