{"Region":"Florida","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe witness was walking on the beach at Cherie Down Park, near Coco Beach FL. As he looked out over the ocean he saw a navy sub going out and over Cape Canaveral he saw an object like an inverted pie pan, metallic in appearance.There was an extension on top which he described as a plastic cake cover. The object had a horizontal line around the center. The object had no wings or propellors and there was no smoke coming from it. It was over the restricted air space at Cape Canaveral. He viewed it for about a minute, then when he looked away at the submarine, the object had simply disappeared. A woman was with the witness, but since she is blind, he did not mention the unidentified object to her."],"Longitude":"-80.566391","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8630.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8630.html"],"Latitude":"28.467501","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12172007-0008","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Cocoa Beach","There were no other sightings in Cocoa Beach on or around December 16th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/16/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","City":"Cocoa Beach","Case Number":"8630","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.467501,+-80.566391(8630)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8630) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"UFO over Cape Canaveral","Date of the Event":"12/16/2007 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:01:10","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
