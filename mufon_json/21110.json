I had my camcorder nearby and decided to film them. After reviewing the footage I noticed a small object briefly move through the left side of the screen. My camcorder was at maximum zoom at the time, so this object was at the same altitude or higher than the aircraft formation. The attached video shows the aircraft contrails and the small flying object. I have reviewed this footage several times and you can see that the object clearly makes a turn to the left. It also appears to pulsate."],"Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-81.029154","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/24/2009 07:23 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/15/2009 01:35 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
