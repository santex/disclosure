{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe (My relatives and me) were at Lake Macanahay looking at the sky. We were going camping on the lake side, and were looking at the sky. We looked west and noticed some lights in the sky moving over a bridge. We first thought that they weren't anything special. A plane group formation probably. I just stared at them anyways. I noticed that there were four or five of them. They flew in a perfect circle, and were green and red. We then thought they were UFOs. They flew in a circle, and then flew east. They flew into a group of stars and vanished. The group of stars was the Milky Way, well the part you see that got it the name."],"Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8176.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8176.html"],"Latitude":"41.132759","Case Number":"8176","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Ogallala","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Ogallala","There were no other sightings in Ogallala on or around August 6th 2005"],"Log Number":"US-10202007-0004","Region":"Nebraska","Object Flight Path":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.132759,+-101.715444(8176)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8176) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"00:01:12","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-101.715444","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/06/2005 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/06/2005 10:00 UTC","Summary":"Five or six spheres.
