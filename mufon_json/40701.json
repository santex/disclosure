The first thing I thought was- is that a slice of the moon covered partially by clouds? But it was gone as quick as it appeared and left behind at least two small blinking lights which slowly moved east which would ultimately lead to the Little Traverse Bay of lake Michigan."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Petoskey","There were 2 other sightings in Petoskey on or around July 10th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
