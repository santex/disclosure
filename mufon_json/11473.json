However, while doing some work on the GPS trails for fishing I got another shock. I had found a way to put the trails on my map program. The map of upper Carlyle Lake had an odd pattern on it, a rapidly moving curve that takes me over the railroad track and back! As I looked at it, I remembered that when I had gone under the bridge I had stopped and opened a map. What I had seen was that there were many stumps sticking out of the water and I needed to find the main channel and as much as possible follow it. Suddenly, without any memory of getting there, I found myself well into the lake section going in the wrong direction. I was quite confused. I remember waving my hands up and down. Because I was unsure, as to what side of the bridge I was on. I got the map out again and a compass straightened myself out and inexplicably proceeded to suppress the seemingly sudden position change. I then got back to exploring and fishing the area. The date was October 28, 1999. This date came from my fishing log. This is the only time I fished in this area of Carlyle Lake in a boat. I do not remember anything about the trip over the tracks, which requires the boat to be airborne! When I looked at the trail on the map the memory of the position change came back as if unlocking a safe and seeing a long forgotten item. As time went by, I remembered more details of the position change. The degree on confusion and disorientation is reflected in what I did. A compass is not needed on the north side of Carlyle���s railroad bridge. All one has to do is to line the map up with the bridge. I should have known what side of the bridge I was on by the many stumps sticking above the water. How someone can suppress an event of this magnitude I do not know but in several of the cases I have read about this is exactly what happens. As in these incidents, it took many months or over a year before something jarred my memory."],"Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/28/1999 02:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/28/1999 02:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.618939,+-89.352856(11473)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11473) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-89.352856","Region":"Illinois","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11473.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11473.html"],"Case Number":"11473"}
