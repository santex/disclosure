Off to the south west we saw an orange light in the sky that appeared and faded. A few moments later it appeared again along with two others they all became bright orange and the faded. This happened about three or four times. The last time that we saw the anomaly the orange light to the left of the other two shot out about four more orange lights then they all faded away. I have traveled this same highway many times over the years and I have seen orange lights in the sky a few times in the past year and this was the most interesting observation yet."],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Nevada","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-02242011-0001","Case Number":"27967","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Sphere, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Summary":"orange lights in the sky","City":"Wells","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.111589,+-114.96449(27967)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27967) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27967.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27967.html"],"Latitude":"41.111589","Object Features":"Unknown"}
