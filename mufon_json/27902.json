I was watching the flight paths of the planes coming to and from the airport when i noticed a faint moving light directly overhead. First I thought it was a satellite, but it was moving too fast. I then figured it was a plane at a high altitude, however as soon as i thought that i noticed another one. They seemed to be cigar shaped with a slight orange glow. At this point they started weaving in and out, stopping and abruptly changing direction. They then quickly moved off to the east and disappeared over new jersey. The whole thing lasted about a minute or less. I was very excited when it was over. I've been temporarily fooled by seagulls reflecting the city lights and chinese lanterns on new years eve, but I really can't explain the objects I saw last night. No photos or video, unfortunately."],"Latitude":"39.958045","City":"Philadelphia","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around February 18th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
