We saw a pale pink pulsating light that appeared in front of my truck and illuminated everything including the ground. The light seemed to lasted like 2 seconds then everything went dark again. About 5 seconds later the same light came again and lasted another 2 seconds. Then for the third time after 5 seconds it happened again. We didnt stop the truck but it was very weird what we experienced. I take that road many times during night time and never seen anything like this before. The light illuminated everything from trees, road, houses, etc. and I was doing 35 mile per hour.
