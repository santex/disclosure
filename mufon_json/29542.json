It's behavioral pattern didn't appear random, as it did seem to be following a very linear path as if it were under intelligent control. Strangely enough, i recalled seeing two jets flying in very close proximity to each other on the EXACT same path earlier in that afternoon which i managed to snap a picture of on my iPhone (which i will attach) The pic is a little blurry, but you can make out the 2 jets if you just look closely. I apologize for that, but it's the best i could get. These two events could be completely unrelated although it did strike me as an odd coincidence."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 50 other sightings in Knoxville","There were no other sightings in Knoxville on or around June 13th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.969698,+-83.911679(29542)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29542) map </A>","Latitude":"35.969698","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29542.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29542_submitter_file1__2jets001.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29542.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Star-like bright blue orb lazily drifting downward & to the north-east","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/14/2011 02:48 UTC","Log Number":"US-06142011-0002","Longitude":"-83.911679"}
