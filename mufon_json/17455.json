I noticed an object that was not there a few minutes before. At first it looked like a box kite.Then it changed shape & looked like a regular triangle kite. Then it changed shape again .This time it appeared like a metal framed box with a small cylinder type top.By this time I was getting pretty scared. I rubbed my eyes & it was gone that quick& made no sound at all.I had just taking a picture with my cell phone when I noticed it.But it was noticable in photo. Myt first thought was a kid had got a kite caught on a power line. But I soon realized that was not what I was seeing.But by its actions it was not a kite at all. I can't explain it."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17455.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17455.html"],"Longitude":"-97.341392","Object Features":"Other","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Temple","There were no other sightings in Temple on or around June 12th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.105884,+-97.341392(17455)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17455) map </A>","City":"Temple"}
