It was very shiny and metallic looking. It wasn't a plane or helicopter because it would change colors and it was as if it was following me. As i was driving i kept staring at it and almost made me have an accident by running off the road. I then decided to park my vehicle on the side of the road to get a better look. It then disappeared out of sight. The shape of the object was like that if a star and would not move anywhere just float in the air. It kind of scared me but I was really curious about it thats why I stopped to get a better look. And also it was very close to land when I saw it."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"28296","Longitude":"-85.30615","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Tennessee","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Star-like","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03192011-0010"}
