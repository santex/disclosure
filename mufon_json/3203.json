I heard acrackling sound, which caused me to open my eyes. I immediately saw what Iperceived as a meteor, that traced a path from near zenith until it went behindthe trees in a north-northeasterly direction. The color was orange-red, and itleft a glowing trace. I sure looked like a meteor to me, but the cracklingsound, almost like embers in a fire popping, was highly unusual and caused me tocall 911 to see where I should call to report this sighting. I was directed tocall the UFO hotline, where I was encouraged to report my sighting here."]}
