{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting details i took these fotos just south of denver colorado the night before last. 2\\27\\10. we got home around 10pm, and i looked up at the moon. the sky was rather overcast and there was a really cool ring around the moon, so i took a few pictures with my wife's new nikon camera. she says its 12 megapixels. when she showed me the fotos later there was this blue orb in the picture that i could not see at all when i was looking at the moon. not at all. it appears to be in front of the moon in the foto, but it doesn't seem to be one of those lens flares or something on the lens because it is out of focus in the second shot as much as the moon is out of focus. it seems to move up to the right in the last foto too. by definition this is a ufo to me, only because i just don't know what it is. it seems to have a shadow ring around it too and it looks like it is semi solid but definitely 3-d not just a flat image."],"Date Submitted":"03/01/2010 12:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"22068","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around February 27th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"39.743554","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03012010-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.743554,+-104.977333(22068)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22068) map </A>","Region":"Colorado","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Denver","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/27/2010 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Blue orb in fotos that wasn't seen while taking pictures of ring around moon","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-104.977333","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22068.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22068_submitter_file1__DSC_0570.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22068_submitter_file2__DSC_0571.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22068_submitter_file3__DSC_0572.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22068.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle"}
