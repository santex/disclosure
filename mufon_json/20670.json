I don't have the number of the file I was given. But here is the magnified version. This is the best I could do with the photo enhancement program I have. If you still have the origional, maybe you can do better. I used the telephoto feature. It was a long distance away. It also was cloaked by a cloud. I used the contrast to show the shape of the object. Now that I know how bright these suckers are, I can spot them. They move pretty fast. I'm lucky to get a snapshot. Everyone I showed the photo to, just couldn't see what I saw, so I cropped it down."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Tennessee","trends":["There have been 50 other sightings in Knoxville","There were no other sightings in Knoxville on or around October 15th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Picture taken from the truck at 60 mph.","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.962898","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20670.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20670_submitter_file1__ufo1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20670_submitter_file2__ufocrop.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20670_submitter_file3__ufocrop2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20670.html"],"City":"Knoxville","Date of the Event":"10/15/2008 12:00 UTC"}
