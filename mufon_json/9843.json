The sky was clear. I saw a dot of light directly overhead moving from west to east and thought it was a satellite. I looked away and realized that I could not see it with my unaided eyes. I did not move from my position. I looked again and the same dot of light was moving to starboard at 90 degrees to the original path. It had gone from an eastward path to a southward path in the time it took me to put down my binoculars and look through them again. I doubled checked with my naked eyes to make sure that I was looking at the same grouping of stars and used my binoculars again. It was still going south. It eventually dropped below the tree line. My feeling was one of amazement. No satellite makes right turns. No high flying jet does that either without traversing an arced path which I would have noticed. I realized that I had seen my first UFO. It was a humbling experience."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Date of the Event":"07/29/1977 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/29/1977 10:00 UTC","Longitude":"-75.370458","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03052008-0012","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.625932","City":"Bethlehem"}
