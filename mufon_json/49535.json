{"Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking pictures out side for a math project when I looked up and saw something strange in the sky. I took a picture of it and continued to watch it as it moved slowly in a diagonal line to the right and slightly up. The object seemed to be high up and far away. After watching it for a few seconds a tree obstructed my view of the object and I went inside to look at the picture. The object was flat and appeared to have lights on the bottom. I was surprised at what I had captured and was very curious to know what it was."],"Date of the Event":"10/26/2012 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.361017","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.894286,+-95.361017(49535)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49535) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Trinity","There were no other sightings in Trinity on or around October 26th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49535.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49535.html"],"Case Number":"49535","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"30.894286","Date Submitted":"08/06/2013 12:33 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Trinity","Summary":"flatlike shape with no sounds moving slow towards southeast","Log Number":"US-08062013-0018","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
