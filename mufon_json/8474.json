The movement was extremely slow. We were in a busy Wal-Mart parking lot and stopped to watch. To the right of the object four more small objects with long trailing fire tails appeared heading toward the one that was falling. I called my daughter- in- law to find out if anything was going on in the world that I had not heard about as we had been shopping about an hour west of our home in Georgia. Her answer was no. The first object continued to fall and the others continued toward it. In the blink of an eye the object just disappeared and one or two of the others did. We watched the remaining two or three for a minute or so and they blinked out also. My granddaughter is a very smart 8 year old and I am in my 50���s. I thought it was a comet, meteor or the space station falling out of the sky it was so slow and bright. I have checked the newspapers on-line and found nothing."],"Summary":"We saw a fireball with four small objects trailing toward it over Anderson SC on November 20.2007 at approx 5:30 P.M.","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"8474","Country":"United States","Region":"South Carolina","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Other","Weather Factors":"None"}
