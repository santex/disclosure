We looked up and saw a cigar shaped object just barely clearing the top of the buildings. The object was about 100 feet in length and had steady red lights on the bottom of it. The lights were rectangular in shape, and there were four along the bottom length of the object. It moved rather slowly across the sky from East to West, it seems to take a long time for it to fly past us. It is very rare when a plane flies over our 15 story apartment building, and then it's typically only a small plane or helicopter. We can see to the West of us aircraft approaching the Sacramento airport, however, they typically are traveling north. The object that we saw would have flown right into the flight pattern of approaching planes at the airport. After the object got a couple of miles past us, we could no longer see it, as the buildings and trees blocked our sight."],"Country":"United States","City":"Sacramento","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.584222,+-121.49007(22688)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22688) map </A>","Summary":"Cigar Shape object with red lights along the bottom","Latitude":"38.584222","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
