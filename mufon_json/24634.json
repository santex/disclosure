military planes? had the lights been white\\yellow, i would have thought so. i did ask my brother-in-law, who was a cargo pilot in the airforce during the vietnam era, and who still is a private pilot, and he stated that planes would only have white\\yellow lights, plus the blinking red and green wing lights on larger planes, but i suppose even he could be wrong. satelites? any that i've seen reflecting the sunlight were a more white\\yellow light as well. so, what they were, i truly don't know. i just know i haven't seen anything that color before moving like a plane moves, and definitely not in pairs and groups. i carefully watched the local news that night and for the next few days, checked the local papers, and looked online, because i thought this might be a newsworthy event, or at least someone might offer an explanation of these lights. since then, i've done a lot of searching online, and i haven't found any references to this event. it still baffles me because the lights were just such an odd color of orange, so unlike any aircraft i've seen."],"Region":"Michigan"}
