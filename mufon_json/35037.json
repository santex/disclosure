This was the only time anything was captured on camera other than wildlife. It was in the Paulding Forest Game preserve. There are no houses or people near where the camera was located and you can see from day time photos there is a pretty good tree canopy that blocks the sky. We have a series of 13 images one of which is a daytime shot to show the tree cover. I would like to submit them all for you to take a look at the sequence & movement of the object.Please contact me so that I may know how to send all the digital files.
