A few years while watching the local 6 o'clock evening news, a live report came in about an object that fell from the sky and crashed through the ice of a local pond. The reporter that was on the scene said the military arrived and sent in divers. The divers came up with an object that they immediatly threw a cover over. The reporter said he got a glimse of the object and it was a black box about the size of a basketball. After that, they cut back to the newsroom. The news anchor said they would have a follow up story on the 11 o'clock news. Well... there was no follow up on the story or anything in the local paper. Not a word about what happened at all. It makes you wonder what the goverment is up to."],"Date Submitted":"04/04/2006 05:58 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4641.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4641.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"4641","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"Unknown"}
