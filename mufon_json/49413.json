I looked up in the sky and seen like a blurry white orb hovering around, I watched it for about 2 minutes and it disappeared. A few minutes later I looked up again and there it was closer to be and looked like a floating star hovering around. I got my camera immediately and snapped a photo. Then it suddenly changed its path and made a sharp turn north. I live a few blocks south of the lake so im sure it headed over the lake. It disappeared from that point."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-80.082969","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/03/2013 09:30 UTC","City":"Erie","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.131134","Date Submitted":"08/03/2013 10:32 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49413.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/49413_submitter_file1__1002838.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49413.html"],"Log Number":"US-08032013-0010","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"flying star like object","Case Number":"49413","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Erie","There were no other sightings in Erie on or around August 3rd 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
