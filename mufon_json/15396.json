My partner exclaimed that the moon appeared cracked. The full moon was about 30 degrees above the horizon in the Eastern sky. It was daylight and the sky was clear. The object completely bisected the moon horizontally at midpoint making the moon appear split. The object appeared in the vicinity of the moon and would have to have been about 3500 kilometers long by 100 kilometers high. The object remained in the same trajectory as it appeared to move downward against our view of the moon and parallel to it. As it moved down from the face of the moon, the object was no longer visible. It appeared as a line completely bisecting the moon from mid-point moving to the bottom of the moon's face in about 6 seconds time or appearing to move over 200 km per second."],"Summary":"Saw a black object bisect the full moon and move downward in 6 seconds.","Log Number":"US-02082009-0015","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Michigan","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in West Branch","There were no other sightings in West Branch on or around February 8th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"02/08/2009 05:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.276408,+-84.238613(15396)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15396) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"West Branch","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/08/2009 05:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown"}
