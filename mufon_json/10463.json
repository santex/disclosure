I first thought it was an airplane but after a few seconds of observing the object, it suddenly stopped in midair. It did not move for around 3 mins. Suddenly it made a very steep u turn heading back towards where it came from however it seems to be going higher. Suddenly the object moved towards west at a very high speed, I I dont know how to calculate speeds however I am sure that no airplane can move that fast. it disappeared from my site in less than 30 seconds. My girlfriend also saw the event. I know this is not much, but I am participating in the hope that you get information on ufo activities outside the US as well."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"Philippines","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/21/2008 03:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Cebu City","There were no other sightings in Cebu City on or around March 21st 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:30","City":"Cebu City","Case Number":"10463","Latitude":"10.315699","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/21/2008 03:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Central Visayas","Log Number":"PH-04222008-0009","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
