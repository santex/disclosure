All 6 - 7 of the glowing orange \"objects\" seemed to be flying somewhat low. They formed the what looked exactly like the Big Dipper. That is what caught our eyes. I got some footage of the event, although it is not very good. The best footage only lasts about 20 seconds. I did a couple of not so great photos. Each UFO hovered and smoothly went across the sky. At some pre-determined point, (so it seemed), each one went up to the sky and vanished. It was like a fade-to-sky acension."],"Longitude":"-90.695758","Object Features":"Dome","Case Number":"50198","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50198.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50198.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.812208,+-90.695758(50198)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50198) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Disc","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"O'Fallon","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
