{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsthe witness phoned me on 6\\13\\2013 and left a message. i returned the call, and the witness recounted the following, as reconstructed from my sketchy notes: ���i was driving north in hinckley at about 11:00 pm last saturday [june 8, 2013] with my son (10) and daughter (8) in the car also, when i saw a bright light like a star to the north. it got brighter and dimmer and i could see the colors blue and red. i drove closer to it, then i handed my phone, which has a camcorder, to my son and turned the car left so my kids could see it. at that point i lost sight of it, but it must have approached the car very quickly, because my kids said it was over the car. they were frightened. [at this point] we were by the park in hinckley. there���s also an elementary school park; it was not that park. [i stopped the car] and looked up and it was overhead very close. it was v-shaped and had an orange-red color like a fluorescent light in the corner. it would have taken a 65��� tv screen at arm���s length to blot it out. [the object then moved off and i followed it for four blocks before it was out of sight.] i later told my mom [and sisters]; they laughed at me; i���m often looking at the sky. i saw three more of the same thing last night [june 12], with blue and red on top. i don���t have a computer or internet access. i asked a friend where i should report this and [s\\he] got your name from mufon. i have a question: do satellites have colored lights that they can dim and brighten? ��� later in trying to pin down the time more accurately, the witness said the time of the june 13th sighting was between 11:00 and 12:00 midnight. ��� w.i.m. chief investigator"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"48126","Summary":"V-shaped object with blue, red and orange-red lights approached, hovered over car.","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/08/2013 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.012245,+-92.838053(48126)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48126) map </A>","Region":"Minnesota","Log Number":"US-06142013-0011","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-92.838053","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Hinckley","There were no other sightings in Hinckley on or around June 8th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48126.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48126.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"06/14/2013 03:29 UTC","City":"Hinckley","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"46.012245"}
