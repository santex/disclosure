{"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is further to my previous report. I wanted to add that the first object seen was about magnitude 0 or brighter. Through 15x70 binoculars only the bright orange light could be seen. It did not change in brightness like a light which is aimed might be expected to do. It moved slowly, like a satellite. The second object, trailing the station, was not observed with aid. Possibly, it was not related to the first object, but it was quite a coincidence."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-80.250648","Log Number":"US-07242009-0018","Region":"West Virginia","Date of the Event":"07/24/2009 10:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/24/2009 10:15 UTC","Summary":"Object following space station - more information.","City":"Bridgeport","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.292059,+-80.250648(18284)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18284) map </A>","Case Number":"18284","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18284.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18284.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.292059","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Bridgeport","There was one other sighting in Bridgeport on or around July 24th 2009"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO"}
