{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas outside talking with my 17 year old son. Saw light in the sky that looked like a man-made satelight. Type that can be seen after sunset. It was moving in a straight line. Object then changed direction several times. Its speed stayed consent. No light sources could be seen on the object. But it was reflective. Object changed directions several times and would stop and hover. Object seemed to be very high up. Also seemed to change altitude. At one point we could make out the triangle shape of object. always seem to move with the \"front\" point going first. Only seemed to move sideways once. Movement did not mimic a aircraft. There was no sound from object. The event last over an hour. it would move all over the sky. Like it was surveying the Town and surounding area. We watched the object for just under an hour. At the end of sighting It simply returned to a straight flight path and went out of sight to the north."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/22/2012 01:04 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Object that looked like manmade satelight started changing direction and flight path.","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","City":"Temple","Latitude":"31.081038","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Temple","There were no other sightings in Temple on or around April 21st 2012"],"Longitude":"-97.351982","Case Number":"37654","Date of the Event":"04/21/2012 09:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-04222012-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37654.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37654.html"],"Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.081038,+-97.351982(37654)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37654) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
