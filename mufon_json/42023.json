{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThese craft show up nightly at approx 10:30pm and last til I retire about 3:00am - 3:30am. Have not been able to locate if they are there during daylight hours. No movement to very, very slow movement to the southwest. Locations of the smaller craft (red and green lights) have change over the course of 5 nights now. The main large white object is in the same spot but moves ever so slowly towards the southwest. Each night, there is a smaller red green light craft very close to the large white object. Others are spread out over miles, but plainly visible and flashing their red and green lights."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"41.320184","Log Number":"US-08262012-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42023.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42023.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"42023","Region":"Ohio","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.320184,+-81.720674(42023)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42023) map </A>","Longitude":"-81.720674","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"03:00:00","Date Submitted":"08/26/2012 01:07 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in North Royalton","There were 2 other sightings in North Royalton on or around August 25th 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/25/2012 10:30 UTC","Summary":"Same craft as the previous 4 nights","City":"North Royalton"}
