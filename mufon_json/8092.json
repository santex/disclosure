After a short stay, I left Sunday morning early on I-10 west. While joining I-25 North near Canutillo, Texas I noticed a white rectangular sharp edged craft on the driver's side of my truck(northwest). I did not see a tether or any kind of an attachment.It was approximately less than a mile up in elevation. It was completely stationary as if it was hovering. I watched it as I was driving to Las Cruces to pick up I-10 west again. When I looked back after joining I-10 it was gone. I didn't think much about it since Ft.Bliss and White Sands Missle Range are always experimenting with drones and missles. Seeing the craft was quite easy, the early morning sun reflected brilliant white on such a clear day."],"Latitude":"31.76027","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in El Paso","There were no other sightings in El Paso on or around June 10th 2007"],"Date of the Event":"06/10/2007 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"8092","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.76027,+-106.483461(8092)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8092) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"06/10/2007 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-106.483461","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8092.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8092.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Other"}
