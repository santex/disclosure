{"City":"Aztec","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside in the backyard grilling steaks when I looked up to the eastern sky and saw this very bright small cylinder shaped object moving from North to South. When first noticed, the object was at an azumith of about 75 degrees and an altitude of about 45 degrees. It faded a little as it moved south and was last seen about a minute later at an azumith of 135 degrees, altitude of 35-40 degrees. There was no sound, no exhaust or contrails visible, and I did not notice any wings or attached lights. The Sun was still about 10-15 degrees above the western horizon and the skies were only 10% cloud cover. Temperature at my location about 60 with only light winds. Because of the objects small size, I had the impression that it was at a very high altitude and therfore moving quite fast. No other objects were seen in the sky at this time. I have been an amateur astronomer for nearly 50 years, have a B.A. degree in Astronomy, but have never seen an object like this before."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New Mexico","Case Number":"29234","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.827726,+-107.989846(29234)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29234) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29234.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29234.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/24/2011 06:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/24/2011 10:37 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Aztec","There were no other sightings in Aztec on or around May 24th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-05242011-0007","Latitude":"36.827726","Summary":"Bright small cylinder","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-107.989846","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Source":"MUFON"}
