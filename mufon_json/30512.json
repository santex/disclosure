Tonite around 11 pm July 31st, I was making a sandwich and went outside to cut some chives for the sandwich, walked out onto my side porch and around to the nearby garden bed on side of house. Halfway there, I looked suddenly up at the sky and there was an aspirin sized object moving quickly in a straight path. Not fast, but quickly. It was yellow in color, slightly orangish. It was too low to be a star. I turned my head towards the window and called my boyfriend to come and see, and turned back to look at it and there was no sign of it whatsoever. At the speed it was moving, and in the split second I turned my head away and then back, it did not have time to leave the large patch of sky that was visible. It was in the same patch of sky where I saw the last one, and moving in the same direction."],"Weather Factors":"None, Unknown","City":"Croswell","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30512.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30512.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/31/2011 12:00 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-82.616412","Date Submitted":"08/06/2011 12:33 UTC","Latitude":"43.282696","Source":"MUFON"}
