(note: telescope is an electronic digital meade ds-114, d=114mm f=910mm f\\8 with 25mm scope and 2x barlow doubler.) previous sighting: date: may 20, 2009 exact time: 10:12 p.m. cdst my location at time of sighting: 32.751286,-98.872635 i had just stepped out to set up my telescope, when i noticed a commercial jetliner to my south, heading west at cruising altitude. suddenly a bright light appeared 10 to 12 degrees above the southern horizon, heading west below the passenger jet. i saw the object for about 2 seconds and then it was gone, having traveled approximately 45 degrees southeast to southwest. it could have traveled farther but when i first observed it, the object was temporarily blocked from view by an outbuilding. during the sighting, the object changed from red, to green, to white. when it turned white it expanded and disappeared. i could not determine size but a grain of rice at arms length might have just covered it. the object radiated a constant light (did not blink, flash or strobe). i've ruled out meteor due to the low, straight trajectory, nor have i ever witnessed one that changed colors like that. there was nothing being ejected and there was no tail on the object. it left no trail. i've ruled out any conventional aircraft as no terrestrial craft (that i know of) can fly that fast, nor was it swamp gas, weather balloon, etc. note of possible interest: the object appeared to be over, or near the county airport (4 miles ssw of my location), which has recently been quite active and hosts an aviation museum. the object could have been closer, or farther away but i had no sure way to gauge the distance. the sighting happened so quickly, that i did not have time to observe the object in greater detail, or with the telescope. it is possible that someone in the jet, or someone traveling north\\south on hwy 183 witnessed the brightly lit object before it disappeared. 1. where were you and what were you doing at the time? setting up my telescope in my back yard. 2. what made you first notice the object? i saw a light(s) that did not fit the norm. 3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it? unsure. began to rule out things it wasn't. 4. describe the object and its actions and motions. lights,straight trajectory, some deviations at end of sightings. 5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. curiosity. i knew that i was seeing something quite unusual to our airspace. as for the object near the moon, i've witnessed before, objects moving over\\above the surface of the moon. 6. how did you lose sight of the object? objects vanished, i.e., not there any more."]}
