Let me make this clear it was coming from the top of the clouds not belowand it lasted until 6:30. I would love to know if anyone saw this. It was right over PCH going to Manhattan beach from Playa del Rey, CA. I called channel 7 news and the police. The police finally got there when the sun rose and it was gone. The news... who knows. But that is how worried I was! I did grab my camera to film it but I do not have very good night camera. If you watch the film I have attached several times you can see the sky throbbing, I know this sounds crazy but I have not seen it since and I have been looking! Next time I will get in my car and go closer!"],"Summary":"Throbbing lights in the sky over LAX!","Log Number":"US-05222009-0021","Case Number":"17075","City":"Los Angeles","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.961362,+-118.431715(17075)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17075) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17075.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17075.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/20/2009 04:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
