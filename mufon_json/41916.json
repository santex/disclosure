{"Log Number":"US-08212012-0007","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was after midnight. We live in a neighborhood with a swamp behind us and we have large windows all over the back of the house. My mother was upstairs looking out her bedroom window. She thought she was seeing a blinking star util we grabbed binoculars. I looked through the binoculars only to find an object with pulsating red and green orb lights. It was far in the distance but the lights were very clear. Moments later, we noticed two more in a diagonal line. These objects seemed to be hovering. My brother's cell phone was acting up during this event. As the first one we saw appeared to ascend, a helicopter with large red flashing lights appeared much closer to our house than the unidentified objects. I went outside to attempt to get a better look and could not locate the objects again. It is possible for starts to glow red; however, it is not possible to see a green glowing star. It was all just very strange."],"City":"Commerce Township","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/21/2012 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41916.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41916.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Latitude":"42.597573","Region":"Michigan","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.597573,+-83.482362(41916)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41916) map </A>","Country":"United States","Summary":"First observed one: two more after.
