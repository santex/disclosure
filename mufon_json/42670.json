{"Region":"California","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside to have a cigarette. I noticed a bright light about 30 degrees up and to the south west. This only lasted about two seconds and the light went out. I see jets go by this area all the time. This was no jet. Most stars I see don't just go out. This was a clear night. What ever it was never came back on. Did I see a star blow up? UFO or what I don't know. I wish I could find out what it was. I have been looking at NASA and the ESA web sites but still no real answers."],"Latitude":"36.787781","Longitude":"-119.413672","Object Features":"None","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/16/2012 10:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.787781,+-119.413672(42670)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42670) map </A>","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/20/2012 12:37 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09202012-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42670.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42670.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"42670","Summary":"Object vanished, no trace or trail seen.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
