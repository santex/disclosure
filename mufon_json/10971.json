Doctors said from blowing to hard....Then I have some tiny thing in my right ear. I have always felt it and if you \"try \"to find it and place it. It feels as if it moves away. So the story is I was going to bed on night we lived on Mangels St. in San Francisco I was in my bed trying to sleep lights off maybe counting sheep. I remember a big bright light outside . We live on a street that started of at a hill. The fireball came down the hill. I was paralyzed. I tried to scream out to my brother who was sleep in the bed next to me but no words would come out. I tried to fight the feeling of not be able to move... My favorite classic car is a 56' chevy impala, low rider I pictured myself in that car. Flying.. I go blank after that. I woke up to to a panic scream. The lighter thing has happened quite a few times ."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05312008-0002","City":"San Francisco","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.78433,+-122.413396(10971)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10971) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"10971","Date of the Event":"02/05/1977 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere"}
