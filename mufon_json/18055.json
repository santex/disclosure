report a stange event that happened during the summer of 2007.this is not about a sighting of an object in the sky.its more about an unusual person i met during the coarse of conducting a cash business i operate on the streets of toronto,canada.this would be a tourist business called the \"rickshaw\".its a two wheeled cart that seats between 3-4 people the driver pushes the cart forward from behind a bar that extends out from the wheelhubs.this is done with no assistance from engines or chain pulleys.i would like to paraphrase this report to stop and make an honest admission of sorts. i am fascinated by the ufology phenomenon,i must have read at least two dozen books on the subject:j allen hynek,stanton friedman,whitley streiber,david jacobs and bud hopkins.ive evan gotten a hold of a book by eduard j. ruppelt who published a paperback in the late fiftie,(ive read it twice) he wrote of his experiences\\perceptions as head of project bluebook. on a night in mid july 2007 i was covering what is called in the biz a \"letout\" of the rock group the police,(which helps pin point the exact date;however i dont have that info at this time!!)upon reflecting on this encounter i realized that a series of incidents contributed to this situation.i hope the following details do not seem overly convaluted i think they carry a certain importance towards the understandind of this situation. that day was going badly for me because the day before i had gotten into a brutal physical confrontation with another driver for reasons that are unimportant to this reportage.the fighting left me sore and tender in the facial area and most importantly emotionally drained.for this reason it set up a crucial circumstance for the unfolding of this encounter.that is the breaking of a basic pattern related to \"rickshawing\" which is in order to solicit your services you typically face and call out to the public.instead because i was in quiet and uncommunitative state not only was i not talking i was standing behind the backside of the rickshaw blocked from view by the passerbys.not surprisingly the other runners picked up their rides and i was the only one left.resigned to the fact that his day was not going to be very profitable.i then heard a ladies soft voice from directly behind me asking if i was available for hire,startled more because i didnt want to let this opportunuty slip thru my fingers i turned quickly to see her but she turned away just as fast to move around the front of the shaw cross the bar and get herself seated.from what i could notice of her profile was that she was kind of 'plainish' shoulder lenght brown hair,basically cut. she might have been no more than forty years of age. her tunic like top was like a sweater and their was something peculiar in the tone of the purplish colouring of the cloth,what little time i had to observe of her their was something you couldnt quite define in any obvious way.as this is happening she asks to be taken into the downtown area whereever i think is the best spot.again hard to define yet something that stands out just enough you can notice it vaguely.the timber in her voice had this kind of resonance it carried a kind of 'hypnotic cadence' to it that makes you want to agree with whatever is being said.the accent could have been some sort of obscure easteran european slant to it.as i pull the bar around to position it for the street entrance another lady about ten years younger gets into the rickshaw,i give her a quick glance she seems normal enough.now its my turn to cross over the bar normally i'd kneel down with my back to my riders then pick up the bar.then walk\\run forward.but because i was'nt inside the bar of the rickshaw like normally,i was going to kneel down grab the bar then twist around and then start forward.as i go to pick up the bar i'm looking at the ground but my head is almost level with my passengers.whithin my peripheal vision i can notice something most unusual about the first lady.her eyes are enormous and pitch black with no white matter in the socket area what so ever .the impact of this observation is momentous for reasons related to my understanding stated before hand of this report.the obvious features of her face could very well mean but one thing,i was standing a few feet away from some sort of alien being.a moment in time i thought i would never believe to be a reality.it's one thing to read about it,fantasize about it.it;s impossible to describe the kind of exhilaration that takes hold of you.so instead of turning around to grip the front section of the bar to start moving forward,i put the bar back down and stand up to let her know that i am interested in talking\\confronting her.i lock eyes with the 'strange lady',for about twenty seconds or so.she and i just checked each other out and it was just an amazing thing you coudn't escape the fact the fact that behind or immersed within the dark lens of the eye cap was a cornea and pupil .one thing you can tell about someone when you first meet them is a sense of intelligence they give of thru the eyes its something that is visually apparent that gives you a strong impression of their awareness or perceptivity,(thats how i understand it anyways).if their is one thing that was alien about this person was the intensity level of that sense.it was 'astronomical'.(ha,ha),that is conveyed from this persons eyes.her eyes exuded an animated cat like zeal and ferocity.,but their was no central slit running down the middle of the pupil the way a feline would have,it just felt that way,then their was these squiggly lines shooting out from the center area.the pupil itself i have no memory for.in one respect their was a sense of playfullness about the expression and then was a sense of seriousness or evan a \"meaness\"; decisiveness,etc.there are more details i want to report at another time based any further future correspondance.thank you for reading my report."],"Summary":"person to person oddity","Region":"Ontario","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"07/14/2007 11:00 UTC","Latitude":"51.258505","Log
