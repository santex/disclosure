Before we came in I noticed a very bright \"star\" (was exactly what it looked like) zooming across the night sky. Was too slow to be a shooting star, but was only one solid light, so couldn't have been an airplane or helicopter of any kind. I pointed it out to my husband, and he said he thought it might be the space station. I went inside and looked it up to see where it was and how fast they moved. Found that it was moving way too fast to be the space station. We went back outside and it was gone, which we expected. But we then noticed that in the north, there was another \"star like\" something hovering too high to be a helicopter. It seemed to flash red occassionally, but mostly just stayed bright white. It looked like it would be getting closer, then would start to get further away again. Seemed to be attracting quite a bit of air traffic attention as well. Saw several planes circling around it that were definitely not commercial airliners, going too fast, maybe not jets, but not airliners. It is still out there and will be keeping an eye on it. Hoping someone else will see this too as clear as it is tonight."],"Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Latitude":"38.987118","Summary":"Bright like a star but occassionally flashing Red/white lights","Date Submitted":"10/24/2010 10:47 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26092.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26092.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Overland Park","There were no other sightings in Overland Park on or around October 24th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-10242010-0017","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Overland Park","Country":"United States","Case Number":"26092","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Region":"Kansas","Longitude":"-94.662482","Date of the Event":"10/24/2010 09:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply"}
