Light travelled fairly slowly west to east.I assumed it was a meteor or something similar or maybe the space station but then it came to a stand still and reversed direction east to west without moving off its original line. watched light till it appeared to move up and out of sight. no flashing lights just the constant light. Having seen a few unexplainable things in the sky before I got that tingle that this was not normal."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Brighton","There were no other sightings in Brighton on or around February 6th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United Kingdom","City":"Brighton","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"GB-02062008-0003","Latitude":"50.849091","Region":"England","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Constant Bright white light. very high travelling west east then stopped and reversed till out of viw","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"9460"}
