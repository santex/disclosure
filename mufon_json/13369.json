{"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw the Tinley Park Lights (3 lights) the second time around, then a few day later I saw only two lights slowly fly over head. I could not see the stars in-between the lights. It seemed big. I have never reported this before because I don't know the exact date or time. I am a smoker, and in trying to quit, I only smoked outside - and that is when I saw it. The sighting was after the well known Tinley lights I am now watching on TV. I can't tell you how big the lights were across, or why I could only see two lights. I do know that they were Not flares on balloons or an airplane, chopper or other aircraft flying \"insync\" with each other."],"Latitude":"41.578387","Date of the Event":"10/31/2005 01:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13369.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13369.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"red lights in sky","Longitude":"-87.780694","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Tinley Park","There were no other sightings in Tinley Park on or around October 31st 2005"],"Region":"Illinois","City":"Tinley Park","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.578387,+-87.780694(13369)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13369) map </A>","Case Number":"13369","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/31/2005 01:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-10292008-0030","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
