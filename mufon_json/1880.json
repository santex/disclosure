It was fairlylate at night, and I had just turned onto the highway after leaving a Circle Kconvenience store in the middle of town. There was a car ahead of me. All of asudden, a large bluish-silvery sphere shot down out of the sky and hovered inthe air over the highway for just a few seconds before shooting off to the west,making an L with its flight. I slammed on the brakes and the car ahead of medid also, but neither of us stopped to get out, we just drove on afterwards. Ihad never seen anything like it, and from what I understand, there arent many,if any, known flying objects that could have made such a maneuver. I felt awedby it96 it had such a beautiful color and it was so radiant! Id be curious to seeif anyone else reported it."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Date of the Event":"11/30/1987 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.816991","Summary":"A silvery-blue globe","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1880.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1880.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Payson","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"1880","Source":"MUFON"}
