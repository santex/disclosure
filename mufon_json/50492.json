{"Date Submitted":"09/07/2013 04:36 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsWell i went out to my porch to smoke a cigarette and some thing came flashing from the sky like a flash light down to me street and flashed at me. then I realized that another object had again came to visit. this thing was like breathing flashing and dimming and continued with the same over and over again, plus it was moving in a slow way then it stop. I have never seen a star act like that. I had made other reports to Samuel A Falvo. And I had tried to tell him about this. but anyway I have solid prof, I recorded this on video and at the mean time a police officer pass by and i stop him and he said it was moving,i recorded him too, he watch it for like 15 or 20 minutes then he left. I have solid prof and witness police officer who saw this on September 6 2013 Friday. I like some one to come see this a.s.a.p. thank you.."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"43.227922","Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"US-09072013-0007","City":"Rome","Summary":"I stop a police and I have a vedio with the police.....","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/06/2013 03:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"50492","Longitude":"-75.44213","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50492.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50492.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.227922,+-75.44213(50492)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50492) map </A>","Region":"New York","Sighting Duration":"04:15:10","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Rome","There were no other sightings in Rome on or around September 6th 2013"]}
