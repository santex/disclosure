it was banking hard to the left heading from northeast to southwest. that type of manuever is usually reserved for smaller craft and fighter jets, not a commercial airliner. the jet was a silver and peach color - the peach may have been a reflection of the sun. i tried to get the camera ready again but was not fast enough. total time in view was approximately six seconds. right after the jet was out of sight, a large round white object the size of a dinner plate at arm's length with a hole in the center appeared and disappeared in the exact same location as where i first saw the jet appear, or when i first noticed it. i then posted a message to the missouri mufon chat list about what was going on and after receiving some other messages put together a timeline of events. -12:15 pm - a witness called to report a giant ufo over south kansas city (see other report filed) -1:30 - 3:00 pm a ufo spotter and photographer in topeka, kansas (72 miles from kc) photographs multiple ufos in \"battle mode.\" he has been able to capture ufos on film using a special method and ab uv sunglasses. -2:00 pm - a kc mufon member reported a large number of uh-60 helicopters flying very low at treetop level at 125th and state line in south kansas city. this is definitely not a normal occurrence for that area. - 4:20 pm - i saw the large disc over downtown kc, then the plane and white disc. - 5:20 pm - a mufon field investigator saw a strange cloud with structure north of latan, mo from his vantage point across the river in kansas. - 10:30 pm - my daughter called, she was watching the skies and saw a black helicopter with no markings flying very low at tree top level in independence, mo, just a few blocks from my house. - 3:00 am sunday - st. louis, mo- a mufon field investigator and her entire neighborhood were awakened by a very loud strange banging and humming noise along with what sounded like gunfire, that lasted for several minutes. the vibration seemed to be coming from a spot in the sky. they have not identified the source yet. note: i don't know if this is related, but since it is also strange i thought i'd mention it. the next day (sunday) a big storm came in very quickly with high winds that caused a large number of power outages throughout the city and took our power out for 7 hours. just prior to the storm, i took my nikon camera outside to take some pictures as it came in. i had the camera set at 1\\200 sec without flash and multi-shot mode. i took 6 pictures in a row, then analyzed them. in one shot out of the series there are multiple orbs in my yard, and in subsequent photos there are tiny red and blue lights that can't be explained. no rain was falling at that point. after taking the photos, i went inside and the lights flickered on and off six times. i then took a nap (which is unusual for me) and was unaware that the power had gone completely off. i was in a dead sleep, and was awakened by a loud static noise with lots of voices talking at the same time coming from the radio. i sat up and looked at the radio, but the power was out so it should have been impossible for that to happen. on monday, we had two guests and a guest speaker from st. louis mufon attend our monthly meeting. after it was over we were standing outside talking and i saw a bullet-shaped white line, then a white crescent shaped object appear and dissapear very quickly. these were west of our location in westport in kansas city. no one else saw anything. i am surmising that some of these objects are things that come into view for a short period of time, and are noticed by clairvoyants like me, but not by others. perhaps they are entering or exiting wormholes, or are cloaked somehow and uncloak accidentially for a few seconds."]}
