{"Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-97.131494","divs":["sighting detailswe were standing on the corner of henderson highway and hespeler in a lot that has a couple of basketball hoops set up.my friend's little girl was laying on a cement wall beside the basketball court looking up at the sky when she noticed something unusual in the sky and asked her father what it was.all three of us were standing there pointing up in the sky at this object that we first thought was a bird. a bird usually circles and rides the updrafts when up high.this was very high up since it appeared to be just under the clouds.it was not moving ,just sitting there blinking.it was at this time that we realized we were looking at a ufo.this blinking light then started moving in a northeasterly direction towards a jet's exhaust stream when all of a sudden another one of these blinking lights popped out of the clouds and started moving towards the other blinking light.when the lights were right besides each other they popped back into the clouds right beside the jet exhaust.we thought they were gone so we turned to leave when all of a sudden something caught my peripheral vision to right of me and i saw a craft drop from the sky at a phenomenal rate of speed and then decelerate to hide behind some trees .we observed the silouette of this craft through the trees as it glided to the right of the trees towards an opening where it stopped and hovered.i think that this craft attempted to sneak up on us but we just happened to spot it dropping from the sky and glide behind the trees.i was scared shitless when i saw the silouette of this craft through the trees,i have been a ufo buff since a child and here i was watching a ufo gliding behind some trees attempting to be sneaky.this may sound like total bullshit to the public ,but it happened and i am willing to take a lie detector test or any other test to prove what we three witnessed. when this craft stopped in the clearing above some houses just feet away from traffic i knew that we were looking at the same type of craft that i have seen on unexplained mysteries .it is so hard to write this without feeling that i may meet with ridicule but i have two other witnesses who experienced exactly what i did and are willing to undergo any lie detector\\hypnosis to prove what we saw in broad daylight in the city of winnipeg.the craft that appeared in front of us hovered for what seemed like a few seconds and disappeared in a flash of bright light.as this thing hung in the air everyting around me seemed to come to a stop. dont remember hearing the sound of the traffic which was right next to me until the bright light that was being emitted fromm this craft as it hovered dissipated.one minute this thing was hanging in the air above the houses and then everything around me got very bright and then just as quickly this craft was gone in a flash.one second we wer looking at this object and then it was gone.this is totally fucking mindblowing.excuse my language ,but i don't know if i will feel normal again.after we witnessed whatever \\whomever we saw ,we left the area and crossed the street pushing our bikes until we got across the street.i asked my friend what time it was as we rode along and he replied that it was seven fourty-eight.we were in this lot for thirty-six minutes,it was only a couple of minutes from the time that we saw the blinking lights till one dropped out of the sky at a phenomenal rate of speed and then stop on a dime behind some trees.we feel that there was some time lost that we cannot explain.we could not have been standing in that lot for a half an hour staring at this craft without someone else noticing.what has happened here.are these entities able to somehow control time.any further questions regarding this incident if it is taken seriously can be answered by calling my cell phone.there are three of us who witnessed what i have described here and all of us will willingly undergo any type of lie detector test and beat it hands down\\even undergo hypnosis to uncover anything that may lie in the subconscious regarding this true sighting."],"Date Submitted":"07/28/2005
