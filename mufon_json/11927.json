It was around 9:20 in the night, with stars in the night, but no moon visible. Towards South I think (that was where all the houses were), a dim violet ball of light came into my view. It definitely did not feel like a shooting star (I have seen my share of stars,and this was not that brief). It was clearly a ball the size greater than the brightest star in the sky (Venus, is it?). The sighting wasn't for too long either. It was only for a 3 seconds or so. It moved across the sky at great speed (too fast to be an airplane). It could either be a pretty big shooting star or something unearthly. More sightings might throw the right light on what it exactly is."],"Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/04/2008 09:20 UTC","Latitude":"28.540716","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Saw a dim violet ball moving very quickly across the sky","Date of the Event":"08/04/2008 09:20 UTC"}
