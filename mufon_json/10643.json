{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe witness, Pat, was in Miami going to Sunset Drugs on 57th Ave ( Red Road) to pick up a prescription. As she turned from 104 St. to 57th Ave. she saw a glove-shaped object at treetop level over a canal. The globe had a reflective, metallic surface and a curled-back platform which extented a little highter than the center of the globe. From under the platform shone beautiful turquoise and some white lights. Pat turned the car around and followed the object which was moving slowly and then hovering over the canal. Suddenly, without turning, the object took off to the southeast at an incredible speed. Amazed, Pat went home withough picking up the prescription.
