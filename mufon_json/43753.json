I noticed that there were strangely low lights for a plane, then i realized that they weren't moving. When i first noticed they were over the intersection of bristol and center rds. in Flint. It hovered, and then decently paced began to move diagonally away from those two streets heading south west. It was dark, with constantly changing multi-colored lights, 3 actual lights, but they contineously changed colors. I was pretty shocked to see it, i actually was paying more attention to it than the road (oops) i looked down (to continue NOT driving into stuff, like oh... idk, another car, and looked back up, and it had gone."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43753.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43753.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/07/2012 02:42 UTC","Case Number":"43753"}
