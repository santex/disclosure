I left a huge smoke line across the horizon and another smoke form of question mark were it took off about 100 miles away. First I thought was plane, then rocket, then missle. Two cars pulled over that driving in the opposite direction to watch it hover. When I looked back and saw it hovering I thought I was going to die or get abducted, I started driving faster in the other direction, it starting get dark and I lost sight of it but it was the most remarkable thing I ever saw. It was a black cylinder shape object about 500 yds long and 100 yds wide and about 1000ft above the earth with 4 lights coming out of it and two were beaming at the earth.
