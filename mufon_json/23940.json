{"divs":["sighting detailsi was out in my yard sitting on the patio. i was enjoying the evening. i live near midway airport and could not help watching all the airline traffic going by as i watched the stars. that night there was an odd white light cutting through the tree line and landed just above the garage roof next door which is next to our yard. i dont know what the source of this light was but i have never seem white light basically in our yard like this. a vertical white line cutting through the trees and ending. it may be nothing but i am including it because the other lights that appeared in a very spectacular way were seen right in this lights line. as i was sitting - i observed red balls of light coming from the west in a low and straight line. the balls of light (several) every couple minutes maybe 5 to ten minutes came in as a single ball of red light. there was no noise and no faa navigation lights. the balls of light were pinkred and seemed to be glowing internally and not throwing off a light. these lights when they got to certain point started moving upward and then they started descending back down behind the tree line. these lights also got smaller to disappearing for a second or so - to then getting bigger. i watched this for a couple of times and minutes. after a couple of times of watching this and the pattern of these lights coming in and ascending and descending. i saw the lights going behind the tree but after that i could not see what or where they went. about a minute or two later i see this very bright light in the tree very low to the ground by the neighbor across the street to the north in front of me. at first i assumed it must of been the darn kids or a big truck with led headlights. but since this house is across from my yard - again -i have never even seen a car headlight or any other light coming from there. this light just got brighter and slowly moved up inside this tree. as it moved up it got bigger. when it got to the top of the tree all i could see was a huge white glare of light. it just hovered and then it turned itself on to what looked like a giant headlight from a old car with some sort of chrome surrounding it. it got scared and was ready to pee in my pants when this object started coming right towards me while i was sitting on the patio chair. i was in awe when this light came right over my head to the top of the evergreen tree next to me which is just above the roof of line the house. as this light came over it also turned on what looked like someone slapped a 2x4 on each side of this light in a v. on each side of this huge headlight on this v were lights of green maybe 8 in a row. the same on the other side but the lights were red. the lights once they turned on never blinked they were stationary. as it came above me i saw a body to this object it was a pale pearly green. there were no lights on the end or side of this object. after - this event i sat there in shock. as i was about to get up and go check out the area i see in front of me facing north in my yard just above the utility lines a object or light that was shaped in a triangle made up of not a solid object but small triangle objects that formed this. it appeared out of nowhere and it was like it materialized right in front of me. at this time this white light i had mentioned in the trees was still there and this object was lined right up to the tip of this light. when it got to the tip of the light i lit up like a purple silver color. it went into the tree where the light was coming. again - no noise, no other lights . nothing. after a while after this - maybe 1\\2 hour or so - the red balls of light started up again. doing the exact same thing. this time someone came home and witnessed these balls of light too. went back in around 11:30pm."],"trends":[],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.634155,+-89.391368(23940)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23940) map </A>","Latitude":"40.634155","Longitude":"-89.391368","Summary":"Strange light events that defy explanation.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/25/2010 03:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23940.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23940.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06252010-0010","Region":"Illinois","Case Number":"23940","Date of the Event":"05/29/2010 09:35 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
