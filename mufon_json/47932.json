IT appeared larger than a star and brighter. Moved in straight path and did n't move about. Too fast for plane and too low for a satilite.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/06/2013 05:29 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Alberta","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was fairly large and appeared larger in night sky than a star and brighter. It was not a plane and didn't have blinking lights. Seem to fly at height of plane though. I just woke up to shut bedroom sliding door due to it getting chilly. I glanced up and saw it moving accross the sky. I was not afaid. I often see satilites and this was not one. They look like a star and eventually fade as their surface is unable to reflect off sun due to position. This held consistent brightness and same speed. Was too low to be a jet. I was not afraid but thought wow."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"06/04/2013 03:26 UTC","Case Number":"47932","Latitude":"53.277962","Object Shape":"Circle","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-110.006145","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Lloydminster","Country":"Canada","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.277962,+-110.006145(47932)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47932) map </A>","Log Number":"CA-06062013-0019"}
