{"Date Submitted":"11/22/2013 12:58 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband myself and my son were headed to eat and we were just leaving our home and had our SUV sunroof open. I looked up at the beautiful sky and immediately noticed a silver reflective object up high in the sky. I don't know how high it was but my husband and son both saw it. I tried to video it as he drove all the way to our restaurant (about 10 mins) but my camera phone angle was off so after later review saw a quick blurb in which I took a still shot (attached). Anyway, I observed it the entire drive until we reached our destination and I took my eyes off it to get out of the car and it was just gone."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52375.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52375.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Chaska","There were no other sightings in Chaska on or around August 17th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-11222013-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.792625,+-93.600139(52375)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52375) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Hovering silver reflective object seen in broad daylight.","Tags":"City","Region":"Minnesota","Longitude":"-93.600139","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Chaska","Latitude":"44.792625","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"52375","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/17/2013 06:39 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle"}
