A light that could have been a distant satellite was traveling much too fast, started out high in the sky and the light throbbed as it descended toward the horizon. After this extra flash of light from the object it went faster and vanished behind the horizon. When I first saw the light I had to blink to make sure I wasn't seeing spots of light and then it was confirmed when my buddy saw the same thing. I thought it was a shooting star, but it left no trail and traveled too close to the earth to be one."],"Date of the Event":"10/14/2007 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Light was traveling fast towards horizon for about 3-5 seconds.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8144.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8144.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/14/2007 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.441787,+-123.324352(8144)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8144) map </A>","Longitude":"-123.324352","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Oregon","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
