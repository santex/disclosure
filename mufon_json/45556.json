We had just stepped out of the house. My husband picked up the camera (Nikon Cool Pix P7000) and shot a few seconds of video. We realized clouds passing over a star created the illusion of movement. The incident was unremarkable until we down loaded the video. When we watched the short clip, we noticed an object become visible between the star and the moon, which was nearly full at the time. The object appears to be three pyramids that form a triangle. It comes into view, then fades just before the camera goes off. We have viewed the video several times and and have no idea what the object might be. We did not notice anything that evening. The date and time appears to be about 1 day off, so the date is an estimate."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02032013-0018","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"12/23/2012 08:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.077318,+-112.134929(45556)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45556) map </A>","Region":"Arizona"}
