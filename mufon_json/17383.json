{"Tags":"City","Case Number":"17383","Longitude":"-78.877254","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Dark fuzzy hovering object.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"South Carolina","divs":["Sighting DetailsLaying on the beach and noticed object on the horizon above the ocean. Jokingly said it was a ufo and started filming. At first thought it might be a plane landing but object seemed to stay stationary for the most part and planes would not make there approach that close to the water that far out. As a matter of fact you can hear a jet taking off during the video so it couldn't have been another approaching plane. Object hovered for several more minutes before disappearing. Object seems to jump quite abit on frames time 14-15 sec. Done in slow motion and even though camera was a little shaky the object seems to move to the left very fast about 2 inches across the screen. I was zoomed in as close as i could get with my camera but it was at least several miles out above the ocean. Started talking with my friends again and later looked back and was gone. P.S. If you hear my friends talking about a crow on the video there was one on the beach that they were referring to and not what i was filming. Just an FYI."],"Date Submitted":"06/03/2009 10:00 UTC","City":"Myrtle Beach","Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"06/03/2009 10:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Myrtle Beach","There were no other sightings in Myrtle Beach on or around June 3rd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.69686,+-78.877254(17383)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17383) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"33.69686","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06082009-0009","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17383.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17383.html"]}
