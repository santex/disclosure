{"Date of the Event":"10/08/2007 08:12 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi was in my yard watering some newly planted trees. i sat down in my outside patio deck to enjoy the last of our warm nights. i was seated facing north towards midway airport about 3 miles away. as usual the night sky had the typical airplane traffic and the sky was fairly clear but alittle windy. while i sat in the patio i wathced the night sky and followed the airplanes as they came and went. most planes here fly fairly low due to our close proximity to the airport. as i sat, i saw directly in front of me and a little to my left a very gold\\orange light fly from the low north it was a solid color with no other colored or flashing lights on it. sometimes a plane can look one way until it hits a certain altitude and then the lights are turned on or seen. but this time that did not happen. this bright gold\\orange light from where i was sitting was the size of a mini cooper car. i got up from my seat and as it flew practically overhead and it looked saucer shaped. i thought ive never seened that before. no other lights, windows, marking, noise could be found or heard. just a solid gold\\orange object shaped like a saucer. as i tried to follow it and it was not moving that fast it just dissappeared before i could get to the front of the house. then i went inside the house and told my husband what just happned. i went back outside to roll up my water hose and decided to sit back down on the patio. again, i see something strange. i see a light coming from th north and it looked like a small type plane at first that has the strobes on it. it came to above tree top level and just stopped and hovered there. then it started to what looked like fluttering green, red, yellow, white tiny lights just fluttering\\strobing all over the sky and no plane in the middle of these lights. then these lights as a group started moving to my right, then to the left, then up and then down. when this started happening all of a sudden i see the gold\\orange light come up to the right of this fluttering object and as the gold\\orange object was ascending the fluttering object of lights just danced around it but never moved from the location in the sky. the gold\\orange light this time was the same with no other lights, windows, marking, noise. this time it was the size of a large beach ball and again it was moving slowly in the same direction overhead and very low. i couldnt beleive what i was seeing. i got up and this object slowed over me. what i saw was a round gold\\orange disc with what looked like 2 silver metal attena or leg type protrusion coming out of it on its left side over me.wow!!! i stood in awe. then while this object is still right over me a small round gold\\orange orb came out of it to its right and stayed in the sky."],"Longitude":"-87.758108","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Features":"Dome, Appendage(s)","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.710866,+-87.758108(8120)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8120) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10122007-0002","Region":"Illinois","Object Shape":"Disc, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8120.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8120.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/08/2007 08:12 UTC","Summary":"bright gold/orange saucer shaped object with return accompanied by erratic flashing orb lights.","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Oak Lawn","There were no other sightings in Oak Lawn on or around October 8th 2007"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"8120","City":"Oak Lawn","Latitude":"41.710866","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
