I got out my camera with a 35x optical 800x digital. These objects are changing colors from yellow,blue,red,orange, etc. They are moving upwards. They will be bright one minute and lose color the next. There are several at a time. Some look like balls changing colors. I have filmed them for several nights now. Tonight I again found them and it was bright red orange but in a horseshoe shape. I have video of all the sightings. Sometimes If I am filming one, while Im watching, another one will pass by. I have video of these colorfull things moving quickly and I strugglt to keep them in my view. OThers seem to float or glide. I have no reason to believe they will not be out there tommorow. I will continue to watch and video."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-83.850423","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15319","Region":"Georgia","Date Submitted":"02/05/2009 09:28 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.605892,+-83.850423(15319)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15319) map </A>","City":"Covington","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Covington","There were no other sightings in Covington on or around February 5th 2009"]}
