I am in a flight pattern near KCI airport and expected to hear sound (as all the craft I see here do) but there was none. At that altitude it appeared to be at least a mile high (if it were a plane the same size) it moved at a constant speed across the sky until it disappeared from my field of vision. It took about 15 seconds to clear my sight and was perfectly round from my vantage point. Oddly enough it was in the same flight pattern as commonly seen com-trails that are constantly in the same area here west of Kansas City."],"Log Number":"US-05312010-0011","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.104396,+-94.574757(23551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23551) map </A>","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","City":"Kansas City","Summary":"Object at higher altitude moves slowly","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/31/2010 02:19 UTC","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There was one other sighting in Kansas City on or around May 17th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-94.574757","Region":"Missouri","Date of the Event":"05/17/2010 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Case Number":"23551"}
