{"Tags":"City","Region":"Missouri","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 5:26 AM August 3, 2012 my fiance where outside facing north when we saw an object that reminded you of a star, but we realized it was moving very silently and smoothly across the sky. The light color was like a star but you could look closely and make out a circular domed object with a ring around it. The light never wavered,flickered or anything it was solid. We first saw it coming from the northwest, it traveled a straight line passing in front of us and heading southeast we watched about four minutes until you couldn't see it anymore."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-08032012-0008","Summary":"object that looked starlike silently and smoothly traveling across early morning sky.","Object Features":"Dome","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"39.005368","Case Number":"41385","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.005368,+-94.262312(41385)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41385) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/03/2012 05:28 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-94.262312","City":"Blue Springs","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41385.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41385.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41385.html"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like","Date Submitted":"08/03/2012 07:35 UTC","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Blue Springs","There was one other sighting in Blue Springs on or around August 3rd 2012"]}
