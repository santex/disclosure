Looked up in the sky over the fence line and saw a bright light in the sky, it was circular and moving in my direction. It was moving really slowly, no sounds, or anything coming from it. It was about 500 yards away and about 500 or so feet in the air, when i heard a helicopter coming from the opposite direction. The circular craft, stopped moving in my direction and went off at an angle and was gone in about 10 seconds. The helicopter was just passing over our apartments when the UFO was no longer visable. The helicopter turned in the direction the UFO was going in."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.998356,+-102.073735(24735)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24735) map </A>","Longitude":"-102.073735"}
