It was a commercial so I went outside to see what it was. I then notice there were a few more behind it, so I ran inside to get my binoculars and then grabbed my wife on the way back outside. By this time the first half dozen or so had moved to far away to see anymore. So we looked at the next 5 or so move from left to right before turning and moving away from us. When I ran inside to get the binoculars I thought they were helicopters and that we were seeing the lights from the cockpits. However when we zoomed in on them there were red or green lights as you would see on airplanes or helicopters. I would have to describe them as looking almost like a hot air ballon, but at the speed they were moving I would say thats would be impossible."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","City":"Round Rock","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Log Number":"US-08162010-0009","Region":"Texas"}
