I went outside and saw what looked to be a fireball (orb shaped) floating over and it appeared to be ascending and then at times it appear to descend. It was moving rather slow from our vantage point, but we really couldn't tell its direction or speed. Additionally, seconds before the fireball disappeared or went out- it began to flicker on and off. Perhaps the cloud cover masked the UFO as it began to rise?"],"trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There was one other sighting in New York on or around September 20th 2011"],"Summary":"ORANGE FIREBALL SPOTTED OVER STATEN ISLAND","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New York","Object Shape":"Fireball","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/20/2011 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change"}
