I didn't see any light source, but what I did see was a shock. There were three round dense white clouds in the middle of a starry sky making a very large perfect triangle. To the right of me there was a front approaching with clouds. Over a few minutes one of the three circles got sheared apart and disappeared, leaving the other two slowly drifting. My personal theory is that something very large caused this atmospheric distortion but was gone before I had a chance to look. Anyway this occurrence did not seem natural in any way.
