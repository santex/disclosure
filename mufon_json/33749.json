We were gazing up into the sky when wee both noticed what looked exactly like a star but it was moving. My friend remarked that it could possibly be a satellite. We continued to watch it moving at a moderate speed and then suddenly changed course (path like a sharp angled L). We were both stumped by this, we both thought it impossible for a satellite to change course. After that it simply disappeared. The details are sketchy in my memory, as this happened quite a few years ago. I cannot recall whether it was blinking or not, but imagine that it did. All I remember feeling was suprise."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/01/1998 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Free State","Latitude":"-27.849454","Log Number":"ZA-12012011-0009","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33749.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33749.html"],"Tags":"City"}
