I arrived home at 10:00 p.m. I watched them from the front porch. The lights were approaching toward the house with no sound. As they got closer they were pulsing until the small light became dim and turned an amber color. They began to descend toward the tree line. The lights began to pulse again. The small light became a little brighter then separated from the bigger one. With lightning speed it crossed over the tree line to the neighbors property to the South East. The bigger light then went below the tree line and out of my field of vision. I went inside the house at around 10:45 p.m."]}
