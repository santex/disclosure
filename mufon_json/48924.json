{"Longitude":"-79.497146","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out having a beer with my neighbor on his patio. We were looking at the stars and looking for plains and satelites in the skies. I noticed a plain flying from the west to the east close to the Milky Way. Then i saw the 5 glowing lights! The 4lights were in a diamond shape and the 5th light was located just behind the 4th light at the nine oclock position. They were flying faster then the plain moving from the north to the south. I saw it for about 5 seconds and was not able to point the lights out to my neighbor. The lights were at a higher elevation then the plain. The lights moved over the home and i lost site of it."],"Summary":"saw 5 lights and 4 in a diamond shape and the Fifth was on the left side from looking at the diamond from under neith","City":"Toronto","Country":"Canada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48924.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48924.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.661354,+-79.497146(48924)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48924) map </A>","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There was one other sighting in Toronto on or around July 13th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/13/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Date Submitted":"07/14/2013 12:17 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"48924","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"43.661354","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"CA-07142013-0001","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Region":"Ontario","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
