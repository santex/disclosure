{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11282009-0015","divs":["Sighting DetailsOMG... The triangle just passed over Belmont, North Carolina at around 9:00pm on this the 28th day of November 2009. I was out walking the dog when I looked up and saw white lights in the form of a V coming my way and pass overhead at an alarming increase of speed from North to South. Only four white lights were visible three uniform and one extra between the front and starboard ���wing��� side, it was amazing to see. It went over so fast I didn���t even have time to say to myself, ���I wish I had my camcorder��� before it zipped out of sight over my head and before I could swing my body around to match the direction of my eyes, and there was no noise coming from it. It was truly a fascinating watch. Charlotte Douglas airport is in Charlotte to the East of me about ten miles and this is a frequent flyover point for many incoming and outgoing flights but this was no airplane. I know it was not a flight due to it was the only one to go over head and flights take off and land in waves and not from that direction. I watch them alot. It's exact size and altitude I do not know but if I'd had time to size it, it would have been the size of my thumb and still slightly visible, maybe half the size of my palm. And now I���m more certain it isn���t the Aurora project��� wrong direction of travel..."],"Latitude":"35.228727","Object Shape":"Triangle, Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Charlotte","There were no other sightings in Charlotte on or around November 21st 2009"],"Summary":"4 Triangle Lights, 3 uniform plus 1 on starboard side","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20780.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20780.html"],"Region":"North Carolina","City":"Charlotte","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/28/2009 09:42 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.836587","Case Number":"20780","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.228727,+-80.836587(20780)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20780) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/21/2009 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
