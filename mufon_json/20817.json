I first thought it was a silver childrens balloon but this object had much more mass to it. It didn't have the flight characteristics of a balloon. It definitely wasn't \"floating\" in wind currents, it seemed to be moving in a \"purposful trajectory\". It was a trapezoidal shaped silver object about the size of a small car at 1500 ft moving at about 80-100 mph from East to West. Couldn't tell if it had lights or if the flashes were from the reflection of the sunlight. Object had no control surfaces or rotors. No visible means of propulsion. The object was spinning horizontally with reference to the ground and emitted no noise. There was no wind on the ground and am unsure what the winds were at 1500 feet. The whole event lasted about 3-4 minutes."]}
