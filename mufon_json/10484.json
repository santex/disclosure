{"Summary":"Low hovering lights, no sound","Object Features":"Window(s), Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/16/2007 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Log Number":"US-04232008-0007","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["sighting detailsi was pulling out of my mothers house, she lived in a 55+ adult community of doublew wide mobile homes in north phoenix near bell. her street name was utopia. anyway, i was going east coming out of my mothers little street when i noticed behind some of her neighbors homes in that community (in an empty field behind them) that there was this low flying series of colored lights. i thought it was a plane but realized that that would be impossible, especially for how slow and low it was going and how small the field was. tht lights were going about 15-20 miles an hour if that. so then i thought it was a helicopter and i kept wathing it as it came nearer the homes and up along side the street called utopia. i headed out of the community and onto utopia where i turned my car right (east again) towards the lights heading my way now (they were going north west). i got out of my car (it was very dark out) and i looked up at this strange \"helicopter\" as it slowly and strangley flew right over my head! if i was standing on my car top and jumped really high i just might have been able to touch it! it was large though, it couldn't have been a helicopter. i thought i seen figures too? i would like to go through hypnosis one day to find out. because it was so dark i could not make out an exact shape, but the lights were vivid and multi colored. not flashing multi colored lights like i have seen before, just solid lights. red, blue and white maybe green i really can not remember. but it went very slow and i was really curious and enamored with it, i was excited but not afraid at all. i felt like whatever was above me knew i was there. by this time it was already following utopia all the way towards the end of the street it appeared to be goping a tad bit faster. then it went over this small hill\\mountain and right over to the freeway. i realized at that very moment that it could not have been a helicopter because it made no sound, i mean nothing at all!! i got back into my car and still couldn't figure out what i had seen. i have seen ufo's before and i may even have some old reports on your site here somewhere. but that(if it was a ufo)was by far the coolest! i wasn't ever really sure, oly because what others would say. but today i have read a few other reports that were so similar especaiily ones from texas. so i knew i had to come over here and report it. also while i was typing this i remembered a dream i had about a multi colored ufo in an empty field that made no sound and was flying low and slow. i have always thought about that dream like it was teling me to look there, but i always thought it was one of the fields near my home in scottsdale. it wasn't until just now that i realize that, that dream was about this night that i am reporting now. that dream occured a long time before these lights i seen near my mom's home. i never put them together until now, oddly enough. interesting!!"],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.453927,+-112.071837(10484)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10484) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Sphere, Square, Rectagular","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around September 16th 2007"],"Latitude":"33.453927","City":"Phoenix","Date Submitted":"09/16/2007 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-112.071837","Case Number":"10484","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10484.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10484.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10484.html"],"Region":"Arizona","Source":"MUFON"}
