About 12:18am, a very thin (about average small star width against sky), white bluish very straight light streak traveled high speed about 3-6 degrees across sky 90 degrees straight up over head and went out in a small flash. Very high in altitude. Very, very mechanical in shape and action. The light streak was very mechanically straight. Not natural in appearance. No light brightness gradations, no wavey or curved action, no particles falling away, no trails left. Very blunt, straight, very mechanical streak of light that ended in flash of light of same color then disappeared. Very different from, fireball, meteor, shooting star which have gradations of brightness & direction and speed. This was very mechanically produced. Frightening to watch because of it's untaural-none fireball or meteor appearance."],"Log Number":"US-10122013-0004","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Summary":"Very thin, white bluish, short line of streaked light shot across sky ending with flash","City":"Rosemead","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Rosemead","There were no other sightings in Rosemead on or around October 11th 2013"]}
