It was dark, and no cars around. I was near the Princeton Church of God. I looked straight up, where the sound was coming from and a black triangular craft flew slowly over my head. It was heading back towards the northeast, and flying probably around 25 to 30 miles per hour. It wasn't even maybe 60 feet above my head. I didn't catch any photos or anything, but needless to say, it weirded me out."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6744.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6744.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Princeton","There were no other sightings in Princeton on or around April 2nd 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"West Virginia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.375979,+-81.099702(6744)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6744) map </A>"}
