{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was looking out the patio door towards the Southwest of our location, and noticed a very bright pulsating object in the sky. Thinking it might be a star, I asked my husband for his cellphone, so I could bring up the star chart app. that he has, alinged it up to the sky and upon viewing the screen it showed no promient star present in the area that this object was in. I stood there watching it pulsate and noticed it was starting to move at a very slow speed, at this point I ran to get my movie camera, I filmed a few minutes of it before my camera battery went dead, but watched it till it disapeared. After it diappeared a helicopter flew over the house. Upon viewing the film taken (on our big screen TV), you can see the object pulsating with some blue and it is spinning, it resembles a toy top that is spinning. With the naked eye you can not see this.
