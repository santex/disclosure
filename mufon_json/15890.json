{"Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI live approxamatley 7 miles west of Cape Caneveral AFS. I watch all of the satelittle and shuttle launches from my front yard. Last night, Mar 6 2009, I was watching the launch of the Kepler Telescope. While looking at the launch vehicle, I noticed a triangle shape of lights, flickering on and off, on the left side, north of the rocket. I had forgotten my camera, so I went inside and returned with it. When I pointed my video camera at this object, my camera did not focus, it showed a warning light to take the lens cap off, it was hanging down on it's string. I could not get any pictures or video. This object was in this position for approx 20 mins. Then I became concerned and went inside. Have you had any other reports from this area?
