Seen at County Road 16 near Taylor Drive just after 9 p.m. I stopped the car in the middle of the road, got out and looked at it. At first I thought I was seeing a reflection of headlights on my upper windshield. The movement was steady, but fast. It was traveling north at an altitude of between 5,000 and 10,000 feet and remained illuminated for about three or four seconds. It was not a meteor or a shooting star; it was a controlled movement ��� it went straight across the highest point in the sky and then vanished."],"Summary":"Light travelling straight across the sky","City":"Savage","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.779024,+-93.335461(4733)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4733) map </A>","Region":"Minnesota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4733.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4733.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/17/2006 09:10 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Savage","There were no other sightings in Savage on or around April 17th 2006"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"4733"}
