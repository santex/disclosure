Not in the \"normal\" directions that planes fly over our house. At first I thought thats a plane, but why is it flying that way? I turned around walked about 5 paces and continued looking up at the sky at the Orion constellation; about 20 seconds passed I walked back to my original place, looked up and the object was in the same place. The object had white, yellow, red and blue lights, not all flashing at the same time, however the white one was consistent. It stayed in the same location for about 2 minutes before very slowly moving west. I was mesmorized, frightened and curious. I couldn't stop watching it wondering why I could not hear sound and why it wasn't moving. The white light got brighter at times; it made me feel as though it knew I was there. It took about 10 minutes for the object to move out of site; which was not very far. There is no reason it should have taken that long to travel the distance it did. I could not tell where it went as the house next door blocked the view."],"Date Submitted":"10/16/2011 08:34 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"hovering craft with blinking lights that tired to look like a plane","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.110142","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"32634","City":"Pasadena","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32634.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32634.html"],"Region":"Maryland"}
