When i looked up there was a very ,very high plane, going very, very fast, leaving a very small contrail behind. the contrail looked like fat donuts on a thin rope. By the time i could get to a camera, the jet stream had distorted the contrail to the point it wasn't clear any longer. The plane must have been flying at 50,000 ft or more. as it was just a small dark dot in the sky."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
