{"Longitude":"-94.394691","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Arrowhead shaped gold UFO stationary with plane nearby","Log Number":"US-07312012-0008","divs":["Sighting DetailsSometime in October of 2011 my wife and I were coming home at dusk when I looked up and saw a triangle arrowhead object that was very large and a gold color. There were no lights on it. It was not reflecting sunlight because the sun was behind it out of view over the horizon. The point of the triangle was facing down and it was just sitting there. I also saw a commercial airliner heading right in its direction just to the right. I know they had to have seen it, because the object was twice their size. We arrived home and I ran inside to get my camera, but when I got back out it was gone, but the airliner was still in view. See a drawing attached. This was over Independence, Missouri"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Missouri","Date of the Event":"10/15/2011 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/31/2012 06:44 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.049223,+-94.394691(41309)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41309) map </A>","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There was one other sighting in Independence on or around October 15th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41309.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41309_submitter_file1__arrowheadcraft.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41309.html"],"City":"Independence","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"41309","Latitude":"39.049223","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City"}
