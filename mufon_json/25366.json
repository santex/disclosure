It was approx. 4:20 pm - daylight. I was in my car going to head west however when looking to make the right hand turn I turned and looked left. I saw what appeared to be a cumulus cloud like appearance moving faster than the other clouds - which were not moving at all. I thought it could be a kid toy, but there was no smoke trail. The cloud, from the ground, appeared to be about 4 ft by 4 ft. It was all cloud and I saw two lights on the bottom and one light on top of the observation. It flickered about every 2-3 seconds. The cloud appeard to almost camoflauge whatever was in the cloud. I followed it in my car for about two minutes. I lost track of it. Nobody around me seemed to have had their eye on such a peculiar sight. I know what I saw and called the local news channel when I got home... I felt crazy calling them."],"City":"Sarasota"}
