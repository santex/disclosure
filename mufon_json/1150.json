{"divs":["Sighting Details I was looking at clouds blowing through the sky. Suddenly I saw two round objects that seemed to be moving to slow for aircraft. However, their possitions would change relitave to one another very quickly. Icalled my son to come watch and he varified my sitings. We then called thecolumbus miss. air force bace and talked with flight opps. They said that theydid have flights in the area. At one time my son and my neighbors saw severalseperate objects. Only after we contacted the air forcem we saw thourghbinoculars that the objects appeared to be baloons. The strange thing is thatbefore we verified the baloons, the objects that we had seen, moved in erradicmotions and changed positions relitive to one another, to such a degree and sofast that I cant believe that is was wind currents simply moving bolloons."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.209841,+-87.569174(1150)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1150) map </A>","Country":"United States","Summary":"We think that we saw ufos","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1150.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1150.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1150.html"],"Case Number":"1150","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.569174","Latitude":"33.209841","Region":"Alabama","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/21/2001 03:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"01:59:00","Tags":"City","City":"Tuscaloosa","Date of the Event":"04/21/2001 03:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Tuscaloosa","There were no other sightings in Tuscaloosa on or around April 21st 2001"],"Log Number":"","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Other"}
