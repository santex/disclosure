{"divs":["sighting detailsi had just gone to bed at 12:30am on 6\\18\\09 and around 12:45 to 1 am i heard what sounded like helicopters hovering over our rural home. the dogs heard the noise as well and were standing by the window when previouslythey had been sleeping on the bed. i went to the window and looked out. i noticed that the motion detector light in our driveway had been activated, but i did not see anything in our driveway. as i looked up there appeared to be three very bright white lights in perfect alignment in a straight line. the fourth light, which was red\\white flashing, was a bit off to the left rear of the line. our driveway is approximately 400 feet in length and the lights extended almost the entire length of it. it moved very slowly and i could hear what sounded to me like an engine noise (low and not quite a helicopter noise as i had originally thought) consistently as it moved south over our meadow toward the hill. it did appear that the lights may have been attached to some flat metal (as in i was viewing possibly the underside of something)gray object, but i cannot be sure as we do not have street lights due to our rural location. my impression was that i was seeing the underside of a large object though. i saw no markings anywhere and it was above the tree line height wise. our tree's are very old pine trees so they are at least 50 feet tall. it took several moments for it to disappear over the hillside. the entire time the red\\white flashing lights continued to follow it. i am not sure whether the red\\white lights were physically attached to the 'object' or what the case was. my impression was that it was not attached. i've never seen anything like this before. this area is fairly rural and while we do get occasional planes flying over, i am certain this was not an airplane as the speed and noise were completely different."],"City":"Poynette","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.390264","Date of the Event":"06/18/2009 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06192009-0006","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Poynette","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Heard hovering noise, kind of like helicopter, looked out the window and saw three very bright white lights in perfect line with another red/white flashing lite off to the left side.","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.390264,+-89.402896(17546)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17546) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17546.html"],"Longitude":"-89.402896","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Wisconsin","Case Number":"17546","Date Submitted":"06/18/2009 12:00 UTC"}
