I didn't see the unidentified object at the time. Later I was reviewing my pictures and noticed the anomaly, from my position, just to the bottom right of the moon. I am not sure what this is but would like to know. I originally sent the images to the national MUFON but have heard nothing. I am submitting all the shots I have. It is the same picture I just enlarged it."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.730258","Case Number":"48209","Log Number":"US-06172013-0028","Region":"Maine","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/26/2012 12:00 UTC","City":"Standish","Longitude":"-70.60198","Summary":"Didn't see it until I happened to review the picture and noticed it.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.730258,+-70.60198(48209)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48209) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Standish","There were no other sightings in Standish on or around July 26th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48209.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48209.html"]}
