{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a light cloudy night just before 3am or rite at 3am a green orb fell at the rate of a free falling basketball but from the sky. Object was many miles away. I estimate the object was at least a half mile in diameter much larger than an asteroid or far off aircraft. This object was hidden by a thin layer of grey clouds but glowed thru the clouds there was no trail behind the falling object. This object was green in color uniformely round and had a lighter green ring around it much like a force field seen in science fiction movies. The clouds acted as a filter so I could not see the details in the green object but just the light and it appeared perfectly spherical with a fainter outter green ring like that of a shield. I was actually waiting for something to explode after it fell below the tree's on the horizon."],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.817778,+-96.943444(11723)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11723) map </A>","City":"Irving","Latitude":"32.817778","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Irving","There were no other sightings in Irving on or around July 12th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"07/12/2008 02:57 UTC","Log Number":"US-07252008-0006","Longitude":"-96.943444","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11723.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11723.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/12/2008 02:57 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Green orb fell like a basketball from the sky appeared to be green.","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"11723"}
