I have a friend who took a picture with her digital camera this past Saturday December 6 while driving down the Pacific Coast Highway. She wanted a picture of the sunset. She claims there is nothing there when she took the pic. She gave it to me to study, (Since I have a small background in film school) But was wondering if you could take a look at it.
