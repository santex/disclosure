They looked like flares, but the time of night and their proximity to the city didnt add up. The light turned green within a few seconds, leaving me no time to grab my camera phone, but as we were turning 1 orb appeared to slightly drop altitude& shift 20 degrees or so to the left. Unfortunantly, the freeway walls blocked the view until we got on the 60 2mins later, and by then whatever I saw was gone. I waited a few days looking for any news reports to clarify what I saw but, no luck. I would like to know if anyone else can relate to this or clear it up for me because I cant be the only person in AZ to have seen this!"],"Date of the Event":"03/01/2012 11:43 UTC","Longitude":"-111.890416","Object Shape":"Fireball, Triangle","Case Number":"36320","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.393375","Date Submitted":"03/08/2012 06:21 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Region":"Arizona","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03082012-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36320.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36320.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Country":"United States"}
