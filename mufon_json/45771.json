{"Longitude":"-1.432261","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside my property in Sheffield with a good friend when I looked up in the night sky and saw a slow moving object moving in a north direction from where I was stood and then it changed direction to a north east direction as though it was traveling somewhere. This object is the third one I have seen over my property in the last 2 days and they have appeared all the same. This was a very bright slow moving object with no lights or sound attached to it or emitted from it, no trail no nothing coming from it, it was not a helicopter or plain passing by this was a true and genuine UFO sighting and this is becoming more frequent. I first noticed the object which I thought was a star that slowly started moving and then slowly picked up speed but still moving slowly, both myself and my friend was in ore as we watched it change direction and then disappear into the night sky in its new direction as though it had reached its travel path and was well an truly on its way."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United Kingdom","Summary":"bright circle of light moving slowly no sound and changed direction as thought going to new location.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.446693,+-1.432261(45771)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45771) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45771.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45771.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"45771","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","City":"Sheffield","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Sheffield","There was one other sighting in Sheffield on or around February 18th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"02/18/2013 04:14 UTC","Latitude":"53.446693","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"GB-02182013-0012","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"02/18/2013 06:15 UTC"}
