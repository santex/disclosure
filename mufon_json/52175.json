It was quite some time ago but I remember it like it was yesterday. It was 1999. I was at a friend's apartment. It was in Beaverton, Oregon, Murray Hill area. It was around 7 or 8 pm. It was dusk. My friend and I were aware of several triangle shaped aircraft flying around at fairly high altitude. I felt quite a bit of fear while they were up there. They were up flying around above us for probably a couple of hours. I then decided to walk out to the back patio. I looked up and saw a large, nearly black triangle shaped craft. It had rounded corners. It was silent. Was moving at approximately 20 miles per hour. I looked at it for about 10 to 15 seconds and was extremely scared and went back inside the house. I vaguely remember my friend talking about contacting the newspaper to let them know about this but they wanted nothing to do with it. Do you know of anyone else in the Murray Hill area that has also seen these strange aircraft?"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52175.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52175.html"],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Beaverton","There were no other sightings in Beaverton on or around October 1st 1999"],"Longitude":"-122.79537","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-11112013-0008","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.491702,+-122.79537(52175)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52175) map </A>","Summary":"I walked out on the patio, looked up and saw a dark gray triangle shaped craft.","City":"Beaverton","Case Number":"52175"}
