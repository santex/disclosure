{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhilst on a family holiday, in the Scottish Highlands,I went outside to observe the sky.Being higher and less poluted it offered better viewing than what i was used to.There was also the chance to see meteorites at that time of year.The sky was brilliant as there was practically no clouds.Just after I had started searching I noticed movement coming from a south-easterly direction, which I initially thought was a shooting-star,but it kept moving in a,merged and moved on slower,steady path.As it approached a star it stopped and seemed to merge with the star for about 5 seconds,it continued to move again,changing its course towards another star where it repeated the same thing.I called on my 3 sons to I asked them to come out and see what I was looking at.I asked them what they thought it was,to which my eldest replied a satelite.I explained, in my limited knowledge,that satelites flew in a fixed orbit normally.The object moved in this zig-zag manner for another 5 minutes then disappeared behind one of the few clouds in the sky that night and never saw it again.I,ve always been open-minded about U.F.O.s but i,m leaning towards believing in them."],"Summary":"bright star-like object","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Inverness","There were no other sightings in Inverness on or around August 19th 1993"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/11/2012 12:44 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"34786","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34786.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34786.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Inverness","Country":"United Kingdom","Longitude":"-4.217311","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Log Number":"GB-01112012-0007","Region":"Scotland","Latitude":"57.482073","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=57.482073,+-4.217311(34786)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34786) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/19/1993 10:25 UTC"}
