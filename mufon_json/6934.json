{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Case Number":"6934","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas sleeping in my room. I was almost ten years old. I woke up and observed two small figures standing in my room. They were dark and silloutted and appeared to be about 4 feet tall with large heads and large eyes. I observed them for about 30 minutes. They were shadowy looking and I could not make out much detail, being that it was night time and dark in my room. They appeared intelligent and aware of me. They stood about 20 feet from me, and appeared to \"talk\" to one another silently as I watched. The did not make any sound but made gestures and movements with their arms which insinuated animation and intelligence. Sometimes they pointed at me, and they also shook their heads in various expressions which were undiscernable to me. I was relatively calm at the time but fearful after they left."],"Log Number":"US-04302007-0013","Summary":"Two unidentified humanoid bodies","Longitude":"-118.388936","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Culver City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.023222,+-118.388936(6934)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6934) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date of the Event":"08/01/1974 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/01/1974 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Culver City","There were no other sightings in Culver City on or around August 1st 1974"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6934.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6934.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.023222"}
