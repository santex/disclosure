I noticed it when I stopped at a light and it was above the signal. At first I thought it was a plane but it was not moving and had no markings, paint, or wings. I watched it for a minute till I lost it behind a apartment building, when I passed the building the object was gone. I'm use to seeing airplanes living by dfw but this was gone in 5 seconds that I lost sight of it."],"Longitude":"-96.692816","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/10/2011 12:50 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.025743,+-96.692816(28617)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28617) map </A>","Latitude":"33.025743","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28617.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28617.html"],"Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","City":"Plano"}
