The lights were parallel to each other with the one on the left somewhat dimmer the one on the right. The one on the right was very bright. They were 2 fast moving stars. They were moving faster than fighter jets with no noise. I did expect some noise since I figured they were moving faster than 500 mph. But there was none. No clouds in the sky. The speed was so fast, they just faded into the blue in a matter of seconds. I was then walking back to the east side of the house and there was acommercial jet flying in the same direction and much higher. Naturally ther was engine noise. Between the lights I saw nothing solid nothing but blue. I have been to many airshows, and I haven't seen anything that can fly that quietly."],"Date Submitted":"11/08/2012 04:29 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"2 glowing lights moving very fast from N to S","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.249469,+-82.327144(43779)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43779) map </A>","Case Number":"43779","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Sarasota","There were no other sightings in Sarasota on or around November 8th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/08/2012 03:10 UTC","City":"Sarasota","Source":"MUFON"}
