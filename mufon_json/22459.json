It looked at first glance like a fighter trainer, but as I watched it I realized it didn't have the shape of a jet. As I watched it fly over the road I noticed that it was very bright white and cigar shaped and was following close behind another object that was dark grey in color and the same shape. The two objects couldn't be more than a few hundred feet above tree level and seemed to be following a gas line clearing which runs perpendicular to the road, they were traveling at a slower \"jet type\" speed and made no noise as they passed overhead."],"Longitude":"-90.468432","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"Mississippi"}
