While driving homefrom work that night just about 1 mile from the intersection of NYS RT 13 and31, i looked through my car windows and saw the object as described,well almost.There were two blinking lights, but I couldnt see any object between them! Inotice that its easy to see aircraft lights reflecting off of a fuselage andhow the red lights of a radio tower show up the structure, but this was odd inthe the object had no outline at all against the sky or reflected light froomits own two lights. I was tempted to stop, but remembering all the ill-effectsfrom othe encounters, I thought discrection was the better part of ufo research.What was interestin also, is that as I headed home and went up hill, thatthrough certain spots through the trees I coulld see the lights, but still nowobjecy, even though I was now abouve it ,and some 4-5 miles away."],"Log Number":"","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Summary":"blinking lights near my travel route","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"43.05833","Case Number":"1172","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lenox","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
