I just stood there for awhile in amazement. To the right of this object was a dim star. I immediately ran in the house to get someone to make sure I wasnt hollusonating. They were also as amazed as I. The object made no noise. It was beautiful. Hopefully it wasn't anything bad. We brought out the camera but the Orb had went too far below the trees to catch it. Will be more prepared if theres a next time."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50880.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50880.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Woodbridge","There was one other sighting in Woodbridge on or around September 17th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Other"}
