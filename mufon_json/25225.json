When I looked over to the one area of the sky, I noticed what appeared to be a star that was blinking continually from red with white, to teal with white. It remained motionless. I went to a nearby location for a better point for viewing it and after a while, it began to lose its intensity of blinking red or green. Also, with it being after 12:30a.m. I was becoming very tired, so I gave up on watching it any longer. As far as my state of mind was at the point of seeing this object, I was wide awake and had not been under any influences of alcohol or drugs."],"Summary":"Continually changing color of star-like size: red/teal/white while remaining stagnant.","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Shermans Dale","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.325546,+-77.173927(25225)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25225) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Longitude":"-77.173927","Date of the Event":"08/28/2010 11:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25225.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25225.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"40.325546","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-08292010-0001","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
