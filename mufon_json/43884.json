The dim deep blue lights caught my eye. It was above the rooftop of the nextdoor neighbors house, although I would estimate appx 1-1.5 mi away. Moving in a Southern direction. I could see a faint outline as the lights seemed to help outline the object. Moving faster than any aircraft in this area.....except for the occasional military jet that may fly over during datime hours. I am close to Phoenix Gateway Airport but this was no plane. I am a pilot of small aircraft but this is my first time observing this type of craft in this area. By the way theere were no planes in the area at this time. Air traffic very slow to nonexistant."],"Region":"Arizona","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43884.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43884.html"],"City":"Queen Creek","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Queen Creek","There were no other sightings in Queen Creek on or around November 12th 2012"],"Longitude":"-111.589546","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"11/12/2012 09:57 UTC","Latitude":"33.181277"}
