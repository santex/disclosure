They struck me as odd at first because I don't recall ever seeing them before.... just as I was calling my husband out to look at them, one of the faded away, then the other faded away immediately after. About 10 minutes went by and I noticed alot of air traffic in that same area, i.e. planes and helicopters. (Not sure if it was just coincidence). Anyways, I was left dumbfounded as I was not sure what to think about what I just saw... I was trying so hard to rationalize it, and I just couldn't, which is why I am here reporting it. There was not a cloud in the sky at the time, planes I don't think can go that high (to appear like stars).... I don't know....."]}
