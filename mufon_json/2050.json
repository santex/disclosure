I went outside to go to thegarage, looked up because there was lightning and saw this white sphere thatkind of resembled a star in luminance. I thought it was a falling star untilit started making a humming sound like a motor,then all the sudden the soundwas high pitched. Then it took off with a blue trail behind it and i heard afaint bang sound.I didnt have time to get a camera, so I went over the scenarioa few times in my head so I would remember the experience as vividly aspossible. I was pretty calm through the whole thing. After it took off I raninside and told my dad and brother that I just saw a UFO above the garrage.I felt elated because this was the closest ive ever been to a UFO.Me and a close friend had seen something very similar about a year ago.It was on a trip to clarksdale, MS about 3000 ft in the sky and silver,sphere shaped and it took off at about the same speed as this one.It was daytime and we didnt notice any trails or sound."],"Date of the Event":"01/24/2001 07:54 UTC"}
