Before the sighting, my two sons were unaware that ufos could be seen because they believed it to be fantasy and nothing more. It was a subject that never surfaced in conversation and therefore didn't exist outside of television. What was most disturbing were the feelings of malice that was impressed upon them by the object. It was around 8pm on the 19 of March, 2012. An object of unknown size with blue and purple pulsing lights was moving from north to south along 19th avenue in central Phoenix. It was flying at an altitude low enough that all who had witnessed it felt the object was going to land. Shortly after the initial sighting began two law enforcement helicopters moved into the area in pursuit. One of the helicopters put a spotlight on the object causing it to speed off heading south toward South Mountain."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37023.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37023.html"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.469484,+-112.094565(37023)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37023) map </A>","Summary":"Low flying purple and blue pulsating object pursued by two helicopters using spotlights over Phoenix","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 3 other sightings in Phoenix on or around March 19th 2012"]}
