It slowly came to a stop in the sky and I just stared at it having no clue what it could be. There was absolutely no sound. It glowed like a bright light in the sky but also appeared to have two small tails that were glowing a very faint blueish color. It hovered there for about maybe 10-15 seconds then changed direction. It headed off east and got smaller and vanished within about another 5-10 seconds. has anybody else had a similar experience like this one?"],"Longitude":"-79.554687","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"41177","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball","Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Log Number":"US-07272012-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41177.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41177.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/27/2012 12:22 UTC"}
