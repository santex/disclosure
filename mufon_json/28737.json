{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Lights moving too slow, flashing strangely","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/21/2011 12:32 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsLights in the sky at first looked like a plane but began to flash strangely, too brightly and erratically. I noticed them and they seemed to respond to me noticing, slowing down and flashing really brightly. It could have been imagined, but they seemed to flash according to my thoughts, like responses to my internal questions. I wondered if anyone else noticed them, but couldn't tell. No other cars on the freeway seemed to slow down or respond to the sight. This was on Airport Rd, literally next to the airport, so that us probably why. But these lights, after slowing, flashing erratically, and then reversing direction, stopped and hovered without moving for at least 1 minute before I lost sight by driving out of view. They were very very low in the sky and I lost sight of them just by driving behind a shallow hill on the side of the road. I'm positive this wasn't a plane or a helicopter; it produced no noise and acted strangely."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28737.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28737.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"47.984135","Country":"United States","Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"28737","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.984135,+-122.197479(28737)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28737) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-122.197479","Date of the Event":"04/20/2011 08:35 UTC","City":"Everett","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Everett","There were no other sightings in Everett on or around April 20th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-04212011-0001"}
