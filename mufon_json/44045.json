{"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Missouri","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-94.386321","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy girlfriend and I were driving down 40 highway from Independence, MO towards Blue Springs, MO. When an object that looked like a T-Fighter from Star Wars appeared to be hovering and sequentially changing from red to green, to yellow and orange. Then it appeared NW on the left of the car and followed along side of our car. We did not experience any malfunctions of any sort with the car or our surroundings. I then convinced my girlfriend to pull the car over and the object took off going further NW away from our car. The object then proceeded to light up and flash red and yellow while hovering behind the car. I kept my eyes on it and it disappeared around 10:20 PM."],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Case Number":"44045","Summary":"huge t-fighter like object changed between varies colors and came extremely low to car driving down 40 hwy","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"Other","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There were no other sightings in Independence on or around November 19th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.034324,+-94.386321(44045)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44045) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11192012-0030","Date Submitted":"11/19/2012 11:59 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/19/2012 10:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:14:00","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44045.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44045.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.034324","City":"Independence"}
