(one accelerated from a dead stop to a speed barely visible to the eye). a couple of sightings appeared to be similar to nighttime aircraft with landing lights on and more than a dozen strobes, except the craft remained motionless in the sky for several minutes and then moved very slowly with no sound present. all sightings were observed during clear skies. the latest sighting follows: (second appearance of triangle moving stars) on 2\\2\\09 (at approximately 7:00 pm), i opened my garage and stepped outside and gazed at the stars for a few minutes on the crystal clear evening. (all appeared normal). around 7:30 pm, my son and a friend arrived to unload some furniture to store in my garage. as i walked out of the garage afterwards, i gazed up at the stars and noticed three of them that appeared out of place and arranged in a triangle pattern. as i looked up at the stars, my son���s friend asked if i saw a ufo. (he knew of my experience and had one recently of his own). i stated that i did not see a ufo, but those three stars do not belong there. as i made this statement, and the three of us observed the three stars nearly straight overhead; one of the stars started moving north west a bit faster than you would expect a high altitude jet to travel. i then made the statement that this was not a plane as there were no running lights. (just a glowing body and no sound). i then stated that it may be a satellite and ask my son and friend to keep an eye on it while i got a spotlight out of my garage. maybe it was just a coincidence, but the new spotlight that i had just put in the garage a day or two earlier and tested good, would not work when attempting to shine on the moving object in the sky. (note: the spotlight worked fine the next day). next, i retrieved a video camera from the garage just as my son and his friend stated that the object just disappeared against the clear sky. (i have seen satellites before, but never seen one as bright as this, nor have i seen a satellite just disappear against a clear sky). perhaps unrelated, but at 10 pm the same night; i was awakened from a sound sleep by an extremely load sound that lasted about 20 seconds and sounded like a jet was about to crash right on top of my house. after looking out the window and seeing nothing, i ran out the front of my house just in time to see what appeared to be a small white lear jet heading away to the south at a very low altitude. (this is the first time in eight years at this residence that i ever heard any plane within my home, let alone one loud enough to wake me during the night). other neighbors reported hearing the same noise and thought that a bomb was falling from the sky due to the screaming loud noise."],"Case Number":"15345","Date Submitted":"02/02/2009 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"30.24457","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.24457,+-93.2446(15345)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15345) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"(SECOND APPEARANCE of TRIANGLE MOVING STARS)","Date of the Event":"02/02/2009 12:00 UTC"}
