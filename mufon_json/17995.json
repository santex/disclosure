Just thought you might like to see this image while it is still on Google Streetview. I attended a funeral service at 1801 Baltic Avenue, Virginia Beach, VA yesterday, July 8th 2009. Prior to going I used Google maps to find the facility. If you spin the Streetview tool to the southeast and look over the portico you will see an interesting object. There is a Naval Air Station nearby. I flew out of there myself for many years. So there are many possibilies, but the object does not appear to be a jet, helicopter, or even a blimp. Other possibilities include a banner being towed along the beach. I ruled out a streetlight, because they can all be accounted for in the images. I can't determine the date the image was taken.
