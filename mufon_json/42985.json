Not too much attention was paid, but then we noticed that there was a small light, that seemed to be leading the trail. The closest comparable thing would be a missile launch or even a shuttle takeoff. It stood out pink on the horizon, and its vibrancy made us notice. My mother was the one who noticed the light at the tip, and we brushed it off as a plane. The trail, however, seemed far too thick. It ascended and slowly began to curve, almost identical to that of a missile. The sun was setting at this point, and eventually it faded out. As of 7:30, the thick base was still clearly visible, even against the darkened sky. If it helps at all, there was a test of the weather system, hours earlier, broadcast on the radio. Earlier in September, there was seemingly a missile launch coming from New Mexico, that left similar contrails over the valley."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were 2 other sightings in Las Vegas on or around October 2nd 2012"],"City":"Las Vegas","Log Number":"US-10022012-0021","Date of the Event":"10/02/2012 07:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42985.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42985.html"],"Region":"Nevada","Latitude":"36.216337","Summary":"{dr}Driving home from dinner, in the distance we see a light with a long trail","Date Submitted":"10/02/2012 10:47 UTC"}
