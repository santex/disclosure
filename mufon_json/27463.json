Didnt think much of it till I saw it move. It was also the color that made me notice it as it was a dim blue. I couldnt understand why a flying aircraft wouldn't have a brighter light on it. I thought this was strange so I went to my room and grabbed my camera and then proceeded to my deck to record it on film. It went back and forth then descended. It could be a helicopter in movement but there was no sound. Helicopters fly around all the time but you hear them quite clearly and this object was only 40 blocks from me. I would like to know what it was even if its just something explainable. Do helicoptors all have blinking strobs so that other craft can see it? This craft was just one blue light with no sound. I have the footage."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27463.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27463.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/20/2011 04:43 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.77964,+-122.415176(27463)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27463) map </A>","Summary":"saw the object from my deck as a blue orb.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"27463","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Fog","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-122.415176","City":"San Francisco"}
