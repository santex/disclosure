I was in the front corner bedroom which was my office. This bedroom has seen quite a bit of activity with many spirits and at one time had a portal to the other side that allowed spirits to come and go. At the time I was working on my computer and setting up a camera and took some video of the monitor. I was alone in the house and it was quiet. After I went back to review what I had captured, I noticed what looked like a being of some sort standing about 3 feet tall behind me. In the video, you can see its head moving slightly looking up at me. there was nothing in the room that would of made that shape or be mistaken as something else. I was shocked because I didnt see or feel anything at the time. I uploaded the video to the internet and shortly after my computer mysteriously crashed and was destroyed. I have not seen anything since. I added a photo captured from the video...It still freaks me out to this day."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"10/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.806066,+-96.644167(48031)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48031) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48031.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48031.html"]}
