When I looked up almost overhead I saw 2 identical white \"lights\" traveling at the same speed, constant with each other and never veering during the time I saw them. That was when I felt very dizzy for some bizarre reason and it occurred to me that they were not planes or shooting stars. There were no flashing lights or any variance in the bright glow of them. After about 30 seconds of slow but constant straight movement the one in what might be considered the front began to fade out in bits and pieces. Not just fading as a whole but fading out in bits and pieces. It seemed that I could detect faint color as it slowly disappeared before my eyes. Then the other one followed suit by also disappearing. Then they were gone. I was very excited by the way."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"2 round lights disappear","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-119.809253","Latitude":"39.530953","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7282.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7282.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO"}
