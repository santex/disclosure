{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsListen I've been watching sightings in Indiana mount up for at least 6 weeks now. Go back and look at the database you'll see. You have to understand That these sightings started in OCT '07 another one was in NOV. Someone got film on youttube from Jan. It's poor but it's there. March 6th give or take was when the sightings really started to roll in. Every week sense then there have been sightings. In Lafayette, Denver IN, Kokomo, Tipton...... Anyway I sent a friend up there to investigate and he saw something as well. The sonic boom..... That was on the news up there was the night before the earthquake. I have no doubt that these are connected. I've been checking everyday.... Like I said and nearly pooped myself when I woke up this morning with Earthquake all over my e-mail from my IN contacts. This is huge."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/16/2008 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10412.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10412.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10412.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.558726,+-85.592784(10412)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10412) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/16/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Indiana go outside and take film!","Case Number":"10412","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-85.592784","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Indiana","Log Number":"US-04192008-0001","Latitude":"40.558726","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
