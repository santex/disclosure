I first noticed a standard commercial airliner in the sky pass by overhead. Then suddenly, I seen an unusual but faint flashing light, approximately north-west, then IT appeared. Man it was really weird, an arrow shaped object (maybe 60 degrees at it's vortex) consisting of three (constant) lights at each end point, with two lights at its center. It was approximately 10k to 15k miles high and passed over my building at a rapid pace. It seemed like it did not have a solid body connecting the lights. Now, I have seen helicopters in a triangular formation. I was an avionics technician in the navy; I know how to discern different forms of aircrafts. The whole event lasted about 60 seconds. The object I saw was not of this world���.. I could not belive what I had seen. Or, can it have been an unconventional military aircraft."],"trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Arvada","There were no other sightings in Arvada on or around August 18th 2009"],"Tags":"City"}
