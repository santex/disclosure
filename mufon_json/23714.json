I was out playing hockey and I wanted to go back out. It looked as if the storm had passed on the radar, so I started to head back out. First, I glanced out the window when lightning caught my eye. I stood there and watched for a minute before I saw a black cigar shaped object hurtling through the sky. It was above the treeline, sliding at a 45 degree angle. At first, I dismissed the object as a bird, but there was a hawk flyng next to it. The hawk was shifting, but the UFO kept at a steady angle. The event lasted about 5 seconds. As soon as the sighting had occurred, I came up to my computer and wrote this report. So you can trust that the whole seen is fresh in my head and I didn't make up anything. Remember, watch th skies. P.S. I am sorry there is no attached media. I know that lessens your belief in my testimony, but I swear, it was there!!!"],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23714.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23714.html"],"Longitude":"-76.410349","Date Submitted":"06/12/2010 07:52 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"23714","City":"Salunga-Landisville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.095286,+-76.410349(23714)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23714) map </A>","Latitude":"40.095286","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/12/2010 07:27 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
