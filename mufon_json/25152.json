It was evening, the sun was setting. My roommate and I were talking when I noticed a bright object in the sky. Thinking it was a plane or some other well known cause I ignored it. Moments later I realized the object was gone. I told my roommate about it who remained skeptical. About 5 to maybe 10 minutes later the object reappeared in another part of the sky, much brighter. My roommate then noticed the object. Even though it was bright the setting sun seemed to reflect off it. Then without warning the object disappeared once more. My roommate and I contemplated as to what it could be. Then the object appeared once more in another area of the sky. There were other people at the track at the time and I'm sure my roommate and I weren't the only ones to have witnessed this object. After the third time the object didn't return but several moments later several jets flew in the vicinity of where the object was."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08212010-0007","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"25152","Date of the Event":"07/03/2010 08:00 UTC","Summary":"Bright object going disappearing and reappearing throughout the sky.","Latitude":"29.98384","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
