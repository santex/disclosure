I grabbed my binoculars and saw a star like object very high and far away but over where we had a bad fire a few days ago. The object was blinking red, green yellow, white and orange lights and never moved from where i first saw it. Then about 20 min later i saw another object to the left of the first sighting that also did the same thing and then another one appeared. They were in a triangular formation. All of this was east of Greenville, Texas. I have been watching for about an hour and 45 min and they are still in the same place and have not moved. I have never seen anything like this in my life."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.98373","Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"31731","Longitude":"-96.327982","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31731.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31731.html"],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Royse City","There was one other sighting in Royse City on or around September 11th 2011"]}
