Had to be below cloud covering just barely.I guess maybe 500ft. Called my girl friend out and she was a little freaked when she saw it.Never seen anything like that before.Definatly not a plane.It was moving slowly.Much slower than a plane would.Not a helicopter either.weird.Then it disappeared in the clouds.Watched to see if it would appear again but it didnt."],"Log Number":"US-03182013-0001"}
