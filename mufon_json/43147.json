It was quite foggy that morning, especially over the Licking River. Soon after we crossed over the river and went a short ways down the highway, the fog began to dissipate. I glanced up the hill to my right and saw a long, silver, cylindrical object hovering just outside the clouds over the hill. I was not frightened but excited. However, I did not mention the incident to my daughter as I did not want to distract her from her driving, and besides, she would never believe me. I continued to view the object until we went further down the road. I am sure that it was not the Good Year Blimp which had been seen in recent days over Cincinnati. The object's shape was that of a cylinder and not a blimp shape, and it seemed to be a little early in the morning for the blimp to be flying through the foggy sky."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.047222,+-84.4775(43147)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43147) map </A>"}
