It was a 15 hr day of hiking. At the time I wasn't aware that I had filmed anything out of the ordinary. I noticed it while showing the video to my family. I've watched it frame by frame and still havn't come to any conclusion as to what it is. The file names are the times that it appears. It happens real fast so look real close."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Keremeos","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.205278,+-119.823611(21354)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21354) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-119.823611","Region":"British Columbia","Date of the Event":"09/20/2008 11:00 UTC","Case Number":"21354","Log Number":"CA-01042010-0011"}
