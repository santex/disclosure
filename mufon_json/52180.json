{"Case Number":"52180","Country":"Canada","Region":"Quebec","divs":["sighting detailsas i was driving eastbound on the trans canada highway, toward montreal, soon after the 2 mountains bridge, still in the sainte-anne-de-bellevue township, very close to but just barely passed the address 21025 trans canada highway, when at about 11:40 pm, to my left looking north, i saw 3 lights forming a perfect triangle standing upright, 1 on top and 2 at the bottom. i was driving east doing around 100km per hour in the left lane. after a few seconds, the 3 lights began to rotate slowly and then it looked as though the entire formation moved from upright to flat, meaning that the top light of the triangle was now facing me (the road) and the 2 others that were at the bottom were on the same level on either side of the top light forming a straight horizontal path so, it then looked like 3 lights lined-up in a horizontal row: one on the left, one in the middle and the third on the right. the 3 lights were moving in unison so it got even stranger when the middle light broke away from what seemed like a solid structure (but did not see anything holding them together), and moved to the right (flying east), passing the light on the right and fly away with some distance from the other 2 who remained immobile for about 2 or 3 seconds. at that point, the other 2 immobile lights started to follow the first one in the same eastbound direction. all 3 seamed to be flying at the same speed i was (approx. 100km p\\h) and in less than a minute later, the \"leading\" light faded out to black or nothing, just disappeared slowly a bit like when you shut off a light using the slide on a dimmer. then, about 2 seconds later the other 2 lights following it just blinked-out, no fading-out but suddenly, then nothing in the sky. gone."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.403276,+-73.950361(52180)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52180) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52180.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/09/2013 11:42 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"45.403276","Date Submitted":"11/11/2013 03:22 UTC","Longitude":"-73.950361","Tags":"City","Log Number":"CA-11112013-0013","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Night sighting. 3 glowing white orbs in Triangle formation, hovering then rotated in unison, then one light separated from group and flew east and other 2 followed and then first light faded out and the other 2 blinked-out a second later."}
