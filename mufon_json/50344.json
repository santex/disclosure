Isosceles in shape I witnessed for over 5 minutes in amazement then lights turned off in quick succession one by one, at first sight I thought three Chinese lanterns but they were remained still and precise in formation and all at the same height, this could suggest a flat underside to a triangluar shaped craft or three light orbs, it was night time so only the lights were visible. I was in some shock as I had been researching phenomina at the time and called up two friends immediately with the news and went back to mine and saw many images and reports of triangle formations confirming what I had just witnessed."],"Log Number":"GB-09012013-0020","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.398325,+0.030941(50344)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50344) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"09/01/2010 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Walking home from a field the triangle formation was directly above a gas works, isocelese in shape the lights turned off one by one, at first I thought three chinese lanterns but they were so still and precise in formation","Longitude":"0.030941","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"51.398325","Region":"","Case Number":"50344","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50344.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50344.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bromley","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
