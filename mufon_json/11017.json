There are two images taken a few seconds apart. They both show a bright plasma UFO but the second one shows that some kind of plasma was ejected from the main craft. The two images are registered together using the star field so there is no relative motion between the two images. The ejected plasma cannot be due to camera motion as all relative motion has been removed."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
