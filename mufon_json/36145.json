He told me about the flight path of this ufo and it was almost exactly the same thing I witnessed back in 1975. My viewing was as follows. Our sightings are very similar. I observed a flashing light in the sky witch at first I thought was a plane traveling to Newark airport. It was only after the flashing light came to a stop directly above us high in the sky that I determined it to be a helicopter hovering. As I watched the flashing light it suddenly took off at a high rate of speed then stopped on a dime in a different location, it then did the same thing again stopping in another location on a dime. After a couple of seconds it took off at what I would describe as warp speed and vanished into the night. I'm sending the photo my friend snapped with his digital camera."],"Latitude":"40.066424","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.066424,+-74.403091(36145)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36145) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/28/2012 12:09 UTC","Summary":"My dear friend forwarded the picture of this ufo and briefly told me what he saw.","Country":"United States","Region":"New Jersey","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"36145"}
