{"divs":["Sighting Detailsit all started approximately one to one and a half years prior i was sitting on back porch and noticed a light just hovering under the clouds but thought nothing of it. but i what cought my attention was when it was back the next day it was really bright and seemed to be alot lower then the stars it was always there i started to notice that it didn't follow the same flight pattern of the stars what i mean the stars that would be next to would move with time while this light would get furthe and further away in the same amount of time i watched it for a few more days when i thought to get the video camera out and record it. what igot when i zoomed in was a light with a sphere that kind of moved slightly.but the odd thing was it had an x going threw it so i focused on a star next to it and zoomed in and it had no similarities. i would watch it out of my window and one night i was saying in my head i know your there well it appeared 3 times in a week. my two sons saw it for themselves too"],"Date Submitted":"04/14/2012 04:27 UTC","Region":"New Jersey","City":"Metuchen","Date of the Event":"07/25/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04142012-0005","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Metuchen","There was one other sighting in Metuchen on or around July 25th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37461.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37461.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"many nights of observing","Longitude":"-74.358395","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"37461","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.54988,+-74.358395(37461)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37461) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Latitude":"40.54988","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
