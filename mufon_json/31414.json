{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was with 5 people in a car coming back from fishing. We were out in the counrty near newman when all of a sudden I see a light falling from the sky. It looked like it was about to crash it was very low to the ground and made movements that a conventional aircraft is not able to do. The it came closer into few and we saw randomly blinking lights but you could tell it was a triangular shape. It the did flips and quickly hovered over a house and flashed down a bright beam of light. The lights came from 5 high powered lights on the bottom of the craft, I am a stargazer and i looked at the midnight sky all the time and I have never seen anything this close up. Then the object turned the lights off and quickly flew in the northern direction out of sight."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Date of the Event":"09/01/2011 10:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-09022011-0017","Latitude":"37.320977","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/02/2011 03:07 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.320977,+-121.012691(31414)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31414) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31414.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31414.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Triangular shaped craft. 5 bright lights on the bottom.
