I heard a low humming sound and looked up to see a triangle of bright white-blue rapidly flashing lights. The craft didn���t appear to be much bigger than a prop plane. The craft was flying slowly (25 mph) due west at a low elevation. The lights were moving in a clockwise rotation. I called my husband at home (we live 1 mile south of downtown). He went outside saw it as well, moving towards the West Salem hills. I drove home and we watched it until it made a turn north and moved slowly out of sight. I called the Salem Municipal Airport and the woman there said there were no aircraft over Salem at that time."],"Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-123.032806","City":"Salem","Latitude":"44.944668"}
