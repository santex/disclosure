I was facing east when I observed bright object in the sky headed west at extremely high speed from an eastern direction. As the object was headed west it was making sudden stops and it would disappear. The object would then reappear and continue traveling west very fast leaving behind what appeared to be a streak of light. While the object continued to travel west it disappeared for approximately 10 seconds. The object then reappeared and began to travel south.
