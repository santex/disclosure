I told my friend and we passed by the path of the ufo and stop in the middle of the road. the ufo was at that time in 8 o'clock position and was descending and approaching very slow to our location. It was huge and sound less, I could see an entity in the lower level, in the middle level lights were spinning with different colors, when the ufo was getting closer a yellow light was lighting the area, it was kind of cloudy yellow. We were observing the ufo until it stop above our head no more than 30 feet high. Next thing I remember was me getting up in a sort of spiral steps escorting by an alien behind me I think to the 2nd level. An alien almost 7 ft tall with blond hair and a colorful tight uniform was standing up just in front of me on my right side when I reached the floor level,his head was kind of upside down conical shape , , he looked and me with a friendly attitude for a moment and then he kept doing whatever he was doing. I saw another entity far away on my left side also engaged in other activity. The room was wide and spacious kind of self illuminated, the ceiling had a dome shape and the color was a intense blue similar to the sky you can see in the early morning high in the mountains. The one who was escorting me took me across the room and introduced me to a fourth alien was sitting down and greeted me with a friendly approach, I remember no have a single drop of fear. He talked to me for a while I could feel how we were moving I do not know if we were flying or just floating. After that point I can not remember anything else."],"Latitude":"-34.603278","Region":"Capital Federal","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20730.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20730.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-34.603278,+-58.370991(20730)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20730) map </A>","Summary":"Round, 3 levels, 200/300 feet diameter."}
