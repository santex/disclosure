The sky was clear, nearly clear with few if any clouds. At this time I noted what appeared to be a star (fixed point and not moving) slowly increase in brightness from nearly invisible to extremely bright. Easily the brightest object in the sky at that moment by a lot. The object then slowly decreased in brighteness from very intense to nearly invisible. The entire cycle took perhaps 30 seconds. A second cycle took place aproximately a minute later taking less than half the time of the first cycle but with the same maximum intensity and either the same location or very close to it. The object was located in the sky at ~ 45 degrees elevation and 355 degrees azmuth."],"Date Submitted":"02/06/2011 11:14 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.348236,+-121.891696(27695)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27695) map </A>","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"37.348236","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There was one other sighting in San Jose on or around February 6th 2011"],"Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"27695"}
