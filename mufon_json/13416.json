i would like mufon to look at the freeze frame shots i attached to this email. tell me what your opinion is of these. i thought, that since the ufo's were spotted and filmed during the 9\\11 attack, that this was very significant, not just to those of us in the usa, but really, to everyone in the world. the video was seen by millions, and is available to the public. considering that the 9\\11 attack on the united states was one of the most significant horrible events of all time, and considering that ufo's in mass, were reportedly present \"at the site of the 9\\11 attack, i would think that this event (i.e. 9\\11 + the ufo's) would be seen as something very significant for all of humankind. as i said, i have the original video on dvr on my tv set. if the ufo's were in fact present during the 9\\11 attack, as i believe they were, than why is there not more discussion of this? with all of the reported cases of ufo' in the literature, including that of mufon, i would expect that this event would be something that deserves a thorough investigation. what better investigators could there be, than mufon! with all of the reports of ufo's + worldwide interest in the phenomena + the sighting and filming of ufo's at the exact time of the world trade center attack, i would say that there is no better time than the present for doing a full scale investigation. if it's a fraud, then the millions of people who saw the video should be aware of that. if, on the contrary, the photo's are real and no hoax was perpetrated, than by all means, this information should be on every tv news show in the nation and the world! i just cannot understand why the ufo phenomena at the world trade center on 9\\11 is not talked about. i can't even get a response from the history channel regarding the video they showed nationally. could this be another conspiracy in the making? i'm just asking. for something this significant to the entire world, i would think that there would be tremendous interest in it. one ufo on the film is so clear that you can make out the demarcations on the craft and, can actually see the color i.e. bronze. that particular shot was taken of the ufo right in front of the world trade center after the initial attack. these craft were moving so rapidly, that i really doubt that anyone would have the sophistication and the equipment to \"fake it.\" why would they do that in the first place. there is absolutely no mention of this event in the media i.e. the ufo's that were present. if you think that this event is as important as i do, perhaps mufon can bring it to the attention of the public. i look forward to your reply. thank you for taking the time to check this out! i hope it's useful."],"Date Submitted":"09/11/2001 12:00 UTC","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10302008-0039","City":"New York","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were 6 other sightings in New York on or around September 11th 2001","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.790664,+-73.9623(13416)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13416) map </A>","Case Number":"13416","Longitude":"-73.9623"}
