[size=2][side note - i was always into these kind of things, but i remember saying then loud - oh no, i'm not going there. fear of the unknown, i guess].[\\size] ok, so here is the object - two circles of white bright round lights, smaller one a bit lower than tne bigger one. lights onn both of them were circling clockwise i think (there was some disagreement about the direction afterwards). it hovered in about 50 meters, about 200 meters from the road. after about 10 minutes it started moving along the road in the direction o marijampol��� (where we were traveling) and a little away. i started the engine and was driving for another 100 meters, then the road turns right. the object was fading as it moved, not because of the distance, but by itself. then it flied further away across the river and was still visible for some time. finally the glow of townlights hid it from our sight. i'd like to add, that that night was totally dark, but there were no clouds at all - the sky was full of stars. as for possible explanations, first thought was that it is some projection on the clouds or some light show.. but as i know that place very well, there isn't any such instalations, because its a farmland with a river valley cutting it across, no population on that side of the road whatsoever. besides, sky was clear, object was very low and bright, and last - the lights were directed to the sides and the object they were circling around, had some volume - lights were visible only in front of the object and hid behind it. i will post my humble drawing for you to understand better and will try to get google earth coordinates to show you the place."]}
