The time was approximately 4 pm and the sky clear and bright. We noticed the objects about half way across the sky or directly overhead and by the time I ran to get my camera, they had moved across most of the remaining sky and were approaching the horizon. Eventually we lost sight at what I guestimate might have been several hundred miles out (I have no idea how far one can actually see on a clear day with an object that high in the atmosphere). I'm guessing that the objects crossed the entire visible sky in 5-6 minutes or less. While the four objects were traveling at approximately the same speed and in the same direction, there were some wild variations in flight. The objects looked to be almost tumbling as they swerved back and forth, nearly impacting one another. All four of the objects left a vapor trail and I have several pictures if anyone would like to take a look. I have contacted NASA, local news agencies, local astronomy clubs, and an outfit called Space-Track.org. I have had no interest in the pictures and have been unable to find anything to suggest what it was we might have witnessed. I originally thought that the objects might have been the breakup of a satellite or something along that line, but the Space Track page that claims to track all such occurances did not even show any items in a low decay orbit within days of our sighting. The odd thing is that it appears that my freind and me may have been the only ones in our community who saw these objects. I have two clean pictures if anyone would be interested. They are fairly high resolution digital and you can zoom in for decent detail. I would just like to know what it was that we saw. If web based GPS Visualizer is correct, the sighting was at approximately: Latitude 43.578595 Longitude -116.493492 Coordinates are: N43���34.7157, W116���29.60952 I might be able to figure an approximate heading for the objects if that would be of use. I am glad to share the pictures, but I retain right of ownership."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"10/09/2007 04:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.546417,+-116.556302(9176)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9176) map </A>","Region":"Idaho","Case Number":"9176","Latitude":"43.546417","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-01232008-0004","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/09/2007 04:00 UTC","Summary":"Oct 9, 2007, 4 high altitude objects traveling erratically (tumblingh?) and very fast in same basic SE to NW trajectory."}
