It was almost a humming sound but very quiet almost as if it didnt exsist. It flew over me similiar in size to a commuter smaller wing span. Its was like a flying V... It then appeared to submerge in the ocean in the far horizon or it took off into space and its path appeared curved due to it leaving the atmosphere.
