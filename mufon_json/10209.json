A friend named Bob told me this, and these are his words: \"Around 1972 or 1973, I was driving through Oklahoma, heading towards Missouri- on an interstate highway. It was late at night and there was no traffic around me, so no headlights. A very bright ball of light came straight towards me just above the hood of my car - I saw it for a few seconds before it came to a stop at the edge of my hood, up my windshield and was gone. I was so shaken, I pulled over and got out of the car, but I had not been drinking and was wide awake, so I know it wasn't my imagination.\""],"trends":["there have been 2 other sightings in cms\\tg n\\a","there were no other sightings in cms\\tg n\\a on or around november 30th 1971"],"Longitude":"-97.084927","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
