{"Date Submitted":"06/23/2007 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsWitnessed a spinning object in sky. The object was teardrop shape. It seemed to be spinning. The top of the object seemed to have a red color which would fade in and out as it seemed to spin. I went to get my camera and when I returned the object was further away but still visible. I took some pictures and then watched the object slowly move south. Fifteen minutes later two large aircrafts began to circle the area. The aircrafts cicled at least 25 times. During this time the object was still visible from my vantage point but small. The object appeared to be in the middle of the circling planes. STRANGE.....Does anyone know what kind of airplanes these are? I took a few pics of them."],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in St Clair Shores","There were no other sightings in St Clair Shores on or around June 23rd 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"42.50053","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.50053,+-82.888944(7303)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7303) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7303.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7303_submitter_file1__objectinsky.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7303_submitter_file2__objectinsky2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7303_submitter_file3__mysteryplane2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7303.html"],"Longitude":"-82.888944","Log Number":"US-06242007-0002","Case Number":"7303","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/23/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Region":"Michigan","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"St Clair Shores","Summary":"Spinning object in sky","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
