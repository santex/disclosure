As I watched it moved the light dimmed darker and darker before you can barely see it and suddenly it shoot out the opposite direction and behind it on each side I noticed what seemed to be a wake like a speed boat speeding by and its wake in the water it leaves. And this seemed to happen in a matter of a few seconds. It seemed as if, whatever it was, was soaring up into the atmosphere then just sped into the stars when it reached space. I have seen strange moving lights once in a while in the sky but never one that behaved like this. The wake, if this was what it was, may have been caused as it was still in the atmosphere, to see an actual wake from an object speeding by."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"37.693636","Country":"United States","Region":"Kansas","Disposition":"Unknown"}
