Object hovered between trees for approx 10 seconds. It then seemed to disappear. Initially thought it was balloon or missile, except that it was hovering more than moving. Object brilliantly shiny, sun reflected off the surface. Surface was smooth, evenly colored, without texture. The center seam had evenly spaced \"bumps\" along the center of the craft. As I watched it, I seemed entraced by its reflective surface. Approximate dimensions 30-40 feet long by 35 feet diameter. Object made me feel very uneasy, as I initailly thought it was a missile. Then when I noticed it was hovering, I was more intrigued. Neighborhood sits atop a tall hill, object was hovering approx 50 feet off the ground between a stand of trees. Object made no noise; had no lights. Weather: Clear skies, 3 hours after brief summer rain storm."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.810016,+-77.044121(11969)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11969) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11969.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11969.html"],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08072008-0011","City":"Alexandria","Summary":"shiny, silver cylinder with horizontal seam sighted over residential area, suburb of DC"}
