So we went outside and could not see in the direction because the sun was so bright. So we decided to drive to his house about ten minutes away. We arrived and they were still there once i saw it we took video and caught it on my camera. We managed to watch it as it faded away in the clouds. We had about six family members witness this. My family has seen these orbs alote in this month and finally got them on camera."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/24/2010 12:00 UTC","City":"West Covina","Latitude":"34.075961","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Case Number":"21634","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01252010-0001"}
