One light would travel up & down on the right of the horizon; one would travel from the left of the horizon, slowly right, then shoot back across to the left, only to start all over again; the other light would start towards the botttom of the horizon, travel up & and the same time, come towards me, then back down. One clear, calm night I decided to see if I could attract that one. As I drove towards them through relatively empty country roads around midnight, I would flash my bright lights towards them. By the time I got to the London Ohio area, I noticed one of the lights was coming a lot closer to me. Eventually, I could make out a shape. So I stop on a dirt entry road of a local field, intentionally left my car running, lights & radio on, & got out. Whatever this thing was, it silently floated over me about 100-200 feet overhead. It was black (or dark blue. It had what I would describe as \"fat\" wings attached to a tear drop shape with no tail fins. There were port hole like lights along both \"wings\", and one spot light like on the nose of the craft & at each wing tip. The lights were pointing to the ground, but not actually making contact with the ground that I could see. While it drifted over me, I was looking straight up & made notice that there was no interruption with my car's function. This thing floated over my car & over towards Columbus. I looked back towards the other two light to see what they were doing. They haven't moved. I looked back to see the thing that went over me & it was gone - no where to be seen. This took about 1��� seconds. I have no idea where that thing went. A few days later, those light disappeared & to date, I haven't seen them again. Interesting note, I told a few friends about the lights & they verified they have seen them too, but never with the experience I had. A couple friends told me they could even see them from Interstate 70 traveling west from Columbus! Crude drawings are attached. The 'object' is basically correct, but the proportions aren't perfect. The lights on the wing tips & nose are shown as shining down to the ground."],"Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"14404","Latitude":"39.890549","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/15/1996 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.890549,+-83.446723(14404)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14404) map </A>","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14404.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14404_submitter_file1__horizon.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14404_submitter_file2__object.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14404.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.446723","Date of the Event":"08/15/1996 12:00 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Summary":"Over head","City":"London","Object Features":"Window(s), Wings"}
