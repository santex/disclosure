{"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"32682","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Details1. In my car driving from Kansas to Iowa. 2. Was hovering. 3. Airplane. 4. Looked like an airplane because of red blinking lights but suddenly stopped and hovered and red lights turned off and it came back from the way it was going. Kept moving slowly at this point until I could no longer see it because of the trees. Once the red lights went away, a green light appeared on one point of the triangular object, the rest of the lights were yellow-clear. Also had very small lights on the bottom of the object that sort of outlined the triangular shape. 5. At first I was very excited and happy that I was looking at this object. This was my second up close UFO encounter so I was anxious to pull over and take a picture but I couldn't get a good enough shot. Awhile after the sighting I started feeling nervous and my hands were shaking. I eventually calmed down. 6. Went behind trees."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-93.503011","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/17/2011 07:12 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.585765,+-93.503011(32682)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32682) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32682.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32682.html"],"Summary":"large, triangular, green and clear lights","Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Pleasant Hill","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Iowa","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"10/17/2011 11:44 UTC","Log Number":"US-10172011-0031","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Pleasant Hill","There were no other sightings in Pleasant Hill on or around October 17th 2011"],"Latitude":"41.585765"}
