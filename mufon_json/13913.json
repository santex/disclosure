(oh was i furious. haha.) my lady and i just kept talking about how strange the aircraft was, and she kept watching it as i kept driving, she said it eventually stopped moving north, and started moving straight up into the night sky. she lost sight of the beast as the drive continued. she was convinced it was some kind of ultralight aircraft, but it was so much larger, and there was nothing attached to the structure, like a glider or anything. originally i thought the object was triangular or pyramidal shaped, but it was so large and i only got to see the front half of it, so there could be much more to the back end than i realized. when i came home, i told my father all about this aircraft, and he could not think of a similar object he's ever seen in the air. so i did some research of my own, and the only thing i can come up with that is similar looking, strikingly similar, but i believe a bit larger, is the lunar landing research vehicle. i believe that's what it's called, but for your sake i will attach a picture to this report, so nobody has to go out google searching."],"Log Number":"US-11232008-0010","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Close contact with low flying UFO.","City":"Greenwood","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"11/21/2008 10:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/21/2008 10:10 UTC","Case Number":"13913","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.617528,+-86.098213(13913)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13913) map </A>"}
