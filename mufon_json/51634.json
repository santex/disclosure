{"Longitude":"-81.715864","Case Number":"51634","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs my previous report I forgot to include some details regarding the picture I took of the object,since as you would see there is 2 lights one is the object and the other light is the fountain light that seats in the middle of the Cagans Crossing's Lake.Well I will start with how me and my 16 year old son witnessed this event unfold.Me and my son were parked in the Kentucky Fried Chicken Parking lot when suddenly my son calls out for my attention to look towards Walmart.Three very bright white lights came up from the heavily wooded area behind Walmart.This three lights were pulsating as they moved towards us and moving in a zig-zagging motion.This lights went over our van and when it got over highway 27 going across to cagans crossing they stopped and hovered for a second then they went backwards hovered for a second (in a blink of an eye this lights did this),then they moved forward and kept moving towards cagans crossing.Me and my son fallowed this lights and saw as they were in motion the three lights turned into one big very bright white light in the shape of a sphere.We couldn't tell if there were any occupants or the color of the object or even the shape since this lights were blinding it like camouflaged the object.We assumed the object was in the shape of a sphere judging by the shape of this lights.Me and son fallowed the now one big light to the cagans crossing lake were it stopped.Once it stopped the light hovered over the lake about the tree top height near the fountain and then descended very slowly lower to mid three height.This light hovered about 10-15 minutes and disappeared.There was never any sound coming from this objects even after it turned into one big light and there were no other lights on it that would tell if it was a plane of any kind or a helicopter.The big bright white light in a sphere shape located on the left of the picture as you would observe is the object and the yellowish orange light sitting lower on the right side of the picture is the lake's fountain.I want to also add that this is not the only time we have witnessed strange lights or objects in this area."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51634.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51634.html"],"Summary":"UFO Sighting on Highway 27 between Walmart and Cagans Crossing in Clermont Fl","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.506515,+-81.715864(51634)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51634) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"10/14/2013 08:35 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/18/2013 12:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Clermont","There was one other sighting in Clermont on or around October 14th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-10182013-0011","City":"Clermont","Latitude":"28.506515","Object Features":"Other"}
