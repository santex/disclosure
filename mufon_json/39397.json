I looked around and saw a flashing light in the sky.It was different becasue it was out of the normal flight pattern of the jets that fly over at around 15,000 to 20,000 feet. It was white with a flashing red and blue to green lighs. My son came out to check on me and that is when he saw the objects as well. I went to get the binoculars and could see a definte red light on the side and blue green on the other. This was not a plane because of the flashing pattern that it was producing. Also it appered to be at a very high altitude. We watched for around 30 minutes before we went in side for the nght. While watching and without saying anything to my son, he noticed that the lights were moving around very quickly and asked if I saw it too or if his eyes were messing up ( I did)."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.23658,+-84.250583(39397)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39397) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-06162012-0014"}
