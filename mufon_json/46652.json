I started looking around for something else and observed this bright white object moving from SW to NE in a straight line and initially thought it was a satellite but it was far too bright to be a satellite. I started tracking it through my telescope. It was not an airplane of any sort because it was too far up and had no flashing lights or distinct shape except for being a big ball of light. I went inside and grabbed my roommate (who works at NASA and doesn't believe in the UFO phenomenon) and even he stated that it wasn't a satellite. It did not do anything extraordinary, just kind of floated across the sky until it hit the horizon. It was as bright as Jupiter, if not a little more. You couldn't have missed it if you were looking into the sky. I observed it for approximately 2 minutes before it went out of my sight. The time of the sighting was at about 8:30pm CST."],"Summary":"Bright white Orb traveling slowly across sky, as bright as Jupiter","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46652.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46652.html"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
