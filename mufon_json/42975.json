I thought it was a meteorite but very big and low. We drove down toward the direction it appeared to be going, but no sound of impact or bright glow on impact. Basically disappeared. What prompted me to wright in is, Ohio appears to had similar witnesses at the same time & date."],"Date Submitted":"10/02/2012 04:19 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/29/2012 08:36 UTC","Case Number":"42975","Latitude":"46.328461","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42975.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42975.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"North Bay"}
