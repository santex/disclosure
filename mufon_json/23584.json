Less than a sec. later I saw in the sky a bright flush of light than darkness & than way far another flush , about 6-7 skips of light flushes across the sky ! It really did looked as it skipped in big leaps , just as one would take a flat pebble & throw it on the surface of water watching the rock bounce off . They seemed extremely fast going & the direction was from North to South line . Horizon level approx. 50 * , although at the fifth skip-flush it seemed a tiny bit lower , but than it was too dark outside to be too sure . I'm really glad that the helicopter actually flew in the northern direction as the ufo was already on the south , hah ! The whole viewing experience of the lights flushes was 6 or 7 sec. only ."]}
