(comment: my wife, being a strong christian, i assume was insulted and ignored my comment. i am sure she was concerned i said this. she also does not believe in this phenomenon and i did not bring this to her attention.) i was in shock, as i have never seen a disk in person before let alone two objects at one time. i also knew we were in a position of vulnerability. we were unable to move until the traffic could move. i felt a little panic knowing this. i also wondered, were we being watched by these two floating objects? were these objects observing the cars and trucks in this backup? i then thought for a split second, there could possibly be a third object? but could not verify that assumption. i had a strong feeling, that there was a third object but could not get a good look at it. i just ���sensed it��� another presence. as the cars began to move, i was glad we could leave the area. i forced myself to brush off what i just witnessed as a not so happy observation. as i traveled down the road, i had the inclination to look one more time in my rear view mirror. sure enough, there it was in the rear view mirror where we left it. i could still see one stationary object with its lights blinking on and off near the highway. in retrospect, i now realize, two things: 1) when i saw the first object from a distance (a few miles away before the back up), the second object ���object 2��� must have been behind the other, or just showed up after we all came to a complete stop. 2) if i had not had my moon roof open and looked up when i chose to do so, i would have never seen these two objects. the angle of these objects was above and to the right of my roof. meaning, it would have been impossible for me to see these objects. the only way i would have seen these in the back up is if i was 20 or 30 cars back and was looking up to the sky in the direction of the right hand side of the highway. i know people saw this. i am sure they wish, they had not. description of two objects these objects were disk shaped. both had 5 lights along the rim. this tells me, the craft had more than five lights perhaps 15 to twenty around the entire circumference of the craft. the objects where two half���s of an inverted bowl. each craft had to be 2 to 3 inches in length from at arms length. according to my calculations this would make them approximately 80 feet long. the height of the craft would be ��� to 1\\5th of its length. this calculation assumes the objects were 200 feet from the road (us) and 500 feet in the air. estimated distance to objects from my location would be approximately 538 feet. the lights blinked on and off each second or less. one object lights seemed to reticulate in a sequence. though the sky was now dark, the lights from these objects and headlights from the backup traffic seemed to show the exterior color of these objects were ���silver���. in other words, i knew they were not black or some other color. more silver \\ light gray like coloring. report to the police given this was a major accident that occurred on i-95, and not knowing how the accident occurred. i thought the police might like to know what i saw. i first contemplated their reaction. would they think me a nut doing so? however, i rationalized after a day or two, if i saw this while driving and focused on these objects, i may have had an accident. the cars had been moving fast, the road bends and any amount of time eyes being off the road to view an unusual sight could cause a car accident. i first contacted the dispatch officer at east lyme a few days after this sighting. the dispatch officer heard my story and referred me to the investigating officer of the i-95 crash at montville. i shared the story again this time via phone voice mail to this officer. a week later, not hearing back from the officer, i decided to follow up by email to the head officer of the police station. i inquired, if they knew anything and to please share what they had heard so i could report this event to mufon. to-date, i have not been contacted. does the police know something? did others report this same event? i may never know. perhaps they think, i am a nut! conclusion i am still in shock, the memory of what i saw that evening i cannot change. what i saw that evening was both awe inspiring and scary at the same time. this was real. it was frightening and interesting all wrapped up in one event. someday i hope the government will come clean and share what they know. i was not looking for this - it was present. i will add, the following day - another witness reported a similar craft to nuforc near exit 85 (10-10-2011) a week later two witnesses submitted a similar craft near hartford to mufon."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.325376,+-72.193134(32754)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32754) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"32754","Summary":"Two disk Objects hovering near I-95 south exit 73 during back up / accident on around 7:25 pm on Oct 9 2011"}
