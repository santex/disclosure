As we watched the circlular light travel from west to east, suddenly it got really bright and discharged a bright light to the southwest. once the other light was out of sight, the orignial object dimmed into nothingness. from years of star gazing, living near multiple airports, I and my wife know this was not a usual aircraft. this was the most fantastic celistial experience of our lives. we do believe in UFOs, whether man made or extraterristrial, and tonight we know we saw an extraterristrial object."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.418034,+-111.824202(18406)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18406) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"18406"}
