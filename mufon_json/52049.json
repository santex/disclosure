Tonight for two hours whether inside or outside of our house he sat and whined at the sky or the ceiling inside the house. We had a cloudy night tonight and we could not see what he was reacting too, but what ever it was it was a signefagent amount of time for what ever was happening up in the sky above the could be going on there. He must hear a sound out of human hearing range is why I think he whines at them.
