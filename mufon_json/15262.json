I was talking to a friend outside of my parent���s house one summer night. We noticed a strange object fly and hover close to or over Grumman Aerospace site in Bethpage NY. It was a disk shaped object with a rim of flashing lights around it border. Both friend and I witnessed this object. As I said it hovered for some time over us. All at once a bright light came from the center of the craft and beemed down a pond us. I can remember that I felt that I was in a frozen state and unable to move. It felt as if my spine was frozen. I could look around but was unable to move. Then a strange thing happened it seemed that my friend was being lifted up towards the object. I myself felt that I was only a foot tall as I looked up at my friend. At this time strange enough my friend was looking down at me. All of a sudden we were back to normal and ran as fast as we could to his mom���s house. Even though we are not sure of the time of night that this took place we are sure that several hours had passed before being able to move freely again. That is all I can remember. My friend���s mom was very upset and felt that we must have been drinking or doing something else. We were not drunk or on drugs at all. We actually were the exception of the time and were drug free."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/01/1975 10:00 UTC","Case Number":"15262","Log Number":"US-02022009-0010"}
