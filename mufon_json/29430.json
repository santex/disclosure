I immediately shouted for my wife and son to come outside to see it. They instantly saw the object as it was very orange and bright. It moved south to north, silently, somewhat slower than a typical plane. The shape flowed from round to squarish to round again. Initially the object was larger and brighter, and became deeper in color and smaller. It began ascending, flickered once, then vanished in plain view. We did not lose sight of the object-- it vanished before our eyes."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Baltimore","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/06/2011 09:53 UTC"}
