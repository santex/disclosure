I can't think of why I would have stopped, pointed the camera up to the sky like I apparently did. This was around my house (Highland, CA) just before noon I believe and from what it appears I must have thought I saw something and took the pic then forgot about it or something I don't know. I discovered more photos as well showing the same object in multiple frames. Again I don't recall the incident at all. But these are my photos from a cameraphone I own and from my neighborhood."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45914.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45914.html"],"Longitude":"-117.224955","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.124616,+-117.224955(45914)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45914) map </A>","Latitude":"34.124616","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Highland","Summary":"Caught on film (unknown reason why I took photo of sky)","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
