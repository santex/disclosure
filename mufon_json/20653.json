{"Longitude":"-99.896213","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-11222009-0003","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy sister called me to come outside quickly to see the objects in the sky. By the urgency in her voice I knew something was not \"normal\". I had difficulty finding my keys to open my deadbolt lock and accidentally set off my alarm system. The alarm company called and asked if I was okay and I told them yes but I still needed a police officer because of what I was seeing in the sky. There were approx. 20 orange glowing objects moving from NE to SW over the area. They seemed to come in \"waves\" and we saw about 5-6 waves of them. A police officer arrived and stated he had seen them farther away and he stayed and watched several of the objects fly over with us. None of the people who were watching had any idea of what they were. We watched the objects for approx. 15-20 minutes before they completely left the area. Although the temperature was in the low 50's to mid 40's and I wasn't wearing a coat, I did not feel the cold. I was awestuck at the site. I could not take my eyes off of the objects. Even this morning, I can't get the images out of my mind."],"Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/22/2009 11:19 UTC","Case Number":"20653","trends":[],"Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.970839,+-99.896213(20653)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20653) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/21/2009 09:12 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20653.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20653.html"],"Summary":"Approx. 100-200 orange glowing spheres moving NE to SW over Lufkin, TX.","Latitude":"31.970839","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering"}
