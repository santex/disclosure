No cloud cover. I looked to the south and there was a silver object in the sky moving to the northeast. It was larger than a plane and very silver. My daughter was in the car with me and I told here there was an UFO. She saw it thought it might be a drone. It was silver and would flip on it's side and you could see there was nothing in the middle. The object had some type of cables or lines that were hanging out of it. The object was luminescent (very silver). I turned off of Camp Bowie to the north and tried to follow it. The entire episode was 30 seconds or a minute. Lost sight of it on Crestline as the trees blocked our view. Was a very strange experience. I do not think it was a weather balloon. I have never observed anything like it before."],"Longitude":"-97.418007","Log Number":"US-04232013-0015","Latitude":"32.759109","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
