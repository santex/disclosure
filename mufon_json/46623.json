I was fighting with my wife on the cell phone when i happened to look up and see a bright white orb looking thing over the tree line. I told Ryan to look and start recording with his cell phone. Of course he choose to shine a high powered spot light at the orb. The orb STOPPED! made 3 shape moves turned red and vanished!At first when i saw the orb i thought it was a low flying plan but when it got close it looked like a big white glowing orb is all i can explain and describe the thing. It took a lot for me to do this but im still freaked out over the whole thing."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-83.510417","Date Submitted":"04/06/2013 10:35 UTC","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
