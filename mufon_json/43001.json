There are trees that are pretty bare of leaves in the property that we face. My gf came out onto the porch. I looked out at the sky, when I noticed two bright, white lights that were horizontal to each other but the one on the right was slightly lower. I said to her, \"what is that?\" Between the tree branches you could see these bright lights in the sky that hadnt been there before. They just appeared, and gave me the impression they were traveling away from me, because there was some movement. I pointed that out to her, and she said she could see that they were a part of a solid object. I could not see this due to my eyesight is not that good anymore. The two lights (if there was any other lights the tree branches could of blocked them out)faded out like a dimmer switch. You could still see they were there but eventually were gone. I looked at the time on my cell phone and used a compass application on my cell phone to determine direction."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43001.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43001.html"],"Longitude":"-121.232233","Summary":"{dr}saw two bright white lights in the east","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-10032012-0015","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Other","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Rocklin","There were no other sightings in Rocklin on or around October 2nd 2012"],"Date Submitted":"10/03/2012 06:45 UTC"}
