I suspect that someone had been flying a large kite with LEDs attached to it. I suspect that the string holding the kite broke, and the kite actually flattened out and was carried off by the wind. I also suspect the people that were driving the cars following the object were actually the people that were flying the kite, and they were trying to recover it. I believe their intention was to perpetrate a hoax, and I feel silly for falling for it, but I had never even knew that it was possible to do something like this until I did some further research. Sorry for the false report, and thank you for your time."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.376632,+-119.008912(7615)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7615) map </A>"}
