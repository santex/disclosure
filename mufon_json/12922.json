{"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10052008-0004","divs":["Sighting DetailsFirst, my neighbor had been down at the beach which is just a few blocks from us. He saw the lights but didn't hear any sound and found it very unusal and noticed a gentlemen further down the beach just staring. He asked him if he saw the lights and the guy was relieved that my neighbor Drew had witnessed the same thing. He came back to his house and then asked me to come over and we sat in the yard looking at the sky. It was a couple hours later that it happened. First on orange glowing light that went off but another one came on. There was a total of 4 lights. There was no sound, it was a quiet evening. No other lights, nothing! He went in and ended up calling the coast guard and asked them if they were running any tests or anything and was told no. Well it wasn't very long after that an article appeared in our Sun News paper dated Novemeber 4,2005 written by Issac J Bailey A Different Perspective with the the title \"Here goes another confession\" Now I haven't a clue what it was that I saw, I just know, it wasn't flares as it was too perfect going across light to light, it wasn't a plane, there was NO sound. Again, I don't know what I saw as it went as quickly as i had appeared."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"12922","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/21/2005 12:00 UTC","Region":"South Carolina","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.824006,+-78.676316(12922)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12922) map </A>","City":"North Myrtle Beach","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in North Myrtle Beach","There were no other sightings in North Myrtle Beach on or around October 21st 2005"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12922.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12922.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"10/21/2005 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"4 bright orange lights in a row but not all at once over the atlantic","Longitude":"-78.676316","Latitude":"33.824006"}
