Coming up a hill my wife alerted me to objects in the sky straight ahead. I pulled over and we watched 3 shimmering cross like objects bouncing slowly in unison above the tree line. We watched them for about 10 - 15 seconds. I watched the two on the left drifted off to the left over the tree line. The third object on the right was being observed by my wife saw it flip over and appeared as a saucer shape. It shot off very fast heading north toward Columbia.
