I had a window seat and could see the runway in the distance. I happened to look down and say a large black teardrop shape going over the ground. That area is covered with small salt deposits and the object really stood out against the white of the salt deposit. I could tell that is was very close to the ground. It was moving very slow (almost like hovering) but was moving toward Area 51. I really believe that it was Aurora as it looked like all the artical drawings I have seen. Since I was on a commerical flight I was only able to observe the object for a very short period of time. I did not have a camera (I do carry one with me at all times now) so I did not get a picture. All the articals talk about how fast the Aurora can go so I was very surprized to see how slow it was traveling."],"Longitude":"-115.800308","Summary":"I believe that I saw Aurora.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23839.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23839.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.268011,+-115.800308(23839)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23839) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"37.268011","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/20/2010 11:09 UTC","City":"Groom Lake","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
