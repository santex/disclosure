{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was around 10:30 pm. I went out to watch some fireworks. I was looking straight south and noticed some red lights moving toward me. Initially, I thought they were glowing embers that were falling straight toward me. But I soon realized they were heading straight north, and my location had made it seem they were falling toward me. Still thinking they were embers, I kept waiting for them to fade out, but they never did. They were moving at about the speed of a helicopter or a small general aviation plane. When they passed overhead, I listened for a sound, but I heard nothing whatsoever. Since it was dark, all I could see were the lights, and nothing about the object's shape. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about aircraft, and I can't think of anything these could be, other than meteors? They had just the red light, no other colors or lights."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.69453,+-97.421098(40178)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40178) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"40178","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Wichita","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 01:16 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"Kansas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40178.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40178.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Red glowing lights fly over west Wichita","Longitude":"-97.421098","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-07052012-0016","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Wichita","There were no other sightings in Wichita on or around July 4th 2012"],"Latitude":"37.69453","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
