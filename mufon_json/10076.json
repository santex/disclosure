{"Latitude":"34.054534","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","divs":["sighting detailsi remember this vividly as if it just happened yesterday. it was circa summer of 1979' in murietta ca. it was late evening, and the sun was settling behind the mountains to the west of town into the pacific horizon. i am not certain of the exact date, i have been conducting online research trying to find more info on this incident but can't seem to find one single article related to my testimony, frustrating. but no matter, i believe my story to be noteworthy because of the mass hysteria it caused, after all it mobilized the air force and stirred the media. i have been trying to track public records of this event but yet have found none, if anyone has information on this incident please let me know. i know what i saw was in fact a ufo, because my brother remembers it just the way i do. here's the story; me and my brother and some of our playmates were playing football in the field right next to my house (note i was about eight\\nine years old). it was late evening and getting dark and the sun was setting on the pacific horizon which illuminated the sky with a bright burst of orange, yellow and red. the mountains to the west of murietta cast it's shadow over us. but being determined children we were not going to let the darkness interfere with our game. something then caught my eye. i looked to the west and right above the mountain range hovering, floating not but maybe a mile above the peak, was the most strange and most awesome object i have ever seen in my life... now first let me explain that even at that age, i knew the difference between airplanes and helo's, my oldest brother was in the army and worked on cobra helicopters, and we even went to local air shows and i will tell you now, even unto this day i have never seen nor heard of any man made air craft do, what i am about to explain that this thing did in fact do. i directed everyones attention to the object, my brother and all four of my playmates saw it. we were to young to understand what a ufo was, but we all knew what aircraft were and we were all amazed at the spectacle. it appeared as solid and as shiny as gold, as if the surface was a golden mirror that radiated it's own light. there was a line of portholes running along the length of the craft. but what was most shocking to us was that it appeared as if we were seeing shadows moving in front of the light of these portholes. as if, somthing or someone was moving about inside the craft itself, mind you these shadows were faint because the craft was far away. but these portholes were huge. it looked as if they were standing in front of these portholes taking in the view, like they were on an interstellar tour bus. the craft itself was huge, perhaps the length of three football fields. standing in central murietta ca, if you held your thumb up to the mesa de burro mountain range, the tipped ends of the ufo would peer out from either side of your thumb. this sighting lasted for about 1 to 2 minutes, and then, with no sound or warning, and without breaking the sound barrier this craft flashed in a streak headed south towards san diego. a few minutes later it streaked back towards murrieta and stopped in the exact spot that we first sighted it. my brother ran into the house to tell our parents, but they wouldn't come out because a news flash came on over the tv and reported that lax and edwards airforce base were tracking a ufo over los angeles and san diego!!! they were glued to the distraction box. the craft then streaked to the north, and was gone for several minutes and then came back, to the exact same point in the sky we first sighted it! it hovered there for a few more minutes and then streaked to the south. the speed of this craft was unreal, if you want an example i would put it's top speed near that of a polaroid camera's flash. yet you could tell which way it went because it left a brief streak of light trailing behind it. similar to a shooting star. i then went in the house and the news people on the tv were still reporting it, they verified on the air, that both lax air controllers and edwards air force base command were in fact tracking the same ufo that me, my brother and our friends witnessed. murrietta lies between edwards airforce base and camp pendleton marine base. today, being older and more mature, and a ufo novice, i believe this ufo was curious about these installations, but that's pure speculation. i wanted to share my story with you, because i feel it needs to be told and a record of such an event should be maintained. i am frustrated that i could find no record of this event on the internet, it was on the news for christ sake, and yet, it's as if it never happened. but i know somewhere the evidence is there, to prove that this incident did in fact take place as i described. i know it was a long time ago, but if anyone else is a witness to this incident, or if you have any information, your input is certainly welcomed. thank you."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-03282008-0004","Object Shape":"Cigar","Case Number":"10076","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10076.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10076.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10076.html"],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around August 31st 1979"],"Object Features":"Window(s)","Date of the Event":"08/31/1979 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/31/1979 12:00 UTC","City":"Los Angeles","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.054534,+-118.238055(10076)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10076) map </A>","Longitude":"-118.238055","Region":"California","Summary":"Murrieta CA, Cigar UFO Summer 1979."}
