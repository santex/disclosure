Coordinates: 50���45'24\"N 2���5'8\"W ). Thanks to the new smoking ban in the UK, it was deemed necessary for me to venture outside for a ciggy. All alone, and gazing at the clear night sky the constellation of the Plough caught my attention. It was at an angle of about 45 degrees to me, in a westerly direction. Suddenly, from my right side I sensed a fast moving white luminous object running e-w at a tremendous velocity. It held a steady horizontal line, no idea at the height, but it was lower than the commercial flights that skirt the village at 300 feet. No sound, no tail. My first ever sighting, hopefully not my last."],"Longitude":"-2.076603","Country":"United Kingdom","Log Number":"GB-08282007-0011","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lytchett Matravers","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"7774","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.757805,+-2.076603(7774)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7774) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7774.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7774.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"50.757805"}
