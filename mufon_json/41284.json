I pulled over on the on ramp to check my tires. I noticed a fairly bright yellow-orange light passing almost directly over head. I took a few seconfs observing it and then reached for my cell phone to take a picture. Immediately as I started to take the picture the light went out. It was fairly bright in the direction the orb was heading as the lights of Springville, NY lit up the sky. I could still see the object as it sped away, I would guess at 80 mph, because it was moving some what faster than traffic. The object then appeared as a dark object with maybe some short wings. There are no airports in the immediate direction the orb was heading. This is the eight UFO I have witnessed over my life time."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"41284","Region":"New York","City":"Springville","Log Number":"US-07302012-0019","Date of the Event":"07/30/2012 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.552829,+-78.73816(41284)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41284) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
