Suddenly I looked toward the sky and scope to see a very bright object that it was moving at an astonishing speed. The camera shot and captured a big and strange UFO. The object changed shape as he moved quickly and made a 90 degree turn and disappeared. Later, when reviewing the photo on my computer, I could distinguish several little white objects around the big one. The entire episode lasted about 5 seconds."],"Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15745.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15745_submitter_file1__IMG_2195.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15745_submitter_file2__IMG_2195.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15745_submitter_file3__IMG_2195-2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15745.html"],"Longitude":"-58.364221","Summary":"UFO over Buenos Aires, Argentina.","Date of the Event":"02/06/2009 04:33 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Capital Federal","Country":"Argentina","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"-34.601348","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-34.601348,+-58.364221(15745)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15745) map </A>","Date Submitted":"02/06/2009 04:33 UTC"}
