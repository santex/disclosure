We both saw a very bright white-colored light that was slowly moving to the east. It was the brightest object in the sky and glowing. We observed it for about two minutes when it suddenly dimmed to about half its original brightness. One minute later, the object vanished. It was a clear evening with no cloud cover. I never noticed any aircraft in the sky at the time of the observation. The object had no blinking lights like an aircraft and there was no sound. I felt very excited thinking we were observing a UFO. I was surprised we saw it for only a few minutes, hoping it would hang around for a while. After it vanished we kept looking up into the sky for more possible sightings but nothing more appeared."],"Summary":"Bright light overhead moving slowly to the east, no noise, then dimmed, then vanished","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39770.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39770.html"],"Object Shape":"Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.239777,+-122.626992(39770)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39770) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Petaluma","Date Submitted":"06/24/2012 11:48 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 10:10 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"39770","Latitude":"38.239777"}
