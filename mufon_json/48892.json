There was a clear cresent moon and a very bright star that I believe was most likely the space station. As I looked to my left I noticed something moving rather slowly and it had very bright red and white flashing lights. It couldn't have been a plane or helicopter because it was travelling too slow and it appeared to be moving with a circular motion to the Southwest. When my vision became obsured by the trees in my backyard I quickly ran to the deck and opened the door to watch it until it disappeared. There was no noise of any kind."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48892.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48892.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.363851","Date of the Event":"07/11/2013 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.363851,+-79.662232(48892)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48892) map </A>"}
