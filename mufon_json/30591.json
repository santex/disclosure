{"Region":"Montana","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe observed a bright orange light hovering above either the lake or the shoreline. The damn is about a mile from where we sat so we estimate the light was half mile away. We watched for 10 or so minutes and then the light vanished. About 5 minutes later it reappeared in the same place, it remained for about a minute and then disappeared again. About a minute later we observed the light rising from the ground or water back to about its original position. The light seemed to turn or rotate and then shot off into the night sky and quickly vanished from our sight."],"Log Number":"US-08032011-0030","Date of the Event":"07/09/2011 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30591.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30591.html"],"Longitude":"-106.417251","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.000014,+-106.417251(30591)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30591) map </A>","City":"Fort Peck Reservoir","Summary":"UFO sighting near Fort Peck Dam","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fort Peck Reservoir","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Latitude":"48.000014","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"30591","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/03/2011 12:31 UTC"}
