hard to get to, but wonderful for viewing sunsets. the weather that day was good. some clouds with cool temperatures. there was a breeze. during the last hundred meters or so, we experienced an odd crackling\\tingling sensation with the rocks (you must crawl up and over large rock sections\\faces at this point). we had never encountered this before (anywhere). not unpleasant, just strange, we passed it off as static electricity. everything else was normal. upon reaching the top, we sat, pulled out the wine, crackers, and cheese to begin our ���picnic.��� within minutes of cracking the bottle, we saw a pink light coming from the west hugging the mountains. we could not determine if it was over the valley or not, but its elevation was roughly the same as ours or slightly lower). the sun had more or less set by that time. the light came and went (not flashing, it was moving ��� sometimes pinkish, sometimes blue), blocked from full view by ridgelines beyond ours it had no discernable shape. we strained to find the object. then, as if playing a game it reappeared to our left. just as suddenly, it shifted to the right (or north) passing behind another ridgeline. again, it appeared to our left, but closer (somehow it had moved up along the side of the mountain without our seeing it ��� maybe it turned its lights off). by then, it seemed to have a shape, triangular with a reflective surface. once again, it disappeared. we waited a few minutes. as if on cue, the object reappeared to our right, much closer about 200-300 meters away. this time, its shape was clear ��� triangular (like a slice of pie) with smooth colored surface (it shimmered - maybe). no sound emanated from it. it stopped and hovered. we could not see any movement from the trees below (like propeller prop wash). the object must have been several meters long at minimum and a few meters thick, the shape of a fat piece of pie. no holes, bumps, etc. were visable. there may have been lines or shapes drawn on it. suddenly, another object appeared (from around the ridge line) sort of like the first was playing snap the whip and pulled it along. it was a white faintly glowing sphere (smaller). it disappeared behind the triangular object. the objects (one now unseen) remained in place for at least one minute, maybe two. my wife says it twinkled (i didn���t see this). then, in a flash, it backed up and around the ridgeline from where it came. we looked on hoping to see it again, when we caught a flash to our left. it reappeared where we���d previously seen it. again, only faster this time, it backtracked so quickly we could barely follow it. a few seconds later, we caught what we think was the object ���skipping��� towards the western horizon, turning right (northward) and shooting into another mountain range (across the valley). for the record, we had taken about two sips each of wine up to that final point. we were never fearful ��� more like utterly amazed. while sorely tempted (sometimes we feel as if we are crawling out of our skins), we have told no one, including family, of the event. it has changed our opinions of ufo���s (we now watch the shows on tv), and have read more on the internet. i think it was a government project. she doesn���t know what to think. previously, in 2000, we witnessed another strange event from hawksbill (another mountain in the shenandoah national park). however, it paled in comparison ��� that time an object flying straight and level in a north to south direction that flared and trailed some sort of glowing material for a second or two). we saw mufon on tv. i figured someone else may have reported a similar event on or about those dates somewhere near the park or in the valley. we will follow the mufon website in hopes of seeing something to the effect. thank you for your time and consideration."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Case Number":"13166","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13166.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13166.html"],"Region":"Virginia","Summary":"An event in the Shenandoah National Park June 2007","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"38.647896","trends":["There has been one other sighting in New Market","There were no other sightings in New Market on or around June 15th 2007"],"Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Log Number":"US-10222008-0012","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-78.671406","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.647896,+-78.671406(13166)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13166) map </A>"}
