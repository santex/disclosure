{"Longitude":"-116.203226","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhen getting home, we noticed a big bright amber object floating in the sky to the west of us. We watched it hoover in the sky for about 4 minutes moving up, down and side to side. There was no sound to it and there were no flasing lights. After a couple minutes, it started moving away from us, moving highter in the sky to the northwest. Within 30 seconds at the most, it was completely gone. It was about the size of a street slight from a block away. Very big and bring. My family and I had just gotten home from some. My 2 girls and I saw it. My oldest daughter said it kinda looked like a fireball. I noticed it as I was helping to get them out of the car. I wasn't exactly sure and still am not what it was, but it definately caught my attention and it was like something I have never seen. The direction that we saw the object was a clear view to the sky. There were no city downtown city lights, the airport is not near, etc. There are a few city lights down the street, but this object was above those."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"28418","Object Shape":"Oval","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.616841,+-116.203226(28418)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28418) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03272011-0004","Latitude":"43.616841","Summary":"Noticed a large bright amber light in the western sky","Date of the Event":"03/19/2011 10:35 UTC","Region":"Idaho","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/27/2011 12:28 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28418.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28418.html"],"City":"Boise","trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There were no other sightings in Boise on or around March 19th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
