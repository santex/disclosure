{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","divs":["Sighting Detailsprior to the event,the sighting..my sister had men in black experience at the house we had just shifted from.i went out alone at night and walked into the woods past a football ground on many nights as a child.i know i was going to the lights but to this day can not remember those nights.only coming back home would i relise id been somewhere.when it happenned to my sis i knew they were real.about yr later we shifted to an old farm house in an area i now know called'the haunted hills.where many ufos have been seen over the yrs.i was 9 yrs old when the most memorble ufo was hovering in a paddock out the back of the house we rented,half a mile away.it had just gone dark half hour before.me n older brother were out the back yard when we noticed it.i said to him'whats that machine over there?a new harvesting machine?that was my first thought.my brother said'its way rtoo big.then we noticed it was what appeared to be gliding from one end of the paddock to the other end .like it was scanning the field.little colored lights were shining on the tall grass .it sort of zig zagged as it moved towards us.thats when i noticed it had no wheels and it was hovering.it stopped a few times spinning around slowly.it seemed to just come over to us in no time,it hovered about 50-60 metres away from us,but only just hovering above the tall grass..say 6 to 10 foot from ground.we were at the paddock fence,holding onto ithe wire.my brother totolly freaked out and ran away screaming into the house for mom n dad.i was confused at his reation as i was ammazed by what i was seeing.i just stayd there mesmorised.it hoved near me and spun slowly around,blueish green lights on top but a reddish light underneath.at the corners of the disc shape where big giant windows.they had spokes that instantly reminded me of the peace sign or mercedes benze tail lights had a simalar spoke pattern.i could see wat seemed to be a person moving at one red,orange window.i felt i recognised it before and i guess thats why i had no fear of it.as my whole family ran out to see what was goin on the ufo flew off over the fence tops of the paddock and straight over tree tops.my parents got to see it zipping over the trees leaving a orange glow ass it faded over horizon of trees.hated my chick brother for givin them up that night.they might have takin me away if not for him freaking out.my sister started drawing eyes in the centre of ppls foreheads.she was only 8 yrs old.anyway ive seen many sightings since but that was a very close up encounter that still bothers me today.i know they r pychicly connected to some of us.thats why in the past i never had a problem finding them.i think ive met the bad ones but know there r good aliens too.demons n angels maybe.after the event i described b4,my parents told us not to talk to anyone at school about it.as it had happenned to mom n dad too.and back in the 60s theyd call ya nuts.but knew others it happenned to to as a kid.ill talk about my last sightings one day.thought ill start at the beginning"],"Region":"New South Wales","Log Number":"AU-06122010-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-31.594863,+147.257017(23708)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23708) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Nyngan","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Nyngan","Summary":"It was circular but domed top and bottom, lights all over, 4 big lights on each end, orange-reddish, hovering 3 to 4 meters off ground.","Latitude":"-31.594863","Date of the Event":"11/30/1968 07:04 UTC","Object Shape":"Cone, Egg, Oval","Case Number":"23708","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"147.257017","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Patterned Surface, Appendage(s), Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/12/2010 07:33 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Australia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23708.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23708.html"]}
