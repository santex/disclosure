Appeared to get closer and move away in unusual manner. Witnessed by 3 people. Same orb appeared within 10 minutes but seemed farther away. Cell phone picture taken second time but only shows small light. Seems like it was cylindrical with light or flames shooting in downward manner. All three of us had never seen anything look or move like this object was moving. We had a very clear view as we were at a campground with very little light, trees or buildings around us. Took a picture on the second visit but it only looks tiny, however looks like another smaller object is behind it that we didn't see with our own eyes. We are all normal professional people and have never seen or reported anything like this before."]}
