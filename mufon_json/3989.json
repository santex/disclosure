I was looking into the sky toward the East looking at what I believe was Saturn. I looked to the North and from nowhere appeared what I first thought was a very large bird flying at about 500 feet above the ground. The track it took was due South. The thing that first made me realize it was not a bird or plane was there was no lights and no movement of the wings. I stood up and followed the craft until it vanished. There was no sound. The sky seemed to shimmer like the way heat radiation makes light move in daylight. I got goose bumps, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I came inside and told my girlfriend. I am 48 years old. I am a Lieutenant on the fire department here where been working for 19 years. I have seen many things in the last 6-7 weeks but nothing like this. I can't speak to anyone I work with about this because they will say it is stress related due to the work we've been doing here since the storm. I know what I saw was real!"],"Log Number":"US-10152005-0001","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Wings","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-90.152852","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3989.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3989.html"]}
