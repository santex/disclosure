As I looked over across the street a bright starlike object caught my attention that was due South. It rose up then stopped. I immidiately called my Dad, the object started to move at a fast speed going north. About a minute it was very bright as it came closer and as it passed overhead. My Dad looked through the binoculars and could see flashing lights to see if it was an airplane. I also looked through the binoculars and couldn't see flashing red,green lights as on a plane.
