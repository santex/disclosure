I told him it was plane, obviously. He said ���Not the plane, where did it go?���, then exclaimed and pointed ���That!��� I leaned forward in the truck to look up into the sky thru the windshield and at the upper left side I saw a metallic disc shaped object which was brightly reflecting the sun. It was tilted at an angle toward us and didn���t seem to be moving at all but staying in one place while it tilted at those various degrees. We couldn���t tell if it made any sound or not because our windows were rolled up. I watched it for a few seconds in shock that I was seeing my first beyond a shadow of a doubt ufo , till I realized I had my camera with me and I told my husband to pull over on the side as its visibility was lost from me where I was sitting and digging in my bag for my camera. When we got to an area and pulled over it was gone and no where to be seen anywhere in the sky. We stayed there for a while looking for it and hoping it might come back or maybe still be there and show itself again, but nothing. I asked my husband about it and he said the reflection of the suns rays reflecting off of the shiny silver metal caught his eye and he look up and saw it. At that time it was completely turned on its side so that he could see it was a perfectly shaped round disk. It was so close that it was about an inch in size and we could see the grooves where it had a small bump in the middle of it. As my husband was looking at it and asking me what it was, it turned ���right��� side up where he lost it for a second then it became ���visible��� again (and when I saw it), when it tilted at an angle and the suns rays reflected off of the metallic body again. The only other ufo that I, personally have seen and video taped was when we lived 30 miles out of Kingman, Arizona which was oval shaped and light in color but was pretty far away and was reported on the news that day to be seen all over Arizona (phoenix, flagstaff, Kingman etc) but it was explained as being a weather balloon. Now that one I would accept a lot more easily as possibly being a weather balloon but this ufo we saw yesterday was so CLEAR, DETAILED and in broad DAYLIGHT on a nice sunny day that we both (my husband and I) know it was real and like nothing we both have EVER seen before that could be logically explained."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bullhead City","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.149577","Case Number":"9667","City":"Bullhead City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"UFO stationary/alternating angles in Laughlin, nv 2/16/08 at 1:50 pm","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Date of the Event":"02/16/2008 01:50 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/16/2008 01:50 UTC","Region":"Nevada","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9667.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9667_submitter_file1__sketch.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9667.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.149577,+-114.563658(9667)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9667) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown"}
