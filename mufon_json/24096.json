Ive seen alot of aircraft and these are not aircraft as most people see them. They are to fast and to high. My freinds have come over and seen them and they are now certain that iam not nuts. It is truely something to behold. The fly-overs happen all the time although some nights thry are not there. Simply put they are to dam fast for any aircraft we have and to dam high. One night we had a low one that made no noise and had one bright light in the middle of it and a ring of like fog all around it. Wish i had pictures but was to occupied with the dam thing to even think of that. This is an on-going event that seems to have no end. Most of the time they blink out after a minute or two, or right after they make a 90 degree turn or shoot straight up. Wish i had an infra red camera."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"24096","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.887752,+-93.088502(24096)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24096) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/03/2010 12:16 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Fly overs.","City":"Undisclosed"}
