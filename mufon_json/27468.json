I was just getting into my car and I saw it come down right behind the church into the tree line. It was very bright and colorful about the size of a car and exactly shaped like a tear drop. There was no sound or noise and the colors were very bright. My girlfriend happened to be outside the car standing waiting for me to back the car out and looking at the exact direction also. We could not believe what we saw. I noticed the object because it was night time and it came down before our eyes with it's large size, colors, and shape...hard not to notice."],"Longitude":"-118.378549"}
