It was a clear sky. I looked up and saw what looked like a moving star.was too bright and too close to be a satellite of any kind. It made no sound. it had no flashing aircraft lights. It was moving east southeast in a zig zag flight path. It was moving away from me. so to assume that it was a headlight on an aircraft would mean the aircraft was flying backwards which is ridiculous. eventually my view was blocked somewhat by tree tops but i continued to observe as it came to a slow stop. I walked north a few feet to get a clearer view and it started to move again in the same direction toward the east coast until my view was completely blocked and it was gone. I do not own a camera, so I couldn't capture whatever it was."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"28.251222","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in St Cloud","There were no other sightings in St Cloud on or around May 27th 2009"],"Longitude":"-81.27353","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Summary":"Bright star moving within atmosphere, zig- zag flight path.","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
