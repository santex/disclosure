I took my cell phone with me because I like taking photos or videos. Besides my cell phone was kind of new. I wanted to take a picture of the huge moon when I saw an object moving around then I put down my cell phone to make sure that it was an object hanging on the air. So instead of taking the picture I decided to make a video which lasted about 30 seconds. PS: You will see a big white light- the moon- and a smaller object - what seems to be a UFO. I'm attaching two videos but the shortest one it's the one I'm interested the most due to the object moves rapidly."],"Summary":"I saw a shining object moving around when I was in a parking lot near home in Bogota","Log Number":"CO-01102012-0008","Case Number":"34763","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,N/A","Longitude":"-74.102581"}
