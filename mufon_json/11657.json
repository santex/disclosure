We had loaded a trailer truck were locking it down in the dark truck yard when we observed a dark sphere with a row of lights flashing around it pass slowly over us from west to east. My partner commented at first that it must be some silent kind of helicopter, as there was no sound. Then two smaller orbs burst from the larger one and took off in 180 degree directions, north and south. Moments later the larger orb appeared to shoot straight UP into the night sky and disappear. We looked at each other and said we would NEVER speak about this to anyone. I have not heard from my partner in over 30 years, but I know he must remember it too."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Silent flashing sphere appeared to hover, dispatched two smaller orbs","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11657.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11657.html"],"Region":"Alabama","Date of the Event":"10/10/1973 11:15 UTC","Longitude":"-86.804878","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/10/1973 11:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
