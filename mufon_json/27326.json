They kept moving into different shapes. At first the lights made a square. When they moved into other shapes they made small explosions. I kept thinking I can't believe no one else is seeing this. When I picked up my wife I told her what I saw an pointed to where they were. She saw them too but this time there was only five or six and they were in a line. They were to far away for pictures to show up on my phone."],"Date Submitted":"01/09/2011 03:34 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Oval","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27326.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27326.html"],"Case Number":"27326"}
