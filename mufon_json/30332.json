We were looking out the window to the backyard because it was very cold, and all of a sudden we see this weird triangular UFO fly over us. It had 5 dull red \"lights\" underneath, was somewhat low and moving quickly. It was completely silent! All 3 of us saw it and were very excited that we were actually seeing this. We really wished we had a camera. It disappeared behind the roofs of other houses in the neighborhood. We tried to get a better view in our front yard, but it was gone. Definitely not a meteor or airplane!"],"Longitude":"-86.893398","Date Submitted":"08/04/2011 11:10 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"12/12/2004 12:00 UTC","Summary":"[tg] Dark triangular figure, with 5 dull","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Log Number":"US-08042011-0071","trends":[],"Case Number":"30332","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30332.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30332.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.324701,+-86.893398(30332)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30332) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
