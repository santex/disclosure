WE WENT TO SEE THE FAMOUS FALLS AND SHOP ON THE PARAGUAY SIDE OF THE BORDER AT THAT TIME THERE WERE ALWAYS MANY BRASILIANS SHOPPING THERE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T IMPORT THINGS AT THAT POLITICAL TIME. WE GOT THE LAST SEATS OF THE BUS THAT WAS FULL AND THERE WERE MANY BUSSES LEAVING AT ALMOST THE SAME TIME SINCE IT WAS NEAR CHRISTMAS AND YOU HAD A LIMIT OF $150.00 FOR EACH PERSON PER TRIP. I HAD A COLD AND MY BOYFRIEND GAVE ME AN ASPRIN AND WE SAT ON THE LAST SEATS. EVERY ONE ONBOARD CLOSED THE CURTAINS OF THEIR WINDOWS AS DID MY BOYFRIEND. BUT AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF I OPENED THE CURTAIN SINCE I LOVE THE NIGHT SKY. WE HAD ALREADY BEEN STOPPED BY THE FEDERAL POLICE TO SEARCH FOR CONTRABAND AND HAD PASSED THROUGH CASCAVEL A SMALL TOWN. NOW WE WERE ON THE MAIN HIGHWAY BR 101 WHICH IS A TWO LANE ROAD ONE COMING AND THE OTHER GOING. SOME TRUCKS AND BUSES.THE SOUTH OF BRASIL IS AN AGRICULTURAL AREA SO I SAW THE FEILDS AND OCAISIONALY A CLUSTER OF TREES, IN ONE OF THOSE CLUSTER WHICH WERE FAR APART FROM EACH OTHER I SAW A SMALL ORANGE LIGHT, SO I THOUGHT IT MUST BE THE FARM HOUSE, OK. BUT AS WECAME CLOSER THE LIGHT AND CLUSTER GOT BIGGER, OK SO WE WERE GETTING CLOSER TO THE HOUSE BUT THEN THE LIGHT GOT VERY BIGGER AND AS WE TURNED DOWN THE HIGHWAY AWAY FROM THE CLUSTER OF TREES THE LGHT KEPT BY OUR SIDE. THEN I EXCITEDLY CALLED MY BOYFRIEND AS HE WOKED UP HE CLOSED THE CURTAIN SAYING I WAS DELIRIOUS FROM MY COLD AND I KEPT TELLING HIM BUT HE DOSEN'T BELIEVE IN STRANGE THINGS AND WOULDN'T LISTEN. THEN I OPENED THE CURTAIN AGAIN AND SAD TO SEE THAT THE LIGHT WAS GONE ,SO I THOUGHT! ALL OF A SUDDEN I LOOKED TO THE ROAD DOWN BESIDE THE BUS AND I SAW THE SHADOW OF THE BUS ON THE ASFALT. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS STREET LIGHTS SINCE BRASIL HAD BEGUN TO USE THESE HORRIBLE ORANGE STREET LIGHTS. THEN I REALIZED THAT WE WERE ON THE HIGHWAY FAR FROM TOWNS AND CITIES AND AS I SAW THE LIGHT I FELT THE BUSS START TO INCREASE SPEED , I CALLED MY BOYFRIEND HE CALLED ME A NUT AND THAT I SHOULD LET THE PASSENGERS SLEEP. I LOOKED OUT AGAIN AND LIGHT WAS GONE. AT ABOUT 2 AM THE BUS STOPS TO CHANGE DRIVERS AND FOR A REST STOP. I WAS DIEING TO ASK THE DRIVER WHAT HE BUT MY BOYFRIEND KEPT RIDICULIZING ME SO I LOST MY NERVE. I'VE NEVER REGRETED SOMETHING AS MUCH AS NOT ASKING THE DRIVER WHAT HE SAW. WE REACHED RIO THE NEXT DAY WITH NO OTHER INCIDENTS. BUT I WILL NEVER FORGET"],"Log Number":"BR-04152009-0011","Region":"Parana","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Date of the Event":"12/15/1986 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
