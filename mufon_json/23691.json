During a showing of a condo with a fabulous view, I snapped a few pictures with my blackberry. I'm a licensed pilot and having learned at Toronto City Centre Airport I can guarantee that there were no aircraft coming in for landing at the time of this image. I realized today that there is a white orb in the image appearing just east of the airport in the top left-ish area of the image ! I did not notice this at the time the image was taken."]}
