It had no blinking lights except for a red light off of its side, it appeared half lit. It looked like it was maybe 50-100 feet long and even when i was close to it within like 200 feet it couldn't really make out what it was, the front was pretty lit, reminded me of a blimp but was emitting to much light and it wasn't moving when i seen it, it was kind of spinning. Additional it was night and raining when i had seen this. At first i thought it was the moon it was so bright in the front but was moving rapidly as i stated above.
