Ther have been many other people in the area that have seen them over the years. This one was really not special just like most i have seen. I had just stepped out side and like to look for meteors and other night happenings, as i left my front porch i happened to see the light coming from the NWi went back inside and got my camera to take phots and also got about a minute of vidieo. I new at once what it was since i have seen them for years. The object flew straight over my house and in a straight line. No special reactions since i am familiar with these objects. I took vidieo until the object went behind trees."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.348804,+-83.93286(43866)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43866) map </A>","City":"Tyner","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.93286","Date Submitted":"11/12/2012 04:28 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/15/2012 10:10 UTC","Latitude":"37.348804","Case Number":"43866","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Have hundreds over last forty years this is the lastest.
