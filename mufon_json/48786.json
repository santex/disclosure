When they were all in the sky they formed a triangle...constantly moving. I called my husband to see them, at this time the one to the left moved to form a straight line once more. He went to get a camera however they diappeared one at a time before we could get a picture. We're not sure if they went behind the clouds. There was thunder and lighting as this was going on. At first I thought it was fireworks but the lights went too high for fireworks This happened about 9:45pm on July 6, 2013."],"Log Number":"US-07072013-0023","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48786.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48786.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/06/2013 09:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Clearwater","There were no other sightings in Clearwater on or around July 6th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
