{"Latitude":"33.685167","divs":["Sighting DetailsI left my house for a walk, I then heard children and adults commenting on what they saw in the sky, one of the children screamed ���Alien invasion!���, which obviously drew my attention so I also looked up at the sky. There in the sky I saw three orange lights, in a triangular formation. Whatever they were, they didn���t break this formation for 3 minutes. The lights were strong and they were solid, no blinking, and they were much larger than the stars I could see. They also moved faster than any of the airplanes (blinking lights) that were outside at that time. After 3 minutes, 2 of the lights went out, and then one turned back on, and off, and the other on and off. The UFOs then went in separate directions, and the lights all disappeared."],"City":"Irvine","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"39716","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"06/21/1995 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06222012-0015","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Irvine","There were no other sightings in Irvine on or around June 21st 1995"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39716.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39716.html"],"Longitude":"-117.792274","Summary":"3 orange lights flying in formation over Orange County, CA.","Date Submitted":"06/22/2012 05:55 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.685167,+-117.792274(39716)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39716) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
