MY WIFE AND I WERE DRIVING HOME AND SAW 9 - 13 DARK ROUND OBJECTS MOVING IN UNISON HORIZONTALLY TO THE HORISON. THEY WERE AT VARYING ALTITUDES. THE SPEED OF THE OBJECTS WAS CONSTANT AND FAST. THEY WERE NOT AEROPLANES AS WE ARE USED TO SEEING THEM AROUND THIS AREA. THEY WERE NOT HOT AIR BALLOONS AS WE ARE ALSO USED TO SEEING THEM IN THIS AREA. THEY WERE UFOS. I WAS DRIVING AND COUNTED AT LEAST 9 BUT UP TO 13 OBJECTS. THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET HAPPENING AT THE TIME AND THE COLOUR OF THE OBJECTS WERE DARK AGAINST THIS SUNSET AND POSSIBILY CAUSED BY THE SUNSET. BY THE TIME WE GOT TO AN ADVANTAGE TO SEE THE LANDSCAPE I COULD ONLY OK SEE 5 OF THE OBJECTS AS THEY WERE MOVING FAST WITH NO SOUND. I LOST SIGHT OF THEM AS I FUMBLED FOR MY PHONE CAMERA. MY WIFE WATCHED THE LAST ONE DESEND INTO MOUNTAIN TERRAIN AND SHE SAW IT CHANGE COLOUR TO WHITE IN THE LAST STAGES OF DESCENT BEFORE GOING OUT OF SIGHT INTO THE MOUNTAINS. WE BOTH FELT BEWILDERED AND ARE CONVINCED THESE WERE UFOS."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There was one other sighting in Phoenix on or around March 10th 2012"],"Summary":"9 - 13 DARK OBJECTS MOVING IN HORIZONTAL UNISON, FAST, SILENT,"}
