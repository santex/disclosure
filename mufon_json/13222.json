I was unable to see anything prior to taking the photos with just my eyes. I loaded the pictures into my computer, zoomed in on them and there was something there. I'm not sure what, but there is definately something there. So I increased the pixels on my camera and loaded the date and time and went back to take more pictures. By this time the sun was setting. I took a few more pictures in the same area as the first and discovered more objects. One would appear quite large with a triangle in the center and perhaps a star in the same picture. I'm now convienced that UFO's must indeed be using the cloaking technology. I will continue this over the next several days, weather permitting."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"36.10627","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Winston-Salem","There was one other sighting in Winston-Salem on or around October 25th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-10252008-0006","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
