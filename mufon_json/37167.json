At first I thought perhaps it was a blimp, but it was not moving what-so-ever. I could kind of see colored flashing lights around it, but it didn't seem to be on the ship, rather than permeating around it. I kept staring, wondering what the heck it was, and it stayed stationary for quite a few minutes. When the prospective roommate showed up, I went to greet him, but also wanted to show him what I saw. When I took him back to the spot where I had seen the craft, it was gone. Not a trace of it. Tripped me the frick out!!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.668207,+-117.990806(37167)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37167) map </A>","Case Number":"37167","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Stationary UFO hovering in Orange County, CA","trends":["There have been 49 other sightings in Huntington Beach","There were no other sightings in Huntington Beach on or around April 6th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"04/06/2012 07:15 UTC","Latitude":"33.668207","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37167.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37167.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
