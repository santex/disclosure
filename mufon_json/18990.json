The weather was clear, and it was a dark night. The lights resembled the engines of a four-engine aircraft (similar to a C-54) all lined up and I had no idea what they were pointing at. There was no noise at all, and after a while I noticed they began slowly moving toward the southeast, about five miles, then I lost them in the sky. I estimate the cloud containing the lights was about a half-mile wide, the lights never moved in relation to one another, until the entire \"thing\" (cloud and lights) slowly moved to the southeast and disappeared. I estimate their altitude to be 1000 to 2000 feet, but it is really hard to estimate altitude with no reference points and no idea how big the \"thing\" was. FYI: I used to be a MUFON invetigator (1980), however this is the first time I have ever seen anything in the sky resembling a UFO."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-08312009-0019","Longitude":"-75.156769","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"08/31/2009 09:35 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Country":"United States"}
