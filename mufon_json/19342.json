It was odd because it wasn't a windy day and other clouds in the vicinity were much bigger and stationary. Then I noticed a metallic sphere appear in the middle of the cloud pulsating with bright white light. It wasn���t moving, just hovering there, silently. It looked like it was changing shape but the flashes were so bright that it was hard to see the exact form. Seconds later it was gone and the small cloud surrounding it also disappeared. The object disappeared so suddenly as if a switch turned off and it became invisible instantly. A few minutes later as I���m running along my route a saw an object again in another location, this time without the bright flashes and the strange cloud. It was a round metallic orb. I was trying to find a better vintage point to see it unobstructed by trees but it was gone by the time I could get a better view. The location of the sighting is around St. George Street and Bernard Ave. in Toronto, Canada."],"Date Submitted":"09/16/2009 11:26 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ontario","Tags":"City","City":"Toronto","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19342.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19342.html"],"Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.658926,+-79.381994(19342)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19342) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/16/2009 09:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
