I see planes and things every night,I know what they look like. Anyway,the one on the right fades away first,but what the camera doesn't pick up,is that it fades to an orange,and moves off to the right. The other one stays for about a minute,fades to orange and then sort of goes up a little bit before vanashing. I do live near an airport,but these were like no planes i've seen before,firstly,the lights were massive compared to an aircraft light. Like huge stars. Anyway,enjoy!!"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"06/08/2008 10:25 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"51.75779","Case Number":"11216","Region":"England","Summary":"2 orbs of light,1 goes orange and moves to the left,the other dissapears.","City":"St Albans","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/08/2008 10:25 UTC","Country":"United Kingdom","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.75779,+-0.328812(11216)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11216) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11216.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11216.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
