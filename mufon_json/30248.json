Not very unusual but becoming less frequent as he gets older. I waited a few minutes to see if he'd simply go back to sleep on his own but he continued to call out my name calmly. Before going in his room I went out to living room of our apartment to fold out the futon couch for us to rest on. I set up a few pillows and blankets but before going back to his room I decided to open the sliding glass door a bit to let the cool night air in. While I was doing this I also decided to look up at the night sky. I was facing due East when I noticed just above the next apartment roof-line a normal sized looking star. It was stationary and I made the guess that it was a star or an airplane heading toward my direction (westward). After 5-10 seconds of a stationary position it slowly started to move straight up. I then ruled out it being a star and settled on it being a plane. It moved up approximately 5-10 degrees then completely stopped. Remained stationary for approximately 3-5 seconds then descended back down toward the horizon but NOT in a straight line. It was wiggling down or following a curving \"S\" shape path down until it was out of view because of the facing apartment building roof top. The color of the light appeared to be a dull red. Additionally, later that morning when I was walking out the door I kissed my wife goodbye and my son. He looked up at me and said, ���Orion see big spaceship in the sky. Big spaceship in sky���. Our jaws dropped. The last time he woke up in the middle of the night (approx late June), and coincidentally it was the same time 3:45 am. The next morning he said the same thing to my wife Careen, ���Orion see spaceship high in the sky���. In my report here, I���m paraphrasing but Careen wrote down what he said that morning for a more precise reference to his own words."],"Date Submitted":"07/18/2011 04:04 UTC","Log Number":"US-07182011-0013","Country":"United States"}
