This orb pulsated, orange, moved at the appearent speed of a helicopter, no sound and under the cloud cover in a straigh flight path until it appeared to accelerate and ascend through the clouds shrinking into a small white ball, too fast and straight to be a balloon or lantern. Note, this was under the clouds, so it wasn't a planet, space station or satelite. This was the best of 5 sightings I've had in the last month over Lee's Summit, MO (suburb of Kansas City). I've never seen them before. My wife, a devot Catholic, and non believer in UFO's or Aliens witnessed one with me on 4th of July and is freaking out. I'm an engineer, trained to think logically, and I can't explain these sitings. It's very disturbing."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.924563,+-94.378216(40617)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40617) map </A>","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Latitude":"38.924563","Longitude":"-94.378216","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Orange orb under cloud cover moving due north.
