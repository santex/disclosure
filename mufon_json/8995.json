we thought we were really going to die!! but we managed to what we now joking call \"two blondes out manouvering a ufo!\" but it was not at all funny! it was terrifying!! the craft actually was hovering in the tree tops to the left of the rural road we were traveling on to go to her house. we stopped the car!! it moved into position about 40 feet in front of us, about 40 feet above us, then lowered itself in the center of the road, a craft about 30 feet wide, sauser shaped, blue and red pulsating lights on the perimeter, flashing...and a wide as the road blue\\grey beam of light coming below it onto the road in front of us!! she wanted to turn around the car and go back towards town!!! all i knew was \"don't get under the blue beam of light!! i told her to go to the right into our upper driveway and get into the house!! we actually were at a \"standoff\" with this craft...waiting to see who would make the next move...then we actually had to go toward the craft to get to the upper driveway!!! oh, my god!! we were terrified!!!! but we did it, and swerved to the right just as the thing was coming toward us, we at it!! we knew the thing was over our heads, my sister got out the driver's side door...running towards the house. i got out the passenger side, was going around the back of the vehicle, when she says \"and it's not a helicopter...it makes no noise!!' with that i lifted my head just level...and there it was hovering about 10 feet off the ground between the garage and our house!!! and it made a little whisper of sort of an \"electrical\" sound. very, very, very faint for a 30 foot craft. there was just a blue\\grey sort of misty light around it at this time. then it hovered, then very, very, very slowly lifted up and hovered over the treetops just about 50 feet from me. then slowly took off toward the road again. we ran into the house terrified!! we would not go out after dark for the three months i stayed there after that. i came back to missouri the end of september, only to find \"they are here also!!\" anyway, since coming back to missouri i have been watching these blue\\green and red pulsating \"stars\" constantly \"hovering\" low in the sky....almost any given night!!! and the \"bright white stars\" there also!! i have told others about them, but they don't seem to see them. i see them all the time! well, this morning at about 6:30 am i was getting up for work, and looked outside. there was one \"hovering\" low in the sky. the only \"star\" out in the sky this morning!!! nothing else!! i went to get dressed, looked out the window again and said to myself upon seeing the \"bright white star\" in the sky, just hovering low again....\"angel transport.\" (i told someone about these objects in the sky, and he told me, like he really knew, \"they are angel transports.\") as soon as i said that....i noticed the object was disappearing from my view....vertically!! it was moving out of my sight from the window, slowly, slowly upwards!! i ran outside...and it was moving, silently, slowly, slowly straight up!! and there were no other lights on the object...only a bright, brilliant white light, slowly to me moving straight up!! then it, without any sort of position change, started moving to the east, until it went over my building and getting very small and out of sight. i came upstairs to the highway level of the building....and there it is!! big and bright and very low, hovering again right close up there in the sky again!! i came in to email a friend about it, excited!! i had never seen one move around like this!!! now it's about 7:15 am and it is just staying there, but then a few minutes later it has moved east far away. and now it is gone!! that was absolutely amazing!! i don't know what they are, who they are, but this one i waved \"goodbye\" to this morning! i don't know if these are connected, but they seem to be all over. not just here. and i don't know if other \"spiritual\" things happening in my life, as well as my sister's life, for the past twelve years are realated, but somehow i believe it may be so also. something is definately happening here. now talking to others here, many people tell me stories of \"strange sightings\" here too. time will tell. and sharing these experiences and sighting can only help to figure out exactly what is happening, and who and what these things are. i hope you will not only find this information \"interesting,\" but helpful in accomplishing this goal. i will \"keep watching!!\""],"Date Submitted":"01/18/2008 06:47 UTC"}
