One of my 4 year old twin girls was lying flat on the grass looking straight up at the sky when she suddenly blurted Daddy what is that? I looked up and at first didn���t see anything so I answered ���a cloud���. She then said no Daddy, look! I again looked up more carefully this time and saw a neon green boomerang shaped object flying East to West directly overhead. Its shape was identical to that of a boomerang, not a B2 bomber or a stealth fighter. Its color was almost luminescent mint green. The object continued on its path and remained visible for about 30 seconds. Then it just disappeared. I kept looking up trying to spot it again when I became aware of a second object which appeared much smaller and higher in the sky then the first. This second object followed the same flight pattern as the first but from a much higher altitude. The second object almost looked like a star because it was small and white and extremely bright. Then this second object disappeared just as quickly as the first. I am not sure what I witnessed because I have never seen anything like this before. Both objects were flying at speeds similar to conventional jet aircraft. Unlike conventional aircraft both objects simply disappeared from sight spontaneously. They did not veer off at an angle or accelerate at tremendous speed. One moment they were there and the next they were gone."],"Case Number":"13562","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Miami","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-11062008-0009","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Latitude":"25.795009","Summary":"I again looked up more carefully this time and saw a neon green boomerang shaped object flying East to West directly overhead.
