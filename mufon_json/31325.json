Perfect clime. Suddenly i saw (i though it was a star) something moving very slowly, but it was close because the clouds was more higher than that thing!! i was looking for another witness on the area, but i was the only one.... but i saw another thing on the north, like a cellphone with green, red and orange lights... and it was like 10 or 15 kilometers from where i was watching those things.. i stay 10 minutes if suddenly something happened next, but it just hovered the area..... and i had to go to my house...... i don���t know what are those objets.... but i can say that isn���t human!! i'm not exaggerating!!!!
