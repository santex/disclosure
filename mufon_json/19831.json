{"Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"19831","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs a thirteen year old kid,I was waiting at the edge of the woods(still to dark to enter the woods) with father and brother to squirrel hunt. It was a clear and cool morning. Looking up(had been an amateur astronomer for 3+ yrs)I saw a round object moving north to south in a straight line. It was quiet, and pulsated with obvious bright to dim light. It moved across the sky in approximately 15 seconds after first viewed. Due to a mountainess region, there was obviously limited area to view the object. My father and brother watched with amazement as well. It moved across the mountain tops out of site but within about 20 seconds a jet aircraft with engine(s)screaming came out of the west and traveled in an arc like trajectory veering to the south. It was obvious that it was chasing the ufo. No other reports were noted regarding the siting. My father just turned 90 yrs of age and still remembers the incident."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.973711,+-82.01735(19831)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19831) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10062009-0005","Date Submitted":"10/06/2009 08:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"10/09/1965 07:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"37.973711","Tags":"City","City":"Chapmanville","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19831.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19831.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Region":"West Virginia","Country":"United States","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Chapmanville","There were no other sightings in Chapmanville on or around October 9th 1965"],"Longitude":"-82.01735","Summary":"Round in shape, pulsating bright to dim, noiseless.","Weather Factors":"None"}
