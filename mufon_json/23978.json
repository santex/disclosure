{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was stepping out of my car and saw a large commercial aircraft very low on approach to Gallatin Field when suddenly I saw what i initially thought was an eagle swoop around and speed up straight towards the plane. My 1st thought was this huge eagle was about to hit the plane when suddenly it did a zig zag like manuver to miss the plane, it then slowed and continued to fly past the plane heading east. I tracked it for as long as i could which was about a minute until it was to far away to see. I know for sure that what ever it was had to be seen by the pilots! the plane even jerked a bit as if it had hit turbulence or the pilot had jerked in surprise. it was clear blue sky and calm conditions. within 2 hours of this 2 very large military helicopters dual blade troop carriers were flying around the same general area. as a side note, I am hoping by filing this report more people will come forward, it was right above a large area of construction on interstate 90 and above Wal-Mart during a busy time of day!"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","City":"Bozeman","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23978.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23978.html"],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Bozeman","There were no other sightings in Bozeman on or around June 26th 2010"],"Longitude":"-111.041299","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.68798,+-111.041299(23978)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23978) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"45.68798","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"23978","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/27/2010 12:58 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/26/2010 02:25 UTC","Summary":"Dark orb/sphere metallic shine from sun.","Log Number":"US-06272010-0001","Region":"Montana"}
