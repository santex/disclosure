I think I may have a very good theary about ufo's propulsion systems. I have an associates degree in alternate fuels and fuel systems and during the course of some research that I was doing I stumbled onto some information that may explain why ufo's have to visit earth to get some of their fuel.Please feel free to give me a call at my # listed above. thank you."]}
