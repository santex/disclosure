Pine junction, looking at the sky in the direction of the local airport, when I saw an unusually bright red light moving to the left of my view at a fairly slow speed. Shortly after I spotted the light, it began flashing a high intensity strobe light which was white in a random pattern which was very rapid sometimes (4-5 flashes per second) and slower at other times (2-3 seconds between each flash). At first I thought that I must be seeing some type of helicopter because of the slow speed and low altitude, and the white strobes must be the flash from a camera. But a helicopter would more than likely have more than just one red light right? And why would anyone be using a flash on a camera while in the air at night? I would think the light wouldn't be reflected enough unless you were rather close to the subject you were taking a picture of? Anyway, the whole thing only lasted about 45 seconds and then it was being blocked by trees and I lost sight of it."],"Date of the Event":"11/23/2008 07:15 UTC","Latitude":"34.5037","Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"15090"}
