{"Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn the summer of 2008 I was finishing an evening walk and noticed a strange orange light in the night sky. When I got home, I grabbed my video camera and started recording. Watch the video and notice the different colors from this object. Also watch around the 35 sec mark where another \"object\" appears and quickly disappears. I didn't have a tripod, so there is some camera movement. The video is slowed down but otherwise unaltered and is only a small part of the total recording. The jpg contains captures from the video. This object moved slowing in different directions before fading away."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Novi","There were no other sightings in Novi on or around June 20th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-03162009-0008","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"16050","Summary":"Video of orange star-like object.","Date of the Event":"06/20/2008 10:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/20/2008 10:45 UTC","Region":"Michigan","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16050.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16050_submitter_file2__ufomerge.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16050.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.4877,+-83.467631(16050)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16050) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.467631","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Latitude":"42.4877","City":"Novi"}
