I saw the object and watched it thinking it looked kind of strange but figured it was probably just a strange angle on a helicopter or an airplane. It was far enough away that I wouldn't have been able to hear anything as we were also near a freeway. I then watched it literally drop out of the sky leave a white vapor trail and a small cloud that once we parked i could no longer see."]}
