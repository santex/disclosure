I noticed a very large white orb with a faint orange tint. Appearing larger then the sun at the time ,south east in the sky. I first thought nothing of it, still finding it odd that its larger then the sun, though not giving off much brightness of light, nor moving. I felt calm & at peace watching the object as a friend drove that morning. I brought the topic up but no one in the car wanted to hear it. So i just watched if for a good 20+ min's. It didn't move, just sat with a non'bright glow' of white light about it, appearing larger then the sun. I looked away for a single moment at something on the road, look'd back and it was gone. Simple as that."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47062.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47062.html"],"Latitude":"38.899122","Date of the Event":"06/12/2012 06:45 UTC","Summary":"Large low Altitude white glowing orb'.
