Next thing I knew there was a huge beam of light that flashed over my head. The sound that projected from this star was none other ive experienced on earth. My brain felt like it was being chopped from my skull and for the next two hours i felt my head would lside from my brain. This is powerful alien technology that humans do not have access to here on earth. I also have had numerous alien encounters and not sure whom to speak to about any of this. I would even be willing to take a lie detector in order to confirm what I have seen. I am know to have a picture perfect memory ande alos have information that is pertinent to the survival of our race. Any correspondence regarding these issues is highly appreciated."]}
