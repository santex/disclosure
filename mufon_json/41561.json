Light was performing a zig-zag pattern. At first it look like one of many stars, but it was moving. It was a pinpoint of light high in the night sky going first one way, then another, then another and so on in a zig-zag pattern. I felt it was an unusual way for a light in the night sky to move. Doing a zig-zag pattern in the sky would involve sharp angle turns that normal aircraft could not do. It seemed to get more distant and lost sight of it. Plus I was busy talking to other campers about other things."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.076115,+-121.518072(41561)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41561) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
