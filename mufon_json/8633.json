At firt i thought it was a plane until i looked more closely. you cluld see the outline of the object as it swayed back and forth. It was much longer than a plane and it moved from side to side. After about 35 minutes of watching it move several hundred yards side to side it dipped behind the hillside. This object was under 2 miles away from me so if it was a plane or a helicopter i would have definatley heard it."],"Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"42.442257","Case Number":"8633","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-123.322492","Object Shape":"Chevron","Date of the Event":"12/17/2007 10:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"chevron shaped object hovered slowly back and forth over my property for over a half an hour","Weather Factors":"Windy","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
