Wife saw it first and said look east in sky. There was this reddish object flying right over our driveway. It was soundless and pulsated some or blinked slightly. It covered distznce from treeline to treeline in approx 5 to 10 seconds; would guess about 6 0r 7. It did not have any navigational or blinking lights. Looked like a hot air bzloon elongated. We live on east side of city in Georgetown area and feel others must have seen it also as it was about 8;45 PM on a clear but dark Saturday night. Any other Fort Wayne reports collborating this sighting?? Thank you. PS Tried to also contact \"UFOCasebook.com\" which I check every so often but was unable to get their \"contact us\" link to cooperate."],"City":"Fort Wayne","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"09/18/2011 09:37 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/17/2011 08:45 UTC","Case Number":"31894","Source":"MUFON"}
