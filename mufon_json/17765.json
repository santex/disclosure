[white, blue, white, blue and so on]. not like any aircraft i have seen.it was hovering 3-4 feet over a field. then it took off past me right as i was driving by. there were a few people pulled over behind me so im sure they were watching it too."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17765.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17765.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.612109,+-116.391513(17765)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17765) map </A>","City":"Meridian","Summary":"It was flying really fast, with really bright lights.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/30/2009 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Meridian","There were no other sightings in Meridian on or around June 30th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.612109","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"17765","Date of the Event":"06/30/2009 12:00 UTC"}
