I am driving north towards Carbondale where I live. A car driving south starts flashing it's lights at me fast. I figure it's a warning for deer. I don't see any deer then I glance to the left and a glowing green ball is moving at a high rate of speed traveling north, almost like a flash. I was amazed and thought I just witnessed a comet, then on the right side of 51 a huge low flying triangle object with about at least 4-5 dim lights is traveling northwest towards cedar lake. I fumble for my cell phone and got a video but it shows nothing really.The triangle moved steady at a pretty good rate but not extremely fast. I turned down rifle range and could barely see it through the trees heading towards cedar lake. I drove to the boat ramp and saw nothing. After an hour of debating I reported it hoping to hear of similar sightings. That is why I'm posting this. I cannot reveal my identity because people will think I'm a freak! I know someone else had to have seen it especially the car that was frantically flashing their lights. This is the first time I've seen anything like this. So anyone that saw the flying triangle about 100 yards wide please post your story. I'm still in disbelief."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Triangle","Longitude":"-89.208972","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Makanda","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Illinois","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/30/2009 11:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-12012009-0004","Date Submitted":"12/01/2009 02:50 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20823.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20823.html"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"20823","City":"Makanda"}
