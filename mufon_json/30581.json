I thought to myself \"that's not a UFO\" then as i passed by some trees that were obstructing my view from the right I saw six more orbs hovering. I immediately pulled off to the side of the road and got out of my car. I took 3 pictures with my phone as they were slowly crawling across the night sky. two other drivers pulled over as well to view the crafts. the further away the got they seemed to move faster until they disappeared in the distance. needless to say my heart was pounding pretty hard. about 10 minutes later after i arrived at my destination i saw a helicopter circling the interstate, also police everywhere."],"trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Sarasota","There were no other sightings in Sarasota on or around August 2nd 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"27.342215","Case Number":"30581"}
