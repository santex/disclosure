{"Date of the Event":"10/01/2013 12:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside at the park playing with my grandpa and sister. I first noticed the object when it started to get very bright outside and my phone started to buzz when I was having no calls or nothing. At first i thought it was a weather balloon before all those weird and strange things started to happen.The object looked like a weather balloon on steroids. It moved mostly forward and hovered. I was in complete shock and surprise. I tried to take a picture but it was moving to fast. I lost sight of the object when it zipped on past the horizon."],"Region":"Missouri","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"38.818918","City":"O'Fallon","Date Submitted":"11/10/2013 10:49 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in O'Fallon","There were no other sightings in O'Fallon on or around October 1st 2013"],"Summary":"It flew faster than any airplane or helicopter i have ever seen","Case Number":"52156","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11102013-0008","Object Shape":"Blimp, Disc, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.818918,+-90.697048(52156)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52156) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:01:18","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52156.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52156.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-90.697048"}
