I noticed a strange silouhette-like triangle shape out of my peripheral. I started tracking it with my eyes and noticed there were three dim gray lights in an equilateral triangle formation. I could not tell if they were connected or separate, but I felt as though it was one craft I was looking at, not three. If you held a nickel up at arms length it was about as large as the nickel from point to point. The lights moved at a constant rate the whole time, very fast, in a straight line. I watched it move silently for about 15 seconds until it was behind the optometry building. I felt both wonderment and fear while I stood there watching it. This is the second time I have seen a trio of lights in the sky. It was way too strange."],"Summary":"Dim gray lights in equilateral triangle formation moved in a straight line."}
