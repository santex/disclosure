It was moving slow in one direction then stopped and started moving in another direction then disappeared. We were looking at the stars because it was a clear night and noticed it was very bright compared to the stars. Thought it might have been a helicopter but up to high to be one and it was slowing down and then going faster it did that at least two times and then it turned west and going up at the same time then completely vanished !!"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-120.552901","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.813293,+-120.552901(47213)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47213) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/05/2013 10:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.813293","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47213.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47213.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Seen glowing light in sky slowly moving then stop and go in another direction.","Log Number":"US-05062013-0007","Date Submitted":"05/06/2013 04:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":[]}
