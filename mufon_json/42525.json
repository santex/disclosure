Two cars were ahead of me, and neither slowed down but I saw it just hovering in a pasture. I stopped my car and got out, and it started moving away with a swooshing noise. It was disc shaped, with multi colored lights circling it. I was not frightened at all as I know that there are many entities watching over us and are getting ready for us to ascend."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Michigan","Latitude":"42.494606","Date of the Event":"09/11/2012 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/13/2012 06:47 UTC","Log Number":"US-09132012-0007","Longitude":"-85.529036","City":"Pine Lake","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.494606,+-85.529036(42525)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42525) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pine Lake","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
