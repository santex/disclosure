(which we were all wearing) then, the object suddenly accelerated north at great speed. we all jumped back into the car and raced north to see how far it would go. we lost sight of it almost immediately . 10 miles ahead, we saw a group of people standing in the road, and we stopped to see what was going on. the people there had been observing this same craft for over an hour, and had stationed a watcher 15 miles back at m-59, who had a walkie-talkie; where they were communicating with each other on the location of the craft. according to the group, the craft had been moving at high rates of speed. the man at m-59 would report to the man stationed 15 miles north when he saw the craft zoom north again; the man 15 miles north reported that several times the craft had made the 15 mile trip in 6.5 seconds. we stood and watched this craft with the local police for over an hour, until it suddenly stopped, then zoomed straight up, and was gone. by the time it departed, there were approx 50 people standing there."],"Longitude":"-84.080161","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"09/12/1993 01:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32907.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32907.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Enormous silver disc flying at impossible speeds above tree line.","Case Number":"32907","Object Features":"None","City":"Argentine/Lyndon","Latitude":"42.378767","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
