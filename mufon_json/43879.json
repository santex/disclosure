{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in the living room when my mom pointed out lights in the distance out the window. We went outside and viewed orangish, goldish lights accending. We immediately thought they were helicopters, but helicopters dont have a bright orange light on them. At one time there were as many as six lights. They accended, decsended, hovered, changed directions, split up, regrouped, and before the lights dissapeared they began to get dim, bright, dim, bright. We were very confused as we have never seen any thing of this type before. All the lights eventually dissapeared after about ten minutes."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Several orange colored lights accended, decended, hovered and changed direction.
