Suddenly my husband yelled for me to look up and pointed out something very odd, we saw a large orange-reddish colored 'orb' moving from south to north, below the clouds but above the mountain range. It was moving in very quick, but steady fashion. It was definatley not an airplane, falling star or a firework, impossible. We ran down the street so we could continue to view it, after just a few minutes it disappeared into the distance."],"Date of the Event":"07/03/2011 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.618421","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.618421,+-105.00834(30008)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30008) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-07062011-0003","Summary":"We saw an orange-reddish colored object going north","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30008.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30008.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Littleton","There was one other sighting in Littleton on or around July 3rd 2011"],"Longitude":"-105.00834","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"30008"}
