{"divs":["sighting detailson 8\\14\\11 i was in my backyard in ne seattle (lake city) at 9:10 pm pdt when i noticed a large very bright steady red light at about 30-40 degrees elevation to the east, moving slowly south. just before it moved behind some trees it changed direction slightly toward the southeast. i walked to the street to try to see it again and saw a similarly sized bright white light now traveling north at the same elevation. it moved north for about 20 seconds, the veered to the ne and slowly got dimmer until i couldn't see it. it's apparent speed was about 1\\2 degree (width of full moon) per second, but it might have sped up after it turned to the ne and moved away from me. no blinking lights, no sound that i could hear. i couldn't make out a shape. its apparent size was at least 4 times larger than the iss, like a small aspirin held at arms length. it was partly cloudy with the full moon below it in the east, but i didn't notice if the light was in front of the clouds or in clear sky."],"trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There were no other sightings in Seattle on or around August 14th 2011"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"08/15/2011 12:29 UTC","Longitude":"-122.26812","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"30914","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"08/14/2011 09:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08152011-0010","City":"Seattle","Region":"Washington","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30914.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30914.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.729815,+-122.26812(30914)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30914) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"BRIGHT Red-orange light moving south, then white moving north","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"47.729815"}
