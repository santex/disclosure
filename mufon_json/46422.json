Due to the extended nature of this event it is difficult to surmise in one short paragraph. I am writing this because of the recent airing of the bucks county pa sightings. During my sighting I have also Witnessed the same strange twinkling lights descending throughout the trees. This is why I am writing this letter now. I am willing to elaborate more on this and I will also be willing to submit to any testing that would need to be performed to prove my honesty. Many people in my town know of this and I've already been made the fool because of a life changing event that many people don't understand.
