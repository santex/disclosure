I looked up in the sky. It wasn't a perfectly clear blue sky , there were thin layers of a few clouds. I saw some sort of star-like object in the sky about north west of us maybe somewhere in Northern LA. Since i was in a car, i couldn't tell if it was moving or not , but i knew it wasn't a star. It seemed to be like a really bright light but very far off . Not anywhere near us but it couldn't be an airplane or helicopter . I saw this once before when i was driving on the same road and about the same strip of highway except the object was in a different area of the sky. This time , my father saw it too and he thought it might be a star also but he too is a strong believer in outside life . I watched it for a few seconds before it disappeared behind some clouds . I kept my eyes open looking to see it would appear anywhere else but it didn't . I didn't get a really good look at it , but i know that it was really strange considering i saw this beofore a few months back in the same place . I'm not exactly sure what it was , but I'm leaning towards it being a UFO . and since that only means Unidentified flying object, then it had to have been . Maybe it was just the reflection of light that caused this weird encounter. I'm not sure , I'm just here to report it .
