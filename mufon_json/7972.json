It moved in a SW to NE direction. The anamoly did not move in a straight, direct path, it instead appeared to move in slight serpentine motion. From the observation point the object covered the distance of horizon to horizon in approximately 20 seconds total, although we only noticed it when it was almost directly above us. When first observed the anamoly was a noticeably bright white object. The rate of speed the anamoly was moving made it immediately stand out. It then faded from view near the NE horizon.
