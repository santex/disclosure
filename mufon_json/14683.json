It was at about 2000' AGL travelling at about 300 mph. It was completely silent and travelling level just below the clouds. Many people saw it, including several completely sober individuals as well as some young children. After about 30-40 seconds it disappeared into the clouds. My first thought was that it was a meteor, but it was travelling level at 2000', not decending, and much too slow to be a meteor. It was completely silent and had NO flashing aircraft-type lights on it at all. We all, including myself just watched it disappear into the clouds. I thought to myself, cool first contact!"],"Longitude":"-111.044479","Date Submitted":"01/01/2009 12:10 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Region":"Montana","Log Number":"US-01012009-0028","Source":"MUFON","City":"Bozeman","Case Number":"14683","Latitude":"45.68876","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Bozeman","There were no other sightings in Bozeman on or around January 1st 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
