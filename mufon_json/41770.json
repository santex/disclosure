It was very bright and much brighter than a normal star in the sky. It was also low on the horizon. I lost view and when I got to a point where I could see it again it was gone. This was the same thing that the news reported about a while back I think. I have seen it before but I didnt see it disappear. No doubt it was there and then it was gone."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"41770","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08152012-0011","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Blue Springs","There were no other sightings in Blue Springs on or around August 14th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41770.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41770.html"],"Summary":"Blue Springs Mo UFO spotted again then disappears","Latitude":"39.022031","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/15/2012 10:03 UTC","Region":"Missouri","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/14/2012 10:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
