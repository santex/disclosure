My car is facing south to Fairmont. We are located at a home stead on OCR in Morgantown WV. The weather was poor. Cloud cover and cloud to cloud lighting. There are several small plans that fly over head but most of them are small craft and I estimate that they are at 1500 ft or below. The Planes are clearly visable with wing and tail lights. While talking to my friend for a while outside, I notice a glowing object being refelected in my rear windsheild moving to the south. At first I thought it might have been a satellite. I looked over head to the south where the object cast a black dot with a red sphere surounded by another sphere in a pale blue. The object stoped at about 35d angle from my vantage point in the sky. The object then started retracting its flight and headed north to downtown morgantown at a high rate of speed. Then it started moving in an arc to the east. It seemed to follow the cuvuture of the earth. It dispered over a mountain. While it was starting into the arc a small plane was flying west and seemed to catch the object while it was moving. The plane (to me) looked to stop (tree cover blocked full view of the plane) . A Few moments later the plane cleared the trees and looked to be rocking back and forth from the wings. Dan and I did not hear any prop or jet engine. The object did not make any noise. Neither of us felt threatend or scared. More Amazed. The light it produced is what make me feel like this is a real case. The light feathered (softented) from a red sphere surounding a black center ball to a blue sphere of light. It was amazing to see it. I wanted to send this into MUFON while it is still very fresh on my mind and the detail are still there.
