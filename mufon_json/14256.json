Again approximately (9:45pm easter time) 1 object with bright white lights flying over a farm field not far from original sighting.","divs":["sighting details12\\5\\08 approximately 7:05pm eastern time: my family was leaving for a night out when we noticed 3 very bright white lights in the near distance outside our front door of our home. i took some pictures (enclosed) with a digital camera but the zoom didn't do a very good job so the pictures look farther away then we actually seen with our naked eyes. we stood there and watched in amazement and wonder what exactly they were. all three object were hovering in a fixed spot and then one object would glide what seemed to be in a slow motion toward one of the others and stop and then distanced itself further and had colorful blinking lights and what sounded like a quite (helicopter propeller) like sound, but quieter. because of the time and our prior commitment, we had to leave but we had plenty to talk about and thought maybe it was military related since a naval air base is located 10 to 15 miles south in horsham, pa. 12\\5\\08 approximately 9:45pm eastern time: my family was returning home and seen just one object with the same exact description (bright white lights) and what looked to be a circular shape but was hard to make out because the lights were so bright and very close to the objects underbelly (which made the object look blurred to the naked eye) even my family members said they couldn't make it out for the same reasons, the bright lights were just so bright which made it look blurry. it was flying close to the ground over farm fields off of stump & haring roads in plumstead and after trying to follow it for a minute or two with our vehicle, it was gone into the crystal clear, star-lit sky. pretty cool.... whatever it was...."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","Latitude":"40.371771","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Dublin","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14256.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14256_submitter_file1__DSCF1066-b.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14256_submitter_file2__DSCF1067-b.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14256_submitter_file3__DSCF1068-b.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14256.html"],"Case Number":"14256","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.371771,+-75.201563(14256)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14256) map </A>","Longitude":"-75.201563","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/05/2008 07:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12062008-0006","City":"Dublin"}
