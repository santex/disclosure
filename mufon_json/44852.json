I thaut it cant be an airplane becouse i could not hear it, and they have no blue light. I got home to see if its anything there on the flight radar, but nothing. It blinked blue,sometimes it came closer or lower down, i dont know but the light got stronger. it moved verry slow, and i could observ it for around 2 hours. I even met a policeman, and he could not explain what that was ether. So i started to make photos and filmed it. When the object came closer or lower down, i was really scared. I lost the sight of the object becouse it was werry cold and i needed to get inside. I have more pictures and videos on the last picture (20121229_222128) u can also see the moon"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"18.419419"}
