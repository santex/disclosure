{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving to work and noticed a bright light almost like a star in the eastern sky. It was clear out with no clouds. The light started leaving a cloud like trail, at first I wondered if it was a plane but it had no blinking lights and was very bright. Then the trail stopped but the light remained. Then it moved through the sky and began to leave sideways zig-zag trail. After that it dissipated."],"Summary":"Bright yellow - white light going across the sky. Left a small trail and then stopped.
