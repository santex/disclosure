They moved steadily, in a loose formation, traveling from north to south, first there were 4 or 5 - then they just disappeared and more appeared; then they, too, disappeared. In all, my husband counted around 30 of them. I tried to take photos with my phone camera, but it didn't work. I ran in the house and got another camera, but by then there was only one orb left and it disappeared as I tried to focus. The event took place in around 4 minutes. We live in Mohave Valley, Ariz. in a tri-state area. They appeared to be following the Colorado River (which is 2 blocks west of us) and were possibly above the desert in Clark County, Nevada or Needles, Calif. I don't know what they were, but there was no sound, just the lights moving across the sky."]}
