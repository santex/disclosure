I thought and believed that it was not a falling star but an UFO. By it being late and where it believed it landed. Nightly, as I walked my dog, I observed every date where it could have landed. On a particular night, as I was walking the dog, I looked up and saw the flying saucer rising over the trees in the direction where I believed it had landed. As then flying saucer came over the trees, it was so close to me that I could touch it. There was a bubble on the flying saucer and we were able to look at one another, face to face for at least two minutes until they gradually vanished I the air. As time passed, I would return to the place where then ship landed. I would call out to the UFO and they amazingly responded as star lights bounding off the trees. You have to be very careful because they have resources where they can seriously do bodily harm"],"Region":"Maryland","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.055165,+-76.634511(48010)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48010) map </A>","Longitude":"-76.634511","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/07/2009 10:09 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48010.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48010.html"],"Case Number":"48010","trends":[]}
