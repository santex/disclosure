My daughter was waiting to put the movie in the machine we were waiting on her. I looked out our window in the car and seen three glowing red lights that formed the shape of a chevron, slowly moving form the southeast to the northwest. As it approached a position about over the shopping center the lights began to disappear one by one. There were several people besides us that seen this that were standing in the parking area at Walgreens. I don't know what these lights were but this is not the first encounter we have had in this area. Makes you kind of wonder \"what going on in Greensboro."]}
