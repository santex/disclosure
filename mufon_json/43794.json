I was talking to a co-worker & I was facing east, he was facing west. This bright light caught my attention, I looked up to see a cigar shaped solid bright light there in the sky. Just I was getting ready to tell my co-worker to turn around, it took off in a North direction & disappeared. It all happened in a matter of seconds. My co-worker asked me what was wrong, cause I had a weird look on my face. I asked him to look up at the sky & tell me if there were any clouds or smoke from the factory. He said, NO. I was astonished as to what I had just witnessed & it couldn't have been any type of aircraft or search light."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/08/2012 08:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Date Submitted":"11/09/2012 12:21 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO appeared, Streaked across sky & disappeared in matter of seconds","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43794.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43794.html"],"Longitude":"-88.91031","Region":"Illinois","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Decatur","There were no other sightings in Decatur on or around November 8th 2012"],"City":"Decatur","Log Number":"US-11092012-0009"}
