Not one single sighting butseveral over a 3 year period. No moon during sightings. No electrical service inthe area, so no light interference. At the time I spent almost every eveningoutside enjoying the stars and the quiet. From within the mountains I observed ahelicopter, sometimes 2 that followed this object closely. It was completelydark with no lights. A strange sound. I am familiar with aircraft and turbineengines. This was very quiet and had a strange sound. I assumed that it was anew experimental aircraft from a facility within the San Tans. Sometimes thesecraft headed to Sacaton. There is a very strange facility near Sacatonsurrounded by orchards on the Reservation. It appeared that these aircraftheaded toward Sacaton. After finding this facility I became intriqued.This is avery odd facility. I can show anyone the location if anyone interested. I am notclaiming that it is alien, but the facility and these sightings are interestingand may worthwhile."],"Longitude":"-111.739299","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.076722","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"Craft at night w/ helicopter escort.
