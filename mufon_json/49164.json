the object then decided to move again. it traveled in front of the house, began moving up a little higher and to the west then outta nowhere, it disappeared right in front of my eyes. i did notice that when it disappeared, it was almost as if it shrunk and at that exact moment,for a split second, i saw a small white\\silver light as it disappeared. again, i was completely baffled. i ran in the house and ran to the back deck to see if maybe my neighbors were burning things but they were not. i came back in and tried to show my sister the video and it was gone..poof...like i never recorded anything!! my sister then said the cable had just gone out too and the tv had to be reset. so weird. i also ruled out my initial thought that maybe it was a chinese lantern because one, it did not look like a lantern at all nor was it shaped as such and two, it traveled in a distinct like directional pattern, horizontially, stopped and hovered above me, and did not even travel up higher into the sky until it disappeared. 30 minutes or so later my sister was on back deck and screamed out because she saw a very very large bright white light streak through a clearing in our backyard trees. she said it was not actually in the woods but behind them and very very big and fast. it shot from southwest to southeast. the next day my neice before even hearing of the white light my sister saw, she said at that same exact time, while she was on her way to her boyfriends in robertsville, mo a huge white light seemed to shoot towards her vehicle and then up. she said it happened so fast and she had no idea what it was but it was not above the horizon. almost as if it was right on front of her but maybe it was just tht large and bright. so, i found it very odd all of this happened within a 30 to 40 minute span. i have since searched the area where the fireball object disappeared and was unable to find any trace of it. nothing. i also went as far as to check how much wind we had at that exact time and our winds were at 0. was a very very calm night. nothing since then though. i am very upset the video was not found on my phone not to mention confused as to what happened to it. i have never seen anything like i saw that night. for some reason though, as close as it was to me, and even stopping right in front of me, i did not feel any fear."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49164.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49164.html"],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"07/24/2013 10:09 UTC","Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON","City":"Villa Ridge","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-90.889465","Date of the Event":"05/07/2013 09:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"38.46435","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"49164","Log Number":"US-07242013-0022","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright red/orange/black fireball","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Villa Ridge","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
