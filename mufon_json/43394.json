Nearly to the end of westerfeild rd on my right direct above the field i saw a static bright white light i would say under the cloud, Cars were coming towards me so i was going slow the light was still then shot towards me lit the car up orange and my granddaughter was excited with brights lights. It seem to stop and then shot back to near to where it started but further to the left and went back to bright white. The car in front of me pulled over into the passing place and i pulled behind him i saw he got his mobile out and pointing at the light, I also started to click away on my mobile phone and got serveral photos, within what seemed like only seconds repeated the same movements again and again turned red with a ornge glow around it. I cant remember any noise but my grandaughter was chatting away asking what it was. Again it shot back and up , i did try and keep an eye on it but had to start driving again and managed to keep glancing up through the trees into the sky and i took a right turn onto a larger road. I lost sight of it as i made a left turn into humberducy lane. I have never seen anything like it and i could not describe the shape and it glowed with like a solid mass in the middle, It was large. What i think frightend me most was that it changed colour and then went back and then changed again, i know thats not normal! My heart was racing a little as my husband always look in the sky and he is intrested in UFO;s however it frightened me a little and i had my granddaughter with me.I also think i was a little excited to think i had seen something that may have been a UFO to tell my husband. The other thing i remember is that i could kind of tell where it had been because it looked ligher if that make sense,"],"Tags":"City"}
