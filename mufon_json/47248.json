Its when the guy is on the table n a mist comes down and then a layer of some kinda membrane came down and covers him. you feel powerless. and i can remember this feeling if i concentrate hard enough, which i dont do 2 often. A few yearsa went by and i started remembering being around when all this happen in dreams or just remembering what had happened. 1 nite i woke in my own house n being scared n getting up n going 2 my parents room n climbing inbetween then n going back 2 sleep, then waking uo between them n being very scared. i started moving around alot when a i heard voice in my head say please stay calm n nobody will b hurt, istarted banging my fists on the bed 2 try n wake my parents but got no response from them, they had their backs 2 me, n i rembering thinking they should wake up with me hitting the bed like i was but they didnt, then i realized that my fists were hurting cause it wasnt a mattress i was hitting, it was hard, n once i started hitting harder i heard again a voice in my head that if i didnt calm down my parents would die. This is so far the worst of my memories. the feelings n memories still remain. The only other memory i can recalect is when i was in my 20's n me n a friend were leaving my parents house n walking across the street when i remember looking up n seeing a craft in the sky, it was square n boxy like, if u can understand that,after that i don remember much but these memories r still here n have gotten worse in the past few years, i now drink alot 2 try n not think about these events but they're always there. So far i've been ok with them but i'm feeling the need 2 know 4 sure that im not crazy!!!!!!
