She noticed that there were colorful lights flashing in the sky. At first, I thought it was a plane, but then it just shot off really fast. Then, we saw another one just staying in the same spot for a duration of about 30 minutes. It would occasionally just shot a couple of feet in different directions.It would flash colors of blue, green, pink, and red. I kept looking around and i noticed that six of them went all in the same direction within a five minute time period. A few minutes later, one caame really fast shotting right over us, then slowing down. I do belive that this sighting was a UFO."],"Latitude":"33.252381","Object Shape":"Disc, Flash, Star-like","Date Submitted":"10/22/2010 11:03 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26048.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26048.html"]}
