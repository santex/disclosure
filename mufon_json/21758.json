{"Longitude":"-91.990121","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02032010-0003","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn February 2, 2010, at approximately 8:05pm, I was driving south on Louisiana State Highway 89 at Glaser Drive, just south of LA Hwy 182 near Youngsville, Louisiana (70592), when I saw what at first appeared to be a radio tower beacon. Knowing that there are no towers in the area, I paid close attention to the object. This was when I realized that the object was moving, in a SSW direction. The object first appeared to be glowing, but after a closer look, it seemed to be aflame. It did not appear to be moving quickly, and I did not see it leaving a ���trail���. I thought that it was an emergency flare, but I think that a flare is more of a ���glow��� than a ���flame���, and this was definitely a flame. The object seemed to be about 60 degrees up from the horizon when I first spotted it, and directly ahead of me (90 degrees) when I lost sight of it (or at the point it ���flamed out���). I hope that I am using the right terminology here. It seemed to have lost some elevation as it moved away from me, but without knowing the altitude of the object, there is no way to know how much elevation was lost. The object either ���flamed out��� or moved behind clouds at approximately 8:09 pm. After arriving home, I called 911, but they had received no other reports of the object. I have attached a video that I took towards the end of the sighting. It is very faint, but look for a dim light toward the center of the screen"],"Case Number":"21758","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.099647,+-91.990121(21758)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21758) map </A>","Region":"Louisiana","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Youngsville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Summary":"\"Flaming\" object falling from sky at an angle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21758.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21758_submitter_file2__LargerUFOMap.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21758_submitter_file3__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21758.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/03/2010 10:41 UTC","Latitude":"30.099647","City":"Youngsville","Date of the Event":"02/02/2010 08:05 UTC"}
