As we looked up at the starts we noticed one of the stars moving across the sky at a very hight rate of speed. It looked like all the other stars, the same size and color except it was moving across the sky very fast, we watched it for about 2-3 minutes until it disappeared. It definately was not a shooting star. I was wondering if anyone else reported seeing it or if Julian has alot of sightings in general?"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wynola","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Longitude":"-116.645576","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/21/2009 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/21/2009 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-07222009-0009","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"33.097544","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.097544,+-116.645576(18233)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18233) map </A>"}
