They said that this long cylinder formation did not seem to be moving and after about 5 minuets or so slowly dissipated. From their description of the event it did not sound as if it was some kind of craft but I found the pictures so interesting that I wanted to find out if this is a naturally occurring event. So far I have not been able to find anything like it. Take a look at the pic and see for yourself."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.787774,+-77.382864(23330)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23330) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05172010-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23330.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23330_submitter_file1__StrangeCloud.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23330.html"],"City":"Clifton","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"23330","Country":"United States"}
