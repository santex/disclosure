The object was traveling from east to west at approximately 15 degrees southwest. I checked our paper the next day, but did not see any reference to the object. It was not until years later I learned about the Roswell incident that I thought about the incident seriously. During that time we lived in the country and watched what we called \"shooting stars\" almost nightly. This object was obviously not a shooting star. It was low enough so that if I had not been so awe struck, I probably could have heard the noise from the flames. The tail trailing the object was very long and sustained until it went out of site. I checked the location of Roswell NM in reference to Tyronza and I truly believe this was the object that crashed near Roswell, NM. I also do not believe the explanation given by the US Airforce."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3291.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3291.html"],"Case Number":"3291","Tags":"City","Log Number":"","Date of the Event":"02/20/2005 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
