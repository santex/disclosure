It was a clear, warm day. For whatever reason, I looked directly above me, and I saw a white object that looked similar to a lear jet. It was at least a mile above me, looking about four inches long. I nudged my girl and pointed to it. It moved forward, then backward, then sideways left, then sideways right, then up, then down, all in about 5 seconds. Then it hovered in place for a couple seconds, then took off at incredible speed, disappearing in one second max. I asked my girlfriend \"Did you see that?\". She said she saw it too."],"Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Other","Case Number":"22095","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22095.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22095.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/16/1980 02:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.966516,+-82.994864(22095)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22095) map </A>","Longitude":"-82.994864","Summary":"Saw object move like no aircraft can and at speeds which no aircraft can obtain.","Latitude":"39.966516","Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"US-03022010-0011","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Wings"}
