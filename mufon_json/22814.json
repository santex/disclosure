They moved E-NE, slowly, over my house, and I lost sight of them. As they came from behind the tree, one was behind the other, and then they shifted to side by side. I perceived them to be very low, and though it may have been traffic, there was a whisping type sound. At first I thought it was perhaps an advertising light, but there are no car lots for many miles (40 I think) and no clouds either. There is a military zone not too far from here, in the same direction."],"Longitude":"-120.001714","Latitude":"46.332642","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sunnyside","There were no other sightings in Sunnyside on or around April 13th 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, Unknown","Region":"Washington","Log Number":"US-04142010-0005"}
