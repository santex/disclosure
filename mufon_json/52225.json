Then i noticed that there wasn't any wings flapping or a break in the formation. then i thought, \"What the hell is that?\" i couldn't make out much detail of the object, the chevron shape i saw was the leading edge of the craft reflecting light. it was at about 3,000 ft altitude moving steadily from the north east, heading south west. i followed it by the way it blocked out the stars. the size was the most impressive. as i followed it it went directly over town, that's when i noticed that the back of the craft was rectangular. i knew then it wasn't ours. or anything i know of in our military's inventory.and the size was scary, something that big moving so quietly and fast. it flew over a baseball field here, i believe it couldn't have landed in the field it was so big. it took a moment or two to realize what i just saw. i felt a little scared, awed,confused, mostly excited. when i couldn't see that object or any other in the area, i went back inside and told my girlfriend what i just saw. i followed the object from first sight to where i had to lean around the front of the trailer to follow it. when it was over town that's when i noticed the rectangular shape and the width of it. i don't recall if i looked away, or if it just disappeared?? after i lost sight of it i looked at my cellphone and noted the time and date."],"Object Shape":"Chevron","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/13/2013 06:38 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/13/2013 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-149.489123","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"was out smoking a cigarette, star gazing. noticed movement out of the corner of my eye.","trends":[],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=64.203091,+-149.489123(52225)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52225) map </A>","Case Number":"52225","Region":"Alaska","Latitude":"64.203091","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11132013-0013"}
