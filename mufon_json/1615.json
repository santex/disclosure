As I was drivingwestbound on Rt. 28 in Kingston, I noticed a 3-light triangular formation thatappeared to have been either 3 separate aircraft or one with 3 lights. Thelatter would be more likely since they moved in total unison very slowly andsmoothly. It seemed to be very low at treetop level because as I went up anddown the hills, I lost sight of it. Although it was a very clear night, I couldnot see the body of the object(s) over or behind the lights. It moved in astraight eastbound direction. I thought about ultralights, but it was too coldfor that."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1615.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1615.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"04/06/2002 10:30 UTC","Latitude":"41.927037","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.927037,+-73.997361(1615)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1615) map </A>","Summary":"Saw a triangular formation of 3 lights","Country":"United States","Region":"New York","City":"Kingston","Log Number":"","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Kingston","There were no other sightings in Kingston on or around April 6th 2002"],"Case Number":"1615","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-73.997361"}
