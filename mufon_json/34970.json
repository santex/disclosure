{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI had just pulled into my driveway around 7:30pm and as I got out of my car I noticed 3 bright white lights in a straight line hovering just above the treetops across the farm field adjacent to my home. I watched them for a about 30 seconds and they began to move toward me as they appeared to rise. They flew silently over top of where I was standing and I noticed that they were in a triangular formation. They passed very slowly and quietly above me but when they were beyond my location I heard a sound which resembled a jet engine. I went inside and told my wife \"I think I just saw a UFO.\""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Vineland","Region":"New Jersey","Log Number":"US-01192012-0021","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.445471,+-75.01845(34970)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34970) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/19/2012 04:02 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/02/2012 07:30 UTC","Case Number":"34970","Longitude":"-75.01845","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34970.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34970.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.445471","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Vineland","There were no other sightings in Vineland on or around January 2nd 2012"],"Summary":"saw 3 bright white lights at treetop then flew over me in triangle formation."}
