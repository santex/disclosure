{"Date of the Event":"07/09/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing on my second floor balcony taking still pictures of an awesome storm rolling in when I first saw the object decend from between two massive clouds. I couldn't believe what I was seeing so I searched to see if anyone around was witnessing the same thing, but there was nobody else around. I looked up to see the object again, only to catch a blur of it speeding away. I dismissed the whole event until I realized I had captured it on film later that evening as I was reviewing all the pictures I has taken that day."],"Longitude":"-97.693895","Case Number":"41502","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There was one other sighting in Austin on or around July 9th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/07/2012 01:18 UTC","Summary":"round metalic disc with dome in center","Object Features":"Dome","Latitude":"30.429494","Region":"Texas","City":"Austin","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41502.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41502_submitter_file1__ufo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41502.html"],"Object Shape":"Cylinder, Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.429494,+-97.693895(41502)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41502) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08072012-0004","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
