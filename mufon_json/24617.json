We turned to go back into our house, and noticed a strange fireball in the night sky. The light appeared to be falling into our atmosphere, it left a trail of light behind it, like what you would expect from a metorite or shooting star. The fireball then split into 2 lights and appeared to go into different directions, one of the lights seemed to burn out. Then the light that was left got brighter. Suddenly 3 more lights appeared, they seemed to move around each other, then made a very deliberate diamond shape. The lights seemed to stay in the sky for approx 10 minutes. I ran into the house and got my camera, but you can't really see anything on my picture. Then i tried to record it from my iphone, but you can only see a tiny dot of light. It was really amazing, and we would love to know if there is any explanation."],"Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"US-07182010-0009","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
