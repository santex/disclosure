I saw this nightly, once until 2:00am. It seemed slightly oval, even though it was small - yet larger than any surrounding star. Last night I watched it again even though it was cloudy. I have been puzzled by it's movement and that it returns, so decided to report and inquire about it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7043.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7043.html"],"City":"Grand Rapids","Longitude":"-93.530214","Region":"Minnesota","Summary":"Star-like object moving quickly in small circles, fades and returns, also darts.","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05192007-0001","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/13/2007 10:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/13/2007 10:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were no other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around May 13th 2007"]}
