I was looking at the stars through the open window, when I noticed that one of them was moving. At first I thought that I must just be so tired that my eyes were playing tricks on me. I kept watching and the light bobbed randomly in all directions, and a couple of times even moved around in a circle. The color of the light changed randomly, including white, red, orange, and yellow. At times I think I saw fainter lights shoot out from the main light that was bobbing around, but they were so faint that I'm not positive. Some of my thoughts while observing--\"That's a UFO. I'm actually seeing a UFO. I thought that if this ever happened I'd be a lot more scared. I'm really glad that thing seems so far away.\" I watched until the light dropped behind the trees across the street from my house. I considered getting in the car and driving to where I could get an unobstructed view but was too scared to do so by myself."],"Longitude":"-120.831256","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oregon","Log Number":"US-07102012-0012","Case Number":"40661","Date Submitted":"07/10/2012 04:29 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40661.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40661.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/10/2012 01:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.308358,+-120.831256(40661)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40661) map </A>","Summary":"Red/orange/yellow/white bobbing light--would have mistaken this for a star if it hadn't been moving.","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash","City":"Prineville"}
