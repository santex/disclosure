I have been able to get glimpses of them every day and as a result I have ordered a high definition camcorder with night vision from the US and intend to capture these phenomenon on video. For practice, and because I am getting better at spotting them I took a regular camera outside at about 6 AM this morning to see if I could get one on camera. I did. It was difficult as they do not show up in the view finder and they travel extremely fast. So one just has to \"shoot from the hip\" so to speak. In the photo attached you can see the ufo to the far right, above the last blue star."],"Region":"Alberta","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"CA-02092012-0003","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35576.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35576_submitter_file1__IMG_2405.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35576.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.530808,+-113.413359(35576)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35576) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"02/09/2012 06:10 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball"}
