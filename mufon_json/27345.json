They lease parts of the ranch to other cattlemen for grazing. The clay soils are saturated due to all the rain we've been having the week before but he had never seen anything like this on the isolated gated property. It looked like the beef cows had run in a compacted oval-shaped ring long and hard enough to create a one foot trench around it until finally being able to leave it. (The cows were quietly grazing the hills by the time they got out there). They checked the area and found no tire tracks, no holes in or out of the circle, no evidence of being fed hay or some other feed that would bring them in so closely, and no other areas of disturbed ground. They took no pictures. We are due for rain later in this week. Have you ever heard of anything like this? I used to have contacts with many MUFON people in the past and don't know if any one I know is still with you."],"Latitude":"36.780201","Region":"California","Case Number":"27345","Log Number":"US-01102011-0013","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-119.411232","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.780201,+-119.411232(27345)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27345) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/10/2011 10:54 UTC","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/07/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
