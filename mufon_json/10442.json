It was much higher then my window that from the ground up about 8 feet high, our home is on pier blocks and cinder blocks. The distance was about twenty feet in front of us and about sixty feet up. It was awesome it was doing gravitational pulls left and right and left and right. Awesome! It appeared to be a silver tone saucer. The window had no screens on it so we stuck our heads out the window and watched the saucer until it passed out of sight. The saucer that we saw out my window with the gravitational pull appeared to be silver, I don't recall any lights on it, but it made NO sound. Pretty common with them not to make noise. If one did I would think it's ours, and not theirs?"],"Date of the Event":"04/28/2000 04:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Grants Pass","There were no other sightings in Grants Pass on or around April 28th 2000"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10442.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10442.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10442.html"],"Case Number":"10442","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-123.323982","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.448187,+-123.323982(10442)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10442) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","City":"Grants Pass","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"dull metallic saucer flew by within 20 feet of witnesses at very high rate of speed"}
