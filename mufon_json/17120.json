{"City":"New York","Date of the Event":"05/24/2009 10:05 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my girlfriend were taking a night walk. I was just looking up at the sky because it was so beautiful out...every star was shining in the sky.I then noticed a big bright light in the sky moving very slowly in a west to east direction. This light almost looked like a close...very bright white star. It obviously was not a star...because it was moving, and it was definetly not a plane. There were no wing lights flashing...it was a white..solid ball of light. As I was watching this light, it suddenly began to fade away very fast till I could'nt see it anymore. Just to mention...we saw a similar light the night before that behaved the same exact way. I would love to have tooken some pictures of them...but I didnt have access to a camera at the time."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.716353","Region":"New York","Date Submitted":"05/24/2009 10:05 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.716353,+-74.000733(17120)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17120) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17120.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17120.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Summary":"Big bright light then disappeared.","Log Number":"US-05242009-0020","Longitude":"-74.000733","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around May 24th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"17120","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON"}
