I looked up and saw flashing lights, but they seemed odd. They were almost pulsating in a rhythm or pattern and they went from white, to yellow, to orange, to red, and some green thrown in. I watched for a bit, but then played with the fog. In a minute or so I checked and could still see it, but now another was approaching from the same path. Over about 10-12 minutes I observed 5 of these come from the southeast or south and head north or northwest. I called my sister who lives northwest of me and she saw them as well."],"Latitude":"42.74148","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Clarkston","Longitude":"-83.414714","Summary":"5 separate vehicles flew toward the exact point in the north/northeast at intervals...","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44190.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44190.html"],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"44190","Log Number":"US-11282012-0001","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
