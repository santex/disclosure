We watched for 3-4 minutes until it disappeared from view. We guessed the altitude at 30,000-35,000 feet. Degrees up we estimated at 45-50 degrees. We could not see structure. The apparent size might be a baby aspirin, and the transit I've estimated at 18 inches, which would be approximately 45 degrees. Observing the zigzag movement of the object, my friend and I turned to each other and said, \"That's not an airplane; that's a UFO!\""],"Longitude":"-94.288473"}
