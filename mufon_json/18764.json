It is a clear night with lots of stars, when something caught my eye in the northeast. It was at a very high angle and moving in a southerly direction, at first I thought it was a sattelite, when suddenly it became extremely bright, then dimmed again still traveling until in a second or two it disapeared. I heard no engines, it was very quiet out there. I ran inside to get my camera hoping it would reappear, but it never did, this all took place about a half hour ago. I'm going back out in case it comes back. Hopefully I can get a picture."],"Case Number":"18764","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Auburn","There were no other sightings in Auburn on or around August 19th 2009"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08192009-0020","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"44.103541","Summary":"a dim star which got intensely bright, then dimmed northeast traveling south, NOT A PLANE OR SATTELITE OR STAR!
