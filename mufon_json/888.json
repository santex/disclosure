At first, Ithought it was a helicopter, but when I turned off the jacuzzi jets so I couldhear the aircraft, I heard only a very faint, distant sounding rumble or jetroar. The aircraft disappeared and then reappeared heading from NE to SW, againrather slowly. After watching it for about 4 or 5 minutes, we went back toenjoying our hot tub. (I was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs)P.S. Iwould only like to be contacted by e-mail!!!) Thanks for all of your efforts!
