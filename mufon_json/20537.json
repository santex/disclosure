(contractor) for the research and development dept.i had gone home to my travel trailer at the trailer park after work,took my shower, watched tv, and later that night got hungry and didn't feel like cooking so late at night, so i decided to go to wendy's for a midnight snack. the approximate time was about 1 am. i'm not sure of the exact date\\month, (its been 8 years since i experienced this). while driving my van back to my temp home away from home i saw a strange orange glowing object, shaped like a large m&m over the tree line a few miles from where i was driving.(i was heading west)it was very dark out and clear, it slowly hovered over the tree line in a southerly direction until it got almost in a direct line with the road i was on, but still miles away. it stopped then rotated at about a 70 degree angle,it waited a few seconds i could then see that it was a round saucer shape, but as i say like an m&m shape on the side view. it then accelerated at an unbelievable speed up into the clear night sky and out of sight. i build and worked on aircraft for the past 30+ years and was an aircraft mechanic in the navy for 6 years onboard the carrier nimitz and stationed at patuxent river maryland at the naval air test center.i know the capabilities of jet aircraft and the speeds they can attain. nothing i've ever seen could accelerate that fast, and it didn't leave a fire trail as a jet would do during night ops. i was excited, stunned and in awe at the object and how fast this object went. within seconds of the object leaving, another one came from the northern side of the tree line and did the exact same manuver, leaving at unbelievable speed. during the second object sighting i floored the gas to get closer. i was driving about 80 mph trying to get a better look to confirm exactly what it was? then a third object with the same glowing orange color as the first two appeared and did the exact same maneuver the other two did till it was out of sight. i had no camera, i actually looked for someone else on the road to stop them and make them look at what i was seeing. there were no other cars on the road. this all happened near i believe its hunter airforce base or fort stewart. i know one of those facilities is in that area. i went to work the next day and told the guys at work. as i expected they asked what i was drinking when i saw these objects. i don't drink ! i didn't like the ridicule so i just kept my mouth shut and didn't tell anyone else about it. i've kept this mostly secret the past 8 years, i have told a few people about it, and my family knows of it. but to protect my status as an aircraft technician and not being labeled crazy i kept quiet about it. i'm convinced that what i saw was either from another world, another time, or some super secret thing the government is hiding.(i doubt the government could ever have a craft like that hidden) no jet aircraft that i know of could ever reach that type of speed so quickly and be out of sight in mere seconds as all three of the objects did. i watched them go so fast till they went out of human sight. plus the fact of the \"g's that would have been experienced by any occupants of a craft going at that speed from a dead stop to out in space, would be phenominal. i truly believe they were from another world, highly intelligent, and curious about us. anyone who thinks that we are alone in this vast universe needs to rethink what they believe. we are just a speck in the vast expanse of the universe. with billions of planets in a galaxy, and millions of galaxies in the universe, you'd have to be pretty closed minded not to think about the odds that there is other intelligent life out there. perhaps smarter than we are and able to explore other planets.(which we can't even do yet) and because of the concept of fear to the public, the government will keep it hush hush about any other life out there that they may know about to prevent panic. my guess is they already know !!! it convinced me seeing them and i believe now !!! i wonder what they are like?"],"Case Number":"20537","Log Number":"US-11162009-0004","Latitude":"32.089541","Date of the Event":"09/30/2000 01:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-81.093184","Source":"MUFON","City":"Savannah","Summary":"Driving home saw 3 separate glowing objects slowly hover over tree line, then leave upwards at tremendous speed.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Georgia","Object Shape":"Disc","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"11/16/2009 01:08 UTC"}
