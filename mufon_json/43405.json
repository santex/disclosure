I saw a plane and something that looks like a bright star near it. At first I had a sense that it was moving but after watching it for more than a minute, it was standing still in the sky. It was strange because no planet or bright star was expected to be there. I went to my room to bring my telescope (30 seconds), when I was back it was gone."],"Longitude":"23.328601","Date of the Event":"10/15/2012 06:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.700472,+23.328601(43405)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43405) map </A>","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sofia","There were no other sightings in Sofia on or around October 15th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.700472","Region":"Sofia-grad","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"10/20/2012 11:00 UTC","Country":"Bulgaria","Case Number":"43405","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43405.html"],"Summary":"star like object that suddenly disappears"}
