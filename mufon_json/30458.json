After being there for about ten minutes two younger children had pointed up in the sky and said what's that?. We had stopped what we were doing and watch this basketball shaped bright orange object move across the sky we knew exactly what it was. It seemed like it came out of no where and we watched it. As it moved from east to west it seemed like it was going fast then slowing down, going fast then slowing down again. When it was changing speed it seemed to have been leaving a trail. We watched it for about 3 min and then it just disapeared. This isnt the first time we had seen something at this location."],"Latitude":"40.661219","Date Submitted":"08/08/2011 06:15 UTC"}
