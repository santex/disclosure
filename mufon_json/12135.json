From this area I saw what looked liked a tubular red, green object shaped like a boomerang and it was huge!!! It was hovering very low over the lake. Then as we went down the road a light was coming from the field and it came over the tree line literally right over our car on the road on my side of the car. It was some sort of structure not solid, but silver tubed that had two green lights on each side of it and a bright white light in the middle. The lights were very pure and bright As it came over the car I looked to my left, in front and in back of me. Nothing could be seen of anything except what looked almost like a purlpe light that lit up the area around us for a second and it was gone. There was no noise at all. On another lake as we got settled I saw small green orbs almost star like come what seemed like out of nowhere from the south and traveled west slowly behind the trees on the other side of the lake."],"City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12135.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12135.html"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.320334,+-85.597474(12135)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12135) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"44.320334"}
