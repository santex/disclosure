We did not hear any engines so we ruled out a plane. We watched it move across the sky where it appeared to be rotating, and it would speed up and slow down. At one point it did an abrubt 45 degree turn and then continued on a rather straight line. It appeared to be getting brighter and then dimmer. It was very bright then it just dissapeard. We then noticed it coming from another direction doing the same thing. I used binoculars to view the object, and every time I got a stable view, it seemed to either change coarse or speed up and disappear. At that point my wife captured the light on video with our camcorder. In the video it went from bring close to us, to being extremely far away with in 10 seconds. It was also moving at a very steady speed, then faded in and out and was gone."],"Longitude":"-80.286452"}
