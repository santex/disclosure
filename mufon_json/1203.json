Im now 44 yearsold. The sun was low with no clouds, but it was still daylight. My four friendswere playing when I looked up and saw a round object. It was stationary and notrotating. It was bluish-white, the same color as the moon and almost as bright.I could clearly see dark ring-shaped markings on its whiter background. Therewas a large ring in the center and five smaller rings spaced evenly around, butnot touching, the center ring. I could see this object absolutely clearly. Itsapparent size was almost the size of a quarter at arms length. It made nosound. I pointed to it and my friends all stopped to look. Then someone taggedme and it was gone."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.623262","Tags":"City","Summary":"Witness saw round object (prob. disk) with 5 ring","Country":"United States","Log Number":"","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Ames","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.03063,+-93.623262(1203)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1203) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/30/1963 07:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
