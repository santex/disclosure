I was in my driveway looking up and observing the stars. Out of the western sky above I saw a solid light moving toward where the sunrise is and to the south. So it was moving southeast. It looked like it was moving among the stars. I watched it move across the sky. And within 2 or 3 seconds of me losing sight of it, I saw what appeared to be a shooting star, but it moved up and out of view. It made a trail going up instead of down like meteors do. It was moving very swiftly. It didn't rake long for it to cross the sky. Any questions please email me."],"trends":[],"Latitude":"27.674197","Case Number":"47517","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"saw what appeared to be a star moving very fast in the sky above.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.674197,+-81.507034(47517)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47517) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47517.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47517.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City"}
