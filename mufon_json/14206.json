It had two lights in the front middle and back. It was a very scary event because it didn't make a noise and we have never seen an obgect like this before. It looked hexagonal but half of it was covered with this fog or smoke. It was flying over the tree line of my front lawn and then about five minutes later it went or flew south towards the highway and looked like a star blinking very brightly. It was very slow at first but when it moved far down it went faster than anything I have ever seen with my eyes. It looked like a bolt of lighting when it left or took off. My Grandmom,Cousin,and a friend saw it also. I tried to take a picture of it and when I put my cellphone up to the sky it was just stars and black. After seeing this object we were very scared but interested in learning more."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.183464,+-74.915886(14206)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14206) map </A>","Latitude":"40.183464","City":"Langhorne","Summary":"It was hexagonal and was bigger than my house.","Case Number":"14206","Date of the Event":"11/28/2008 06:38 UTC","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14206.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14206.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Langhorne","There were no other sightings in Langhorne on or around November 28th 2008"],"Log Number":"US-12032008-0010","Longitude":"-74.915886","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
