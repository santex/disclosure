I am a pilot and love astronomy. I was looking up at the Big Dipper and Orion when I noticed movement. I looked at what was moving and got the impression I was not looking at an aircraft of this world. It had 4 white lights that were steady. The craft moved at around 200 knots in a straight line. My only caveat is that it was flying along a common approach for American Eagle out of DFW heading to TXK. Their flights are due in around 9 PM however, the could be late. The craft was at an altitude that I would expect an approaching Am. Eagle, around 2,500 AGL. The reason I don't believe that it was an American Eagle plane, or any other plane, is that it did not have a red beacon, red and green recog lights, or strobes. It also made no noise whatsoever, whereas you can hear American Eagle planes as well as other private planes. The Diamond was not perfect.
