It was only there for a second or so. But it was similar to the way that meteor made the sky turn bright in the Canada incident. I know that on a different occasion I saw some electric blue object bolt for a cloud before, and it was so high up in the sky, yet it's light was so potent that I noticed it from thousands of miles below. I don't know that this could have been the same object but whatever was so strong that it made the whole sky turn very bright in a flash. I don't know what it was."],"Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","Case Number":"14507","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Huntington Park","There were no other sightings in Huntington Park on or around December 21st 2008"],"Longitude":"-118.216602","Date of the Event":"12/21/2008 09:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Huntington Park","Date Submitted":"12/21/2008 09:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.985051,+-118.216602(14507)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14507) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12232008-0011"}
