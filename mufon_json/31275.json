{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI shot this picture during my trip to Brussels in Belgium (see picture for location). It was a nice sunset so, I shot few pictures of it. When I look at them few days after, I saw this weird spot on the bottom left of one of the picture. I don't think this is a cloud because of the orientation, shape and it is a little brighter than the rest of the clouds around. I didn't see a plane, birds or any kind of activity in the sky at the moment I was taking the pictures. I took 6 pictures with an interval of 45 sec to 1 min (approx) and this weird thing appears only on the third picture. I show that picture to some friends and they couldn't give me an answer of what is this. I hope you can find something of this. Cheers."],"Date Submitted":"08/29/2011 11:29 UTC","Latitude":"50.853625","Log Number":"BE-08292011-0012","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31275.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31275_submitter_file1__ScreenShot2011-08-29at15.55.29.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31275_submitter_file2__DSC_2553.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31275_submitter_file3__DSC_2553-zoomcopy.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31275.html"],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Disc, Unknown","Country":"Belgium","Region":"Brussels","Longitude":"4.362162","Summary":"Wierd objet between the clouds","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Brussels","There were no other sightings in Brussels on or around August 8th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.853625,+4.362162(31275)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31275) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Date of the Event":"08/08/2011 09:05 UTC","City":"Brussels","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"31275","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
