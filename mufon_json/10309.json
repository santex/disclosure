It stayed with us for about 10 minutes and then sped off in a very high rate of speed (almost in a flash). I was 8-9 years old but remember it very well. I think we were going north at about 60 mph maybe 25 miles in the desert from the caverns. This is the first of two encounters I have had."],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Carlsbad","There were no other sightings in Carlsbad on or around July 15th 1958"],"Log Number":"US-04132008-0014","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.425944,+-104.219428(10309)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10309) map </A>","Region":"New Mexico","Date of the Event":"07/15/1958 03:15 UTC","Longitude":"-104.219428","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/15/1958 03:15 UTC"}
