We lost sight of them after they passed behind a tree. The red sphere was behind and to the left of the white one as if flying in formation. They moved from SW to NE and began flying upward just before our view was blocked by the tree. We both lost sight of them at that point. The spheres appeared to be about twice the size of the star Betelgeuse which was visible at the time. The sky was clear. We didn���t hear any sound."]}
