About three seconds after looking straight up we saw a trail of twinkling golden colored lights spread out from north to south in the shape of a rectangle. It appeared for a few seconds and then just vanished. It was not a commercial plane, the lights just went on and off with a width of about 5 inches (if measuring from ground perspective). I would say it was about 45,000 ft. in the air. We just ran inside freaked out. We never really had sight of the object, just the trail and it just vanished."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Longitude":"-77.531992","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.36209,+-77.531992(6856)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6856) map </A>","Summary":"Never saw UFO - was at night - only saw trail","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-04202007-0009"}
