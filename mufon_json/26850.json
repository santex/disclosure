{"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Florida","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my car in the Starbucks parking lot about 3 to about 3:20 pm when I noticed two little bright streak that remained unchanged for the few minutes I was there. I pointed it out to my daughter but she had difficulty seeing it because it was very sunny and bright. The object did not seem to move at all but had the same bright small streaks like what follows an airplane. It was just so strange that just stayed in one place. It seemed to be some distance away towards Tampa. At first I thought it was an airplane which I've seen many times in our airspace but then it did not act like a plane in that it was still. I then had thoughts that it might be an unidentified object and I needed to let someone know so it could be checked out. I didn't have opportunity to take a photo and don't think my cell phone camera would have picked it up. I lost sight of it when I drove away assuming it was still there but unable to locate again as I drove along the road near there."],"Date of the Event":"12/03/2010 03:15 UTC","City":"Plant City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26850.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26850.html"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"26850","Summary":"Hanging in the distance over the trees behind Starbucks","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-12042010-0009","Latitude":"28.026432","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.026432,+-82.105934(26850)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26850) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.105934","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Plant City","There were no other sightings in Plant City on or around December 3rd 2010"],"Date Submitted":"12/04/2010 08:36 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
