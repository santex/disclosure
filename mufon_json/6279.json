{"Log Number":"US-01302007-0014","Date of the Event":"07/31/1957 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsOne night in the summer of 1957 I was at the drive-in with a date. During the movie I noticed a V-shaped set of lights, apex leading, coming from the North. There was a road behind the drive-in where cars sometimes parked to watch the movies free, but the configuration of lights was puzzeling. I wondered if the lights were reflections on my windshield from behind us or if they were actually lights in the sky. I stepped out of the car and watched a V of 9 lights cross above the screen, North to South, disappearing to the South. The lights were white, not blinking and there was no other color associated with them. No sound was heard. They were in view for approximately 3 minutes. I was surprised that they traveled from horizon to horizon in 3 to 5 minutes without making a sound."],"Latitude":"35.593932","Summary":"Triangle of lights passing North to South","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Las Vegas","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6279.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6279.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"07/31/1957 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.593932,+-105.223897(6279)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6279) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around July 31st 1957"],"Longitude":"-105.223897","Case Number":"6279","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Tags":"City","Region":"New Mexico","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
