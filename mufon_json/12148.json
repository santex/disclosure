It sounded pretty low so I grabbed my digital camera to take some pictures of it. I took several pictures of the helicopter as it was flying a bit eratic, and only about 300-500 feet elevation. I figured they may be looking for someone on foot or a vehicle. I did not notice any other objects in the sky when I was taking the pictures. Later when I was showing my wife the pictures she noticed when we zoomed in on the helicopter, in every picture there was an object either around the helicopter or the helicopter facing the direction of the object(s). On one photo I was able to zoom in and see \"Police\" on the side of the helicopter. Don't know what these were but thought I would let you take a look."],"Latitude":"43.281413","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.281413,+-83.529677(12148)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12148) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/19/2008 02:11 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/19/2008 02:11 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"12148","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12148.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12148_submitter_file1__IMG_0750.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12148_submitter_file2__IMG_0752.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12148_submitter_file3__IMG_0753.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12148.html"],"Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Millington","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Summary":"Helicopter with orbs or disc's around it.","Log Number":"US-08202008-0008"}
