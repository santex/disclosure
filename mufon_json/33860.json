I was about to get up and I was just thinking about differnt things going on in the world and all of a sudden I seen a white orb drop out of one of the star like objects and I told my husband and we both were looking at these star like objects and I didn't know what to make of it. After that I was walking towards the restroom and in there there is large window and a nice view of the sky. Well as I walk into the bathroom I see this white ball of light outside flash a light at me almost like someone taking a picture then disappeard. This kind of freaked me out and I couldn't sleep the next night. I should also mention I have witnessed a gold color ball of light in my bedroom floating at the foot of my bed on two occasions, and when I get up it disapperd and I have seen it shoot off through the window. We live near the livermore Airport and these were not planes or helicopters."],"Region":"California"}
