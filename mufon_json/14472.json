We pulled over to watch it and we saw what looked to be a pattern of dimming. Than about 2min into it we saw on light to the left of the first light come in and begin to blink in and out then a third light would apear in the middle and do the same. I notice that they would go and out randomly in sync they never moved. so after 5 min of watching it we headed to the inlaws to get there camera when we came back one light was blinking as we began to take a shot it would disapear like ti new what we was trying to do. So i put the camera into record mode and it disapeared totaly. After sitting there for 5 min nothing came about. I was shocked and amazed cause once we go the camera it into record mode it just stopped."],"City":"Phoenix","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12212008-0001","Summary":"3 light sighting.","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-112.071347","Case Number":"14472","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.450447,+-112.071347(14472)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14472) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14472.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14472.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/20/2008 09:19 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Latitude":"33.450447","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Flash"}
