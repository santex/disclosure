{"Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI work for a preschool and every morning a co-worker and I do a bus route. About a month or so ago we seen a light in the sky during our morning bus route, the light would stay on for about 10 secs and then turn off for about 10 secs. On March 11, in the same location on our bus route we seen a very bring light in the sky. The time was around 6:45 am. As we moved towards the lights (driving east) they were also moving towards us (flying west). They lights banked and turned North - Northwest. As they turned we seen it was three lights that made a Delta or triangle shape. There was no blinking lights with the first sighting or this sighting. In this area, we are close to the Fort Smith airport and could have easliy been an airplane. But the shape and lack on any blinking light is why I am reporting this."],"Date Submitted":"03/11/2009 06:45 UTC","Longitude":"-94.173264","City":"Lavaca","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03122009-0013","Summary":"Delta shape lights.","Case Number":"15983","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lavaca","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Arkansas","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/11/2009 06:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.336202,+-94.173264(15983)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15983) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15983.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15983.html"],"Latitude":"35.336202","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
