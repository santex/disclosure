{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-12212012-0009","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at home last night, getting ready to settle in and had this overwhelming urge to look out my East facing window. When I did, I saw something circling in the sky over a residential area. It was dark so it was hard to see the shape of the object but it almost looked spherical with a steady green light and slow flashing red light emanating from it. It did not look like anything I've ever seen in the sky and it was definitely not a helicopter or airplane. I watched it for a few minutes and noticed it quickly circled around 3 or 4 times with a diameter of a few hundred feet and probably a few hundred feet above the residential area. After it was done circling, it hovered for about a minute or two and then took off in a southwest direction somewhat close to my house. I felt really strange after seeing this and wanted to grab my camera at the time but wasn't sure if it would show up because it was so dark and I also didn't want to miss it. After it took off, I have no idea where it ended up."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","trends":["There have been 76 other sightings in Calgary","There were no other sightings in Calgary on or around December 20th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"12/20/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Fast circling UFO with steady green light and slow flashing red light.","Region":"Alberta","City":"Calgary","Case Number":"44702","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"12/21/2012 04:51 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.050195,+-114.050351(44702)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44702) map </A>","Latitude":"51.050195","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44702.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44702.html"],"Longitude":"-114.050351"}
