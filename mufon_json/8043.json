Night had fallen and the stars had come out. The campground was quieting down for the night, and I was sitting at our dying campfire, watching the skies. There were a couple of satellites high up, and a few airplanes flying at cruising altitude. There are no large airports nearby. I noticed a dark red sphere, roughly half to a mile high, crossing the sky silently, from southwest to northeast. It had no lights, no comtrail, and made no sound. It was not catching the sunlight from the sun setting over the horizon, but also did not seem to have any running lights. It was illuminated just enough to be seen against the darkening sky. It crossed the sky in about 90 seconds before going out of sight over the far horizon. The campground is on the slope of a river valley so I I had a panoramic view of the sky and of the flightpath of the object. I saw no other objects or pursuing aircraft."]}
