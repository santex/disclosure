She had her camera with her and she took 4 pictures within a minute and a half. The first and last pictures don't seem to have anything that I can see. But the second and third pictures capture a UFO. Picture 114 clearly shows an orange colored UFO and picture 115 taken 18 seconds later show the UFO has a blue tone and is much further away. Since you only have three spots for download I will send the last 3 of the 4 pictures."],"Date of the Event":"07/16/2008 11:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.954205"}
