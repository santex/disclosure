{"Summary":"UFO fireball that changed direction","Case Number":"36302","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside of Good Samaritan Hospital on Maxwell street, having a cigarette break with a nurse and a nurse tech. I was facing downtown they were facing the hospital. I was looking at my iPhone to find a link of a baby picture to show them when my cell phone went a bit crazy.. kind of like noise you see on a tv channel that isn't working! That was weird. One of my friends said \" wow what is going on with your iPhone!\" I looked up at him and I saw a fireball object hovering for a split second, then it moved to the left then up and to the right and then it fell in a trajectory fashion like a falling star... I quickly said \"did you guys see that\" as it disappeared behind the building. By the time they looked the big fireball looking thing disappeared to what seemed to be a trajectory decent to the north of lexington."],"Longitude":"-84.501302","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Lexington","There were no other sightings in Lexington on or around March 6th 2012"],"Latitude":"38.0434","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36302.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36302.html"],"Log Number":"US-03072012-0007","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"03/07/2012 09:42 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.0434,+-84.501302(36302)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36302) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"Kentucky","City":"Lexington","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/06/2012 04:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
