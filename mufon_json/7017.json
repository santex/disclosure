At first I thought it was a few military planes flying in formation, as this area is some kind of military flight training area. But after watching them move for a while, I wasn't so sure about that explanation as it didn't look like they were going anywhere fast, they were just kind of slowly lumbering across the sky. I watched them for about maybe five or six minutes, and they were heading in my general direction. The lights finally disappeared behind a nearby mountain and that was the last I saw of them. I related this story to a friend that I didn't think would call me crazy. He told me about a big UFO flap in this same area in the late 1980s with some sightings matching my description. That is what has led me to research more into this whole thing. I'm very weirded out by it all."],"Longitude":"-81.076881"}
