First my daughter Martha described her experience. Then Connie told me what happened to her. John described an \"owl\" who came in the window \"But he didn't get me, I hid between th edge of the mattress and the wall\" Then the most detailed information came from a child who,at that time was a little less than four. Finally, exactly a year later they came for me. Three Aliens named Xeno, Nem and Omah took me away and removed ovum All of these contacts happened at night probibly after one AM in our bedrooms. I have kept this to myself for years and told the children not to discuss anything about their experiences because I didn't want to get the reputation of being mentally ill and I wanted to avoid our being the \"crazy McCann Family\" At that time NO ONE believed in Aliens or Flying Saucers and if I had spoken of it I would have had personal difficulties with neighbors and others.Times have changed and if anything I can say could be helpful I will cooperate fully."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-74.049304","Summary":"abduction examination medical","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.126226,+-74.049304(21253)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21253) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/18/1964 02:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21253.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21253.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"New Jersey","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/29/2009 08:09 UTC","Country":"United States"}
