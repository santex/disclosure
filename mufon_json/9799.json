It looked like it was coming out of the ground, but I assume it was behind the hill. We waited a while to share this because it frightened the hell out of us. No sound, however it did seem to flip backwards and fall behind the hills. That was it. Would have been along US highway 97. I have 2 more pictures, however they are blurry due to the low light."],"Date Submitted":"05/25/2006 07:01 UTC","Latitude":"45.453175","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Dufur","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-03022008-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
