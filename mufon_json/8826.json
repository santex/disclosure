We were traveling south on a gravel road at approx. 30 mph. My girlfriend noticed it first. She asked, \"What's that bright light?\" Off to the east approx. 300 yards out and up 100-150 feet there was the most brilliant light I have ever seen. It did not shine in any particular direction. It just radiated and it did not appear to move. From our vantage point it was about the size of a quarter. I had no idea what it could be. We stopped the car and I got out. The light was gone. I listened and all I heard was the silence of a North Dakota winter night. No nothing for 3-4 minutes and the light never reappeared. We have no idea what we saw, but what a way to start the New Year."],"City":"New Town","Case Number":"8826","Latitude":"47.980848","Sighting Duration":"00:02:15","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/01/2008 02:30 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in New Town","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.980848,+-102.49018(8826)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8826) map </A>","Longitude":"-102.49018","Log Number":"US-01112008-0007","Tags":"City"}
