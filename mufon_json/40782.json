It affected the radio, or cd player anyway. It proceeded a straight path over the car as I turned down Glendale, the object was heading towards Niagara Falls. Then when the object got over us and past us on the other side of the car, it either simply disappeared, or somehow shadowed itself so it wouldn't be seen. At first I thought it was a jet. When the object affected the Cd, my wife was mad that her cd the one that never skips, was skipping now. We both saw it but we didn't have any bad feelings about it. I lost sight of it because I think it either flew fast towards Niagara Falls, or it just simply disappeared."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/14/2012 12:00 UTC","Summary":"A Triangle Shape With Bright White Lights","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in St Catharines","There were no other sightings in St Catharines on or around July 14th 2012"],"Country":"Canada","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"12:35:26","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40782.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40782.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
