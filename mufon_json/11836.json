{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhat I saw was most likely a satellite. I was just finishing watering my plants about 10:15 PM PDT when I noticed a bright white light, about as bright as Jupiter, moving west to east across the northern sky. I watched it move, thinking it was too big, too bright, and too fast to be a satellite. I watched it from just past the middle of the northern sky until it went behind the trees on the northeastern horizon."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Graham","There were no other sightings in Graham on or around July 30th 2008"],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11836.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11836.html"],"Latitude":"47.052879","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/30/2008 10:15 UTC","Case Number":"11836","Longitude":"-122.294284","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Graham","Region":"Washington","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.052879,+-122.294284(11836)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11836) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07312008-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"big, bright, fast satellite","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"07/30/2008 10:15 UTC"}
