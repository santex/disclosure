(45 seconds or so?) i did stare at it and there was a constant stream of thought going on as i describe above. i simply checked left and then turned right and continued toward brooks (east); we went home and i don't think i even mentioned it to kathy until this evening. i guess i am used to doing what i'm told to do? wow. i do 3d cad for a living, so i made a rough model of it and tried to shade it like it appeared to me from memory. now i wish i had done this in 2009. i don't think kathy can be regarded a witness. we never actually spoke about it."],"Date Submitted":"03/13/2013 03:47 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/17/2009 03:00 UTC","Summary":"Pulled to stop sign, saw this object hovering.
