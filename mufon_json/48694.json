They moved in a triangular pattern much much larger than an airplane. The lights would go out, then come in again. Moving very slow but in a strict pattern and low like a thousand feet. I went on the internet and this is a common sighting that no one can explain. My friend said the news said it was helicopters, but even though she saw one she could not verify it was a helicopter. Neither could anyone else I talked to who saw the same thing. I searched helicopters with orange lights and no matches. And no, they were not the candle lanterns. It was way to much larger than that. The stealth's here do not have orange lights. And they do make noise, these did not. Very strange."],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 12:00 UTC"}
