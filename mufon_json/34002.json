{"Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Looking for shooting stars and saw a dull green pentagon shaped object made up of 6 orb-like spheres.","Date Submitted":"12/13/2011 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"33.072292","Longitude":"-80.183027","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"12/12/2011 11:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Summerville","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["sighting detailsi was in my back yard smoking a cigarette last night (approx. 11:00, 12\\12\\11). i remembered that there is going to be a pretty good meteor shower on 12\\14 so i looked up to see if there was anything i could see. as i was watching the sky, i did actually see about 4 shooting stars. i was looking almost straight up when something different from what i had seen of the shooting stars showed up. i didn't know what it could possibly be. we have planes flying over our home all time because we live near an airport so i have seen my fair share of lights in the sky. this object was totally unfamiliar to me. it was a pentagon shape made up of 6 orb-like dull green (swamp green) spheres. i couldn't see the actual object (if there was one); only the spheres that made up the shape. the spheres were located at each point of the pentagon and one in the middle of the object. the reason i say \"orb-like\" is because they didn't emit any light as i would expect them to. when it came into view, it was as if it were coming out of a cloak. i could see the object for about 2 seconds (flying straight) before it vanished the same way it came into view (cloaked). if you were in the dark with a flashlight and something passed by the beam of light, that's what it looked like except a light shining on this object would have made it more visible in my opinion. it took a second for me to realize i could have just witnessed a ufo. i contemplated in my mind what it could possibly have been to no avail. i stayed outside for a little longer to see if it came back or more could be visible but there was nothing else. there was not much time to analyze more detail of what i had just seen as it was here and gone so fast (about the speed of a shooting star). i finished my cigarette and went inside but didn't tell my wife about it immediately. i cleaned up the living room a little bit, grabbed a sheet of paper and a pen. i drew out the shape of the pentagram and showed it to my wife. i said, \"i just saw this in the sky.\" she asked if it had any lights on it and i said no then gave her the description from above. i went outside with my camera to try to take some long exposure shots of the sky to see if i could catch anything else but didn't see anything more. i wanted to make sure i remembered what i saw, so explaining it to my wife was my backup. this morning, i decided to make an animated gif image of what i had seen. i tried to make it as accurate as possible so i used a background image of last nights sky."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34002.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34002.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.072292,+-80.183027(34002)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34002) map </A>","Region":"South Carolina","Log Number":"US-12132011-0005","Case Number":"34002","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Summerville","There were no other sightings in Summerville on or around December 12th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
