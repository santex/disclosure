No sound, no blinking or colorful lights. It started moving towards the east after a minute, stopped and hovered for a few seconds.I said in my mind-There you guys are. What are you up to again?(I see them quite a lot lately.Then it took off to the east, floating gradually faster, climbing slightly, and speeding up slowly, then disappeared.Clear night, no planes in the area. Strange, because I see lots of them all over(this is a corridor and I'm on top of a mountain. I can see a large part of the sky, and it's rural, so there's not much light pollution."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
