When i got out of the car, I looked up at the clear night sky and saw 8 red orbs flying from the general direction of the East towards the West. They were all moving at the same speed in the same direction, in a scattered formation. They were moving quickly at the approximate altitude of a commercial plane. I am very familiar with seeing commercial planes, helicopters, and known military aircraft and these red orbs were unlike any known aircraft I had seen. The red orbs light did not pulsate or waver, and though the red light was bright, it did not give off any glare. Two of the orbs then effortlessly reversed and changed direction and manuevered next to another one of the orbs to form a perfect triangle flight formation with the third orb. The rest of the orbs stayed on the same flight path they were already on and did not create any other triangle formations. I watched them for approximately 2 minutes until they flew out of visual range."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"34.158785","Date of the Event":"04/12/1990 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-118.544836","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around April 12th 1990"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"8 red orbs over San Fernando Valley, April 1990, night sighting","Case Number":"40744","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.158785,+-118.544836(40744)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40744) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Los Angeles","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07122012-0018","Region":"California"}
