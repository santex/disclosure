I was using zoom and the line following the triangle craft is what the camera captured while the shutter was open. Unfortunately I was not using a tripod at the time, therefore the uneven looking line indicating travel of the craft. I was using a Nikon S630 with Night Landscape scene. I did not realize this object was captured until reviewing the files the next day."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.557471","Summary":"Triangle High Up captured on Digital Camera","Case Number":"17004","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/16/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17004.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17004_submitter_file1__MovingTriangle.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17004.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-105.774287","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
