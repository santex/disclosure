At the bottom of the object light orange had ring-shaped edge throughout the several rings on the edge and bottom. All the rest of the structure was black. It made no noise nehum. My wife and I could not leave the place, I can not assess the time of observation. The sky was very clear and cloudless starry, there was no moon in the sky, at least from our position. I know very well all types of aircraft, satellites, etc.. it was bizarre.
