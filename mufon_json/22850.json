{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar, Star-like","divs":["sighting detailsiwas standing outside in a well lit parking area thats lights washed out all but the brighter stars and planets.i work outside at night providing security and am able to observe the night sky.i am good at spoting satelites in the early morn9ing hours most nights.i also get to see some great shooting stars,airliners,small planes and helocopters and even sometimes large dark bats and lighter and higher,birds heading north west to i assume the marshes or ocean. i am able to tell the difference between these objects and except for the bats and birds i usually can tell right away what i'm seeing,be it a satelite or high up airliner. on the night of 4-08-2010 i was watching the sky where i had ealier seen a very good shooting star(southeast at about 30 degrees off the horizon).i noticed movement directly above me moving northwest very fast,as i looked up i saw a flash of movement go from about my 11 o'clock to about 3 o'clock or about 120 degrees.the object appeared to be lower than small airplanes,or about 1000 ft up.the object was very fast,made no sound,had orange dull lights at it's front and back and the section between the lights appeared as a shadow against the nights sky,but could be made out ,much as a black bat that flies above in the darkness can be seen black on black,but moving. the object must have been at least 100 ft long and possibly larger if it was more than my guess of 1\\4 mile above me. it flew from above my left shoulder when firmly spotted to my left horizon which was a five story building at my 3 o'clock,heading northwest towards santa cruz area as the crow flies. i was very startled and right away became highly scared.i checked my cell phone to bring some reality to what had just happened and it showed 3:14 a.m. moments later i spoke to supervisor during a routine check and he was supportive but a little unsure about my need to tell such a unbelievable tale to someone.if somthing like my experience happens unexpectedly i think it is normal to want to tell someone who walks by.in hindsight it probably is better thought about beofre telling just anyone,but ,oh well! i stayed at my post and now was hyper alert and keenly watching the sky .at about 3:50 a.m i observed a white light \"turn on\" in the due sout section of sky from me.the light was again a 1\\4 -1\\2 mile high or about 30 degrees.the object was about two miles due south of me and aproxamitly over the town of sprekles california.i was so startled to see a second object that i became almost in shock and did not check my cell phone for the exact time.the object appeared just as bright white star does,it did not blink or pulse,made no sound that i could hear and took straight off in the direction of the first sighting(northwest).the object moved in a straight path with no increase or change in speed.the speed appeared steady and much,much faster than the small planes that fly at that hiegth some nights, but not a streak like a shooting star. at 4:06 a.m ,very alert now,i observed a third object \"turn on in almost the same area of sky as the second object(bright white light)it may have been another mile south at most,copied the first light in every aspect,and wisked away heading northwest,also amking no apparent noise. i am reporting this in hopes of bringing some details into record of a very unusual sighting i observed in the monterey bay area. thank you for taking the time to read this."],"Date of the Event":"04/08/2010 03:14 UTC","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Salinas","There were no other sightings in Salinas on or around April 8th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-04162010-0004","Tags":"City","Summary":"long straight object dull orange lights front and rear....followed ...by two white orbs twenty ,and 35 minutes later....","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"22850","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","City":"Salinas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.680737,+-121.652261(22850)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22850) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/16/2010 04:10 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.680737","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22850.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22850.html"],"Longitude":"-121.652261"}
