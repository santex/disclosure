But when I looked directly at the object, I saw it wasn't a plane, but a black triangle with bright white lights at each corner and it was no more than 500 feet above tree tops and was stationary. I kept looking at it for about a minute while driving and noticed a plane take off in the distance, which further showed me how stationary this object was. Every so often after that I would keep watching the object and check back to the road since I was driving, and after a total time of about two minutes of looking at this object it disappeared while I was doing a road check. The road check lasted only 3 - 4 seconds and the object had completely vanished from sight."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 112 other sightings in Orlando","There were no other sightings in Orlando on or around January 9th 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","City":"Orlando","Summary":"Black triangle with a bright white light at each corner","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/09/2007 05:59 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Florida","Longitude":"-81.373636","Date of the Event":"01/09/2007 05:59 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7968.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7968.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"28.545526"}
