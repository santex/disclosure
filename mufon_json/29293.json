I noticed two orange objects moving across the sky about the speed of a fast satellite. They were not very bright and there were some thin clouds above. After a a few seconds one appeared to veer off at almost a right angle. Then both disappeared. I noticed them because of the movement and the fact that they were different than any shooting star I have seen before. When I first noticed the two they reminded me of satellites because of the speed. They were bigger than a star. When one veered off that was something I had never seen before. I felt that I had seen something unusual. I looked on the internet and saw similar reports about fast moving orange objects--wow. So what were they?"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"two orange objects moving quickly then one veered off and both disappeared","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Chaska","There were no other sightings in Chaska on or around May 29th 2011"],"Case Number":"29293","Tags":"City","Region":"Minnesota","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"44.798245","Date Submitted":"05/29/2011 02:32 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-05292011-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29293.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29293.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/29/2011 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.798245,+-93.596469(29293)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29293) map </A>","City":"Chaska"}
