At about six pm while watching tv and having dinner, my aunt and I heard what sounding like fighter jets go just above the house. We took notice, but didn't think much about it at the time. Within two to three hours either the battery or electrical systems failed on three cars. At just after six, my cousin was unable to start her car. At about eight pm, another family member and a friend were also unable to start their cars. After hearing these stories, I just had the feeling these events were UFO related. I thought it was important enough to report it to your organization."]}
