I called inside to my 13 year old daughter and had her look at it too. She saw it the same as I did. 5 minutes later my neighbor also came out and I pointed it out to him and he saw the same thing. This whole time it never moved at all. Then I put a post onto facebook and while I was getting comments about it being Mars or the Sirius star, the red light sped off straight up just like a really fast rocket and disappeared."],"trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There were 2 other sightings in Boise on or around December 24th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"12/25/2011 12:50 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12252011-0005","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34284.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34284.html"],"City":"Boise"}
