I saw two lights spiraling around each other, orbiting a center point. The lights then seperated and one light hovered and the other turned into what looked like 6 smaller lights which formed an equilateral triangle. The traingle then rotated around a center axis a few rotations and then they kind of just closed in on each other and disappeared. The other large light in the sky also disappeared. It all happened really fast and thats as best as I can explain what I saw. FWIW this is the first time I have ever seen any UFOs before."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Illinois","Longitude":"-88.245955","Date Submitted":"07/29/2013 03:24 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07292013-0008","Summary":"Two spiraling lights transforming into triangle which rotated around central axis","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.22115,+-88.245955(49281)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49281) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/29/2013 01:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"42.22115"}
