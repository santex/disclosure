Then a seconf one emerged from the smoke.I was stunned.I couldnt see what happened to the small ufos,they dropped off behind some trees. Then the lsrge ufo moved about five miles an hour over my home,no noise not a whisper.It remained the same height as the street light pole,not going up or down.The material looked very matte and finely lined in a circular pattern. It was beautiful very velvety looking black.It was very low over the building I was in. Also is their someone I can contack about a small appx four foot alien standing in my bedroom.I sat up looked and it just disappeared.Im not crazy I just cant tell anyone they would not believe me.
