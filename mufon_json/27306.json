As I waited for it to clear, not moving my possition, I realized it had disappeared. I figured I was halucinating and said nothing to no one. The same summer of 2010 I also witnessed two jets flying over the skys of Middlesex County, NJ when one cloaked for about three seconds reappeared, recloaked for about three seconds, reappeared for about three seconds and recloaked. The amazing thing about the event is that the cloaked jet also lost,masked,or cloaked it's contrails. What spurred me to recount this was a MUFON show on History where a gentleman out west recounted a simslar experience to your investigators. I had never mentioned this to anyone before now. 1.
