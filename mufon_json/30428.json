He was looking up at the sky and said, \"Look baby, a UFO.\", We parked the car so I could get a better look. I got out my cell phone to take a picture, and as soon as I got out of the car and pointed my phone at the UFO it disappeared. A few minutes after we saw a blinking red light and what appeared to be 2 jets. I didn't believe in Aliens until last night. We live on a back road, and its normally people out in the middle of nowhere that get abducted, I'm a little afraid that is going to happen to us."],"Summary":"Four lights in a row","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.058703,+-97.633377(30428)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30428) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Boyd","There were no other sightings in Boyd on or around July 28th 2011"],"City":"Boyd"}
