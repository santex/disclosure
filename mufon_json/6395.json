{"Tags":"City","divs":["sighting detailsi'm normally very sceptical about ufo sightings and stories, but there is an event in my past that i think would deffinately qualify, this is the first time i've ever even mentioned it to anyone because of fear of ridicule. one night during the summer of my 3rd grade year, (i was living in vancouver, wa at the time) i went to sleep, it was a normal evening and all was fine until sometime during the middle of the night (possibly 2:00ish) i was abducted by alliens, all i remember was a bright light shining through the slits in the blinds, (couldn't have been a car because there was a large foresty area behind our house that prevented all light from coming through) after that i just have very little memory of what happened to me. anyways, next i knew, i was laying on the couch in the living room (my mom and dad and both my sisters never heard me, it wasn't a large house and my sister would have seen me because had a room just on the other side of the kitchen.) when i woke up, i remember feeling very dizzy and seeing a green and white light, (one of each) through the curtains of the front room window. i have never sleep walked in my life, so we can easily denounce that cause. anyways, when i woke up and saw the light i felt a cold sense of fear come over me, i have no idea what happened but i have no memories of what happened that night and it's kind of frightening. i do have slight glimpses every once in a while, but i'm not certain if i can call these \"memories.\" i see a cold blueish\\white light and i am laying on a table, the aliens speak several words that contain clicking sounds mixed with some other sounds like that of normal human words. i also have a memory of entering into their spacecraft and walking accross the grass in my bare feel and walking up the ramp which was very cold to my feet. the only thing that i took away from this encounter was a arrow-shaped scar on my right middle finger, and a sense of emptyness that i still feel to this day. this incedent psychologically effected me for the rest of my life, wondering what on earth they did to me that night. there was another incedent that could be classified as a sighting. this was in my 9th grade, or 8 possibly around 6-9pm. it was a very large object that flew over my home-town of ocean shores, wa. it was a very thunderous and managed to knock over a few cups in the kitchen, this was also wittnessed by alot of other people in the town. my dad was out getting my sister from some school event when it happened and he heard it and saw it as well. it took a good 2-3 minutes to pass by as it rattled everything in the house. we lived on the lake and i remember seeing the reflection of the object, it was deffinately a triangular object and there were no lights shining off of it, like it didn't want to be seen, if you looked at the sky you probably couldn't make it out but by the reflection on the water i could make it out precisly, oddly it passed directly over my house, the tip of it was almost exactly in line with where i was standing, i'd say it was at least the size of 2 or 3 football fields in length and was putting out a tremendous amount of power, either this was alien or it was a government project, either way it was unidentifiable."],"trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Vancouver","There were no other sightings in Vancouver on or around July 7th 1993"],"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"45.642008","Region":"Washington","Date of the Event":"07/07/1993 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.654296","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"2 events from a while ago","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6395.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6395.html"],"City":"Vancouver","Log Number":"US-02172007-0001","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/07/1993 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.642008,+-122.654296(6395)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6395) map </A>","Case Number":"6395","Disposition":"Unknown"}
