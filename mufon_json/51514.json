I was looking east from chair when one bright orange and white colored orb came down. Then two orange balls went west then 20 min later two more went west slowed down then up and away into west, two at a time. The four had same path and direction, they were silent. lit-up the tree tops, very bright at first. There were lots of people on a porch who saw them too. The dog (Lab) got excited too when they passed by. Wow what did we just see.. could not stabilize pictures on camera as they were going west leaving."],"Log Number":"US-10132013-0014","Longitude":"-74.470042","Latitude":"40.615209"}
