Three to the left and three to the right.Made me wonder at the time if it was two seperate objects or one object.It would probably be about the size of plane and bigger than a helicopter.I have seen lights just like this on UFO shows but always seem to be of another color than what we saw.I was so wraped up in what I was seeing that I never noticed that my wife was seeing it too.Just as it was out of sight my wife. suddenly said \"That was weird\".I told her baby we just saw a UFO.It surprised me that she noticed how unusal it was because she is not the type to reflect on stuff like that.We lived in Loxahatchee fla and our house was directly under the landing pathway to the WPB airport.Always planes flying over our home constantly and we lived there 22 years and seeing planes dayly was a routine thing around our home.I was in the military transportations and was the coxswaine on a Mic 8 landing craft.I was always around planes and boats and ships.I know that planes and boats have port and starboad lights with one blinking or statinary white light.Red is on the left and green is on the right.To this day I still am up set that I did not see the lights on the other side.Will always wonder what color they would have been. I know what I saw and not sure if it was some military secret craft or something from who knows where.Just know it was definitly a UFO. I did not take notice of the day, year or month this happened.Just talked about it over the years with people.Just remember my grandson was maybe 2 or 3 years old and he is 21 now and in the air force.It was probably on a Friday because we were on vacation.This actually happened and I know that these things exsist.Always wondered about this stuff and thought people were probably mistaking stuff.Now I know these things are real.0"],"City":"Tallahassee","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27670.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27670_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27670.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-84.271093"}
