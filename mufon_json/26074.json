We took the exit to Paterson I believe its 155p and suddenly my friend noticed some white light in the sky. Inititially we thought someone is throwing light in the sky or it is related to security lights. But later we saw that there were four white lights each of which was pretty huge in size. These lights would get spread apart from each other an then cluster back together. We drove for around 5 to 6 miles and they were above our car all this time playing in the sky in the same way, spreading apart and then clustering back together. This lasted for almost 15 to 20 minutes until they started fading away. Thanks!"]}
