{"divs":["sighting detailsi'm commenting here after searching the internet after a blue-light phenomenon happened to me at about 8:30 this evening. i was on my out to pick up my girlfriend from work and there was a blizzard happening. i was driving very slowly at about 5 mph and a strange blue light appeared right over my car. i could not explain this light by anything other than a light-blue lightning bolt. it flashed above me and in around my car for about 8 seconds. there was no sound at all. the flashing was very chaotic. i instantly thought that there was something falling out of the sky and was headed directly at me. i stopped the car and actually prepared for an impact of what i quickly thought was either lightning or a crashing plane's light. i thought the latter because i live very close to an airport. as suddenly as the light appeared it had disappeared. i was fortunate enough to have a car about a tenth of a mile facing my direction at the time this happened. i drove up to the street and got out of my car to ask the other driver if he saw anything. the man in the other car said that a saw a very bright flashing light above my car. i asked if he saw the source and he said no. i asked if it was a plane and he said it couldn't have been because it was too low. i also asked if the light appeared as a beam coming down and he said that he just couldn't describe it. this really frustrated me because of his distance would have given him a much better perspective of the event. it was difficult for him to truly describe the source of the light because of the poor visibility through the blowing snow. he also seemed confused and freaked out by the event and didn't seem willing to continue the conversation. he did ask me jokingly if i had though it was a dream i was having. i simply said yes. he said that i shouldn't worry because he saw it too. i walked away from him saying \"[cms\\tg\\pd]\" over and over again. i was freaked out! the light seemed electric. i cant really describe it any other way. it was as if there was a ball of blue electricity right above my car. the event happened at [cms\\tg\\pid]. if you are to google map this address the red pointer will fall on the exact place where the event took place."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20927.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20927.html"],"Weather Factors":"Snow","City":"Rockford","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12092009-0001","Summary":"Strange blue light flashes above my car!","Longitude":"-89.085495","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"12/08/2009 08:30 UTC","Latitude":"42.277431","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"20927","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.277431,+-89.085495(20927)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20927) map </A>","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Rockford","There were no other sightings in Rockford on or around December 8th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"12/09/2009 12:03 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois"}
