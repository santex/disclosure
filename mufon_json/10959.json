(if i had held a quarter out at arm���s length, it would have covered both lights.) the lights stayed in one place for perhaps 2 to 3 seconds, then moved slowly, horizontally, and at almost a right angle to their previous path, toward the northeast, out over the ocean. the red light was definitely in front of the intense, smaller white one, and there was a slight distance between them, but it seemed to me that both lights were on the same object. after another 12 to 15 seconds, both lights suddenly went out, and i saw no more of them, nor was there anything else in the vicinity of that sort. they did not simply dwindle into the distance; they went out while they were still quite visible in the darkness over the ocean. i did not hear any sounds which appeared to be connected to the lights. after a few minutes, i went down from the roof of the building, as i was already somewhat later than usual. i told my mother about this at the time; she said that i must have seen \"some kind of military aircraft,\" which i doubted, but i did not mention it to anyone else, or try to report it. there were indeed two large military bases within 40 miles of my location, but i had frequently seen and heard assorted military aircraft, none of which had behaved in that way. shortly after this incident, security concerns caused the owners of the building to lock the roof, so i was no longer able to watch the evenings from there, and within a year i had moved away from the area. i have seldom mentioned this to anyone, and have never attempted to report it to any other organization."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-66.047222","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=18.440833,+-66.047222(10959)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10959) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"PR-05302008-0004","Country":"Puerto Rico"}
