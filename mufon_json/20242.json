I was listening to music when i looked out my window and saw three flashing ovals with a red glow around them. I left my room after looking at the clock on my counter which read 3:26. I went outside and the lights were still there. occasionally they would flicker and the red glow would seem to get brighter or dimmer. At first, I thought i was some kids with flashlights, because they seemed to be moving in circular patterns. I then saw them get smaller and ascend up until i could not see them anymore. i felt kind of scared at the sight of what i saw. when i woke up from sleeping that day, i just wanted to convince myself that i dreamt it, but i can't deny what i saw. i haven't told anyone besides my friend. i explained it to him over an online chat today. i'm afraid my parents won't understand."],"Latitude":"39.988311","Summary":"I saw three flashing white lights with a red glow moving in circular patterns above my neighborhood.","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Carmel","There were no other sightings in Carmel on or around November 1st 2009"],"Date of the Event":"11/01/2009 03:26 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
