I was thinking it might possibly be Venus and right while I was looking directly at it the thing pulsates once and vanishes without a trace. Gone. Like it had never been, while I was looking directly at it. I have no explanation and there were no clouds nearby. I saw something vanish while I was looking directly at it wondering if it might be Venus! It was freaky."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere","Date Submitted":"10/01/2013 08:24 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/30/2013 06:55 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Richboro","Latitude":"40.21787","Log Number":"US-10012013-0008","Summary":"It was a very bright star until it pulsates and vanishes right in front of me.","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-75.062066","Case Number":"51234","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51234.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51234.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.21787,+-75.062066(51234)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51234) map </A>"}
