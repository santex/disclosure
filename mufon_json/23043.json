I AM A LITTLE STREESED OUT AND WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE. THE SIGHTINGS BEGAN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH AND HAVE NOT STOPPED. I WISH SOMEONE COULD REACH OUT AND TELL ME WHAT TO DO WITH THIS. I HAVE TAKEN MANY PICS AND VIDEO WITH MY CELL PHONE AND A CAMERA, WHICH I PLAN ON GETTING DEVELOPED.
