It was about 8:56 p.m. As we were walking, something grabbed our attention in the sky. We saw a gray UFO shaped disc with 3 lights, flickering. The UFO object moved from left to right in a straight position. Then it hovered down and disappeared. When we saw the object, we knew it wasn't an airplane. An airplane can't be a disc shaped object. We felt scared when we first saw it. We stood still to see where it might go. After that we didn't see it."]}
