It was a clear night and I had just left Fred Meyers store at about 8:30 pm. As I was driving up Central Ave. toward Ocean Blvd. I thought I saw at the top of Central and Ocean a green light over the flashing yellow light. My first thought was oh no they didn���t put a stop light up here! But as I got closer I realized that the light (the same color as a green traffic light) was bigger and higher up then the flashing yellow light. It looked like it it was behind the Methodist church where there are big power lines. It wasn���t like a regular green light because the light glowed and moved around, like millions of fireflies. Now my curiosity as to what I was looking at kept me driving toward it. Just as I realized what I thought it was there was a flash and it shot straight up in the sky leaving a yellow trail of something that had been shot out of it. I was so shocked at what I saw! You hear about them but you never plan on seeing one. Total time from seeing it to it vanishing was about 30 to 45 sec. I went home as scheduled and told my children who believed my story. I didn���t give it much thought after that. A week later on 11-07-2010 I had just gotten out of my car from work at my apartment and again it was around 8:30 pm when for some reason I looked up over my apartment. It was again a clear night when I saw a white star move. I continued to look at this ���star��� which as high as it was I figured it was over Empire Lakes which is behind my apartment building complex. As I continued to watch the star it started to glow bright white and get larger. Then it shot off north leaving again a yellowish trail behind it shooting south. I was not surprised but full of dread this time for some reason. This also took about 30 to 45 secs. Again I went in and told the kids that I just saw another one. Again they believed me. The only thing that really makes all of this weird is that two days later I woke up at 10:00 am. Everyone in the apartment, including the cats were still asleep. I found this odd as my 9 year old granddaughter who slept with me at the time is usually up at the crack of dawn. My cat Yuki cries at the door at 9:00 am every morning like clockwork to be fed. I was the only person awake. Gradually, everyone was up and about and seemed sluggish. I discovered that I didn���t feel well, had a headache and my throat and windpipe were extremely dry, bone dry. My lymph nodes in my throat were swelled up to bursting and I had three horizontal cuts on the bottom right inside of my mouth. I felt like this for about five days. I didn���t get checked out by a doctor as I didn���t have any health insurance at the time. I do have an appointment in March and I will ask the doctor to check out the marks in my mouth. Previously in 2003 to 2004 I had lived off Seven Devils Road in a secluded spot on the ocean on Tokyo Lane. I didn���t write down exact times of the things that happen to me while the kids and I lived there. I was constantly plagued by the Coast Guard helicopter flying directly and very close to my house at 2 or 3:00 in the morning several times a month. When I say close I mean just over my roof top! I thought that they may be rescuing someone but there were never any reports of vessels needing assistance and they weren���t near the water. One time I woke up to what I thought was a spot light over the house and thinking the Coast Guard was at it again. I got up out of bed to flip them off. Just as my feet hit the floor I heard the Coast Guard coming!? The light went out and I got back into bed terrified. I heard the Coast Guard once again fly as fast as they could southeast toward Bandon away from the water. I woke up one time with every joint in my body on fire. When I say joint I mean every place that a bone connects to another bone. It was so painful I couldn't move. This lasted for about 20 min. and then the pain faded away. It was an uncomfortable feeling living there and night time was always stressful. I was fatigued all the time, the children said they felt like they were being watched. We left in 02-2004 and the children and I were grateful to leave and move back into town. Apparently, it doesn���t matter where you live. I have shared this with very few people. My friend in California believes my stories and is greatly concerned. Hopefully, this will help and in some way be another piece of the puzzle."],"Source":"MUFON"}
