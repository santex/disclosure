{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsHey, This event just happened. I went outside to try and catch our bird which flew out of its cage and into a tree. As soon as we got out i saw a HUGE light fall from the sky and it reached the ground before vanishing. I thought it was a meteor or something until i noticed another light in the distance. I thought it was a really bright star or something. About 5 minutes later i noticed that the light moved about 1cm to the left. I wasn't paying full attention to it as i was trying to get my bird down. Finally about 15 minutes later, I saw the light has moved backwards. I decided to walk out the front to see it. When i got out the front the light was gone. It wasn't cloudy or anything."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22817.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22817.html"],"Country":"Australia","Date of the Event":"04/14/2010 06:15 UTC","Log Number":"AU-04142010-0008","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Brisbane","There were no other sightings in Brisbane on or around April 14th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/14/2010 04:44 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-27.465653,+153.024712(22817)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22817) map </A>","Tags":"City","Case Number":"22817","Latitude":"-27.465653","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"153.024712","City":"Brisbane","Summary":"Massive Meteor Light Falling Then huge light in sky for 10 mintutes moving around.","Region":"Queensland"}
