The sky had a unique look to in, the clouds seemed to make a right angle in the sky. I noticed a dim glow behind the clouds. I just happened to catch it moving across the sky. The UFO's were small orbs with a halo around them. Im assuming this is due them being behind the clouds. The numerous UFO's flew threw the sky changing drastic direction and speed. I have seen airplanes and choppers and this was obviously not that. THe speed and change in direction was unlike anything Ive ever seen. The UFOs would fly only in the clouds that made the right angle, and once they finished making the attitude changes they shoot north along the clouds and disappeared. The ships seemed to apear in the same general location, the elbow of the \"right angle\". At one point I counted 10 orbs flying around each other in the same location and they all flew off to the north."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45605.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/06/2013 08:55 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
