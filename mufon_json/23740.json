{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas a very clear night sky, what is a kind of rare in S���o Paulo, and I was looking through my window to the city as a whole (I live on the 23rd floor, in downtown area and I have a wide and privileged view of the city from here) then this thing crossed the sky in an incredible speed! I've seen meteors on the past, and I'm sure this was not a meteor or an asteroid at all... meteors behave different, because when they appear looks like thick and disappear thin, you know, but this thing was very uniform on its trajectory, and on my field of view, from the top of my window to the horizon it took less than a second. A very uniform thick risk on the sky on a tremendous velocity! It came from the north to south. Could you guys please tell me, what was that? Is there any other report about it?
