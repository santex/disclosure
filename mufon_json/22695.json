I had taken photos with planes in them and we have a small airport in town which i live next to and know what planes look like on film. The photo I am uploading has been cropped. No other editing has been done. What I saw was a fast moving light very small it moved in a straight line with slight spinning motions like a corkscrew. It was very fast and barley caught my eye. luckily I had my camera pointed in the same direction and right after the click I previewed glad to see a tiny line when I full zoomed."]}
