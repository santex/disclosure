It was flying lower than any airplane I have ever seen and I couldsee it very clearly. It had rectangular 22bumps 22 on it and didnt make asound. I was excited and wanted to get out of my car and get other people tolook but I would have been too embarrassed. The object never did anythingspecial and continued to fly in a straight path until I could no longer see it(it was so low that a 1 story building blocked sight of it). I told my familyabout it but havent told anyone else until now."],"Latitude":"42.638922","City":"Pontiac","Summary":"daytime sighting of flying object","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.638922,+-83.291047(781)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (781) map </A>","Region":"Michigan","Date Submitted":"05/31/2000 06:40 UTC","Case Number":"781","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/781.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/781.html"]}
