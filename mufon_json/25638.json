{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was camping out in the blue mountains west of Sydney N.S.W with my two brothers. We were lying in our sleeping bags looking up at the stars , when i noticed something strange. Very high up in the sky , looking like one of the stars was a red glowing circular object . At first it was stationary , but then all of a sudden it took off across the sky at an unbelievable speed and just stopped instantly . At first i said nothing to my brothers just incase i was imagining things , but the object just kept zipping around the sky so i pointed out what i was witnessing . First jeff noticed then anthony , we could not believe what we were seeing with our eyes . This red light was moving so fast that it was , at times hard to keep up with it. Within 5 mins of watching. another two glowing objects , one glowing green and one glowing a kind of yellow appeared out of nowhere and began to dart around the sky around the first red light . The entire event lasted up to 20 mins , but the last two lights were only visible for the last 5 minutes or so . The strange thing was that they seemed to be trying to chase or scare away the red light and it worked because all 3 lights just simply took off at a crazy speed and were all instantly gone , just like that . To this day whenever we all catch up , that event always comes up in conversation and still amazes and confuses us to this day . How could anything travel that fast , come to a complete stop with no inertia at all , then take off at a completely different angle at a phenomenal speed without being held to the laws of our physics ?"],"Date Submitted":"10/01/2010 06:42 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"AU-10012010-0008","Object Features":"None, Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-33.867531,+151.21009(25638)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25638) map </A>","Summary":"3 glowing coloured star like objects","Case Number":"25638","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New South Wales","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25638.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25638.html"],"Country":"Australia","Latitude":"-33.867531","Date of the Event":"11/30/1992 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Sydney","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Sydney","There were no other sightings in Sydney on or around November 30th 1992"],"Longitude":"151.21009"}
