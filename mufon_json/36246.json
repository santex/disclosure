{"divs":["Sighting DetailsViewed 5 total red lights in the sky over the St. Paul Como Park area. Squeezing in a quick smoke break at work and noticed 3 lights as bright as a stop light positioned almost like a single plane, moving NE to SW. Two of the three lights seperatly altered course and then seemed to move back into a flight pattern. After a few minutes I had noticed that 2 more red lights were following. I work for a pizza delivery chain and had asked 4 co-workers passing by what their thoughts were and noone was able to fully explain what we were watching. The international airport is near, so we get to see planes at all altitudes. While the red lights were flying over we were able to watch a low flying plane and a crusing altitude plane fly over. Myself and two co-workers watched in a clear night sky as one by one each flying light instantly changed course. They appeared to turn almost straight out to space and slightly NW at a very quick speed. A plane at about 30,000 feet moving West across the sky, lights flashing in a distance but clearing moving around the earth was passing during this time. Each red light grew smaller quickly untell the dissipeared into space. There were sounds from the low flying plane passing by however no sounds produced by the red lights."],"trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in St Paul","There were no other sightings in St Paul on or around February 3rd 2012"],"Object Features":"None","Region":"Minnesota","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.960334,+-93.161264(36246)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36246) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.161264","Date Submitted":"03/04/2012 06:08 UTC","Case Number":"36246","Country":"United States","City":"St Paul","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03042012-0011","Latitude":"44.960334","Sighting Duration":"00:12:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36246.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36246.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"02/03/2012 07:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Viewed 5 red lights in the sky over the St. Paul Como Park area."}
