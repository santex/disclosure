but being a doctor straight from the books there was no convincing her otherwise and she put me on an antidepressant only to find that it induced depression (never before had i ever experienced depression) so i stopped taking the meds and regained my former healthy mind. ten years later one can only wonder, due to the similarities, that these two incidences are in some way connected."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01142012-0010","Longitude":"-80.663499","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"34851","City":"Melbourne","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/16/2010 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34851.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34851.html"]}
