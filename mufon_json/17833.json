Immediately, I noticed a circular, dim, shadowy sphere - about the same size as the sun, from that distance - moving through the clouds Northeast. I looked around and also saw several airplanes and birds, but none were that high and none looked spherical in nature. I caught the attention of my friend and tried to get her to see what I was seeing, but she couldn't find what I was looking at. I followed it through the clouds - for about 30 seconds - and just when the clouds broke and the object should have appeared, it simply was just not visible any longer. I was incredibly intrigued and excited, as it was definitely one of those moments that is truly perplexing. I knew I was seeing something that I've never seen before."],"Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Windy, Medium","City":"Sea Bright","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/05/2009 04:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17833.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17833.html"],"Summary":"Dim, shadowy circle moving through clouds.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.361499,+-73.974026(17833)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17833) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"New Jersey","Log Number":"US-07052009-0037","Longitude":"-73.974026","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/05/2009 04:30 UTC"}
