I looked up to see a jet and it's usual line of smoke that follows, but a round, silver circular ball was hovering just under the trail of smoke. I kept watching it trying to figure out what it was, but had to look at the road to turn in a westerly direction. I went to grab my phone, but when I looked back up, the ball was gone. I told myself I must've seen a reflection of some sort, but then caught sight of a blinking round ball moving quickly in a westerly direction ahead of me. It looked like a star does when twinkling at night. I tried to keep my eyes on it but it was moving very fast and I couldn't see it anymore. I counted 6 jets in the sky at that time, all with the smoke trailing behind them, but no sight of the object I saw earlier."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-97.087207","Case Number":"34695","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oklahoma","Date of the Event":"01/06/2012 05:50 UTC","Summary":"saw round reflective ball near tail of smoke from jet, when jet moved East ball moved quickly west, blinked like a star, disappeared from sight","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34695.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34695.html"],"Country":"United States","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"01/07/2012 06:33 UTC"}
