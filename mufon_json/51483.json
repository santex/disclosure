When out of the corner of my eye, I saw a big, bright reddish orange pulsating orb slowly moving north. I watched it for about 4 min. In awe. Then, ran in the house to get my husband. But, by the time he came out, it was gone. It was low, big and looked like a ball of plasma. A mini sun. Way cool. Did not have camera with me. Sure, did not expect to see that."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51483.html"],"trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Westland","There were no other sightings in Westland on or around October 11th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-10122013-0008","Date of the Event":"10/11/2013 12:00 UTC","City":"Westland","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Other","Longitude":"-83.4123","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Fireball","Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"51483","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/12/2013 03:48 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.281822,+-83.4123(51483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51483) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
