{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMe located in Romaland, CA going into work. I always look in the sky early morning on my way to work tolook at stars and planets, this is how I noticed this strange occurrence. Thoug it might be a comet but I wasn't aware of any that would be seen this time of year. Comet like thing in sky moving in a eastern direction about 6:30 am PST and faded away after about 5 minutes or so. It had sort of a round head with a comet like tail but the tail was real short and it just didn't move like a comet but maintained a steady direction. A few minutes later There were Jetstreams all around going toward the same direction like planes were looking or follwing after the object. Saw two other round shiny globelike objects apear and disappear twice after the planes went by. Shortly after another plane came by. I just felt like somthing strange is going on like a UFO or some sort of rocket or missile might have been fired."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Looked like a comet but traveled differently than a comet","City":"Romoland","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"11/05/2007 06:45 UTC","Region":"California","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.745853,+-117.175034(8280)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8280) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.175034","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-11052007-0002","Date Submitted":"11/05/2007 06:45 UTC","Latitude":"33.745853","Case Number":"8280","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Romoland","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8280.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8280.html"],"Object Shape":"Other"}
