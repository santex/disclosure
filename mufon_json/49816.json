I was smoking a cigarette on my way back home at around 9:30 PM. I looked up slowly when i noticed a bright light in the sky. At first i thought shooting star but it was moving far too slow. I squinted to see better and noticed it was 3 white lights flashing in a triangular formation. Traffic was really low at the time but i still couldnt hear the object emitting any noise at all. I couldnt see an outline either. It was moving from East to West in a perfect straight line. Had to be at least a mile up. Ive never been a firm believer of UFOs or aliens but this has made me want to look into it further. I hope others have experienced this as well"],"trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Taylor","There were no other sightings in Taylor on or around August 13th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Michigan","City":"Taylor","Latitude":"42.258362","Summary":"Flasing white lights in triangle formation","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-08142013-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.258362,+-83.233665(49816)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49816) map </A>","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49816.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49816.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
