I spotted a bright star like object moving from west to east in a straight line. There was no noise and no blinking aircraft lights. It kept moving at a slow but steady pace until it disappeared behind some clouds. I noticed that it was lower than the stars but higher than the clouds. The size from my perspective was about a bb held from arms length. The color was like a bright white glowing color, like the headlight of a car."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"04/20/2011 10:31 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"28731","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28731.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28731.html"],"City":"Mishicot"}
