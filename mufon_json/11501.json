When I noticed it was moving I then thought, thats a big plane. Then as it was ascending to what appeared to be space I was in awe. I followed the object as it appeared to turn into a satellite. I followed its path as if it were a satellite until I was no longer able to track it with my naked eye. Thinking back it was pretty graceful and it must have been going very fast. The thing that got me the most which thinking back kinda excludes a helicopter or plane is that I've watched satellites moving in orbit before and that is exactly how the object moved at the end of my viewing. If I had to estimate it must have been no longer than 14 secs for the entire viewing. There were two other planes across the sky I noticed after my viewing. They had red flashing lights."],"Tags":"City","City":"London","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.984078,+-81.242918(11501)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11501) map </A>","Region":"Ontario","Country":"Canada","Latitude":"42.984078","Log Number":"CA-07102008-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/09/2008 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-81.242918","Summary":"Strange ascending object viewed as it turned into what appeared a satellite.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11501.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11501.html"],"Case Number":"11501"}
