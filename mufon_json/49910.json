We first seen one on aug 3rd with the same orangish red pulsating orb large we watched as 4 smaller red orbs appeared randomly around te larger orb..tonight was similar to the large orb we seen few weeks back we spotted it while driving onbendix rd by the air port and we both knew it wasn't a plane because it was redish glowing.my boyfriend seems scared since the laft ufo\"s we seen but I am much more curious as to know what's goin on with these ufo's we have seen..so I told him to go down te road more so we could get to a darker area without streetlights and carlights..we stoped at a graveyard and watched as the light slowly would go up into the air a little and than would slowly come back down ...the light was moving farther away from us as we started heading down a country road to get abetter look..I seen several other lights while we parked by a cornfield but as they got closer we realized they were just planes.the redish orange light we followeed and observed for so long however was not a plane..we both agree we have been lucky and also scared to expierance these sightings recently."]}
