(i printed a color copy of the volcano which just shows the left edge of the remaing cloud.)at 1039 it also vanished. at 1455 the same day,i returned to the volcanocam. a similar-to-earlier, small, white cloud hovered above the earlier spot. i made a color copy of the computer image which shows the left end, only, of the new cloud. don m. johnson p.s. a year ago while driving in ventura, i stopped at a traffic light. i was facing the ocean a little over a mile away. a brisk on-shore breeze swiftly bore a low-level-blanket of small cumulous clouds inland. but i noticed a small, but dense white cloud that hovered statically over the beach, while the other clouds raced around it. the scenario did not change as i drove toward the beach for several blocks and turned away. dmj"],"Log Number":"US-09082008-0008","Object Shape":"Blimp, Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"12392","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.05574,+-122.305199(12392)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12392) map </A>","Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","City":"Cougar","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-122.305199","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"46.05574","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"09/07/2008 10:25 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Cougar","There were no other sightings in Cougar on or around September 7th 2008"]}
