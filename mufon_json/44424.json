{"Summary":"(GS) 2 lights, east sky","Latitude":"39.532273","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"44424","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsWent out onto my balcony to smoke with my girlfriend, just after dark at about 5:40pm in Reno, NV. Noticed two white-yellow lights, larger than any of the stars or planets in sky around them, that were out of place in the sky (I look at the stars every night). I was then shocked to see them move at a very high speed from the east to the northeast, flying in almost a diagonal formation. Asked girlfriend if she saw it and I wasnt crazy and she said that she was definitely seeing the same exact thing. As we were watching, the lights crossed the sky, then disappeared to nothing in seconds in the northeast sky, right in front of our eyes, and never came back. There were no clouds and there were two airplanes and several stars in the same area that remained visible. Both my girlfriend and I were totally freaked out by this, had goosebumps and decided to go back inside. The lights were constant until they disappeared, fading from being way brighter than Venus to nothing in about five seconds. At first I thought they were stars but immediately realized they were much larger and brighter, and were also moving in a way that no star would."],"City":"Reno","Region":"Nevada","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/09/2012 03:47 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.532273,+-119.808833(44424)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44424) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44424.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44424.html"],"Log Number":"US-12092012-0012","Date of the Event":"12/08/2012 05:39 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Reno","There were no other sightings in Reno on or around December 8th 2012"],"Longitude":"-119.808833"}
