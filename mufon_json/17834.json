The craft was moving at a steady speed but made no noise at all, at first we thought it was a helicopter but no other lights were visible just the one on the nose. The object appeared to be round or oval. The craft was going from the north heading south and which it then made a right turn and began heading west. We were able to watch it for about 30 more seconds and then it never reappeared past some small wispy clouds. My friends and family were all talking about what happened and wondered what we had just seen. 15 to 20 minutes later a second object did the exact same thing. It was almost like watching a rerun of the first sighting except the light on the nose seemed to be pulsing dimmer then brighter. The light was not flashing like a beacon or strobe just going brighter then dimmer. Once the craft turned west we were able to watch it for another 15 to 20 seconds until it simply dissappeared."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Indiana"}
