Then it started moving upward and out of vision or sight. My daughter also saw it because she looked up to the sky when I did to see what I was looking up at. (I really don't know what the distance was - that the object was up in the sky). It did not take more than 20 to 25 secound for this to happen. We just sat their for a few moments because we were so startled and shocked."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/14/2007 10:26 UTC","Log Number":"US-05152007-0002","Disposition":"Unknown"}
