I saw a large red fireball moving slowly from the north to south. The fireball was very red in color, was at about 45 degrees up, and did not change course or speed. It took approximately one minute for the fireball to move across the sky until it was too small to see. I thought then that it appeared to be something coming into the atmosphere from space, maybe space junk or a meteor, etc. I have seen large meteors before, but I have never seen any that were red or lasted this long, or moved this slowly. About 10 minutes later I was looking at the north sky and noticed another red fireball traveling in the same direction and speed as the first one. This fireball seemed to be slightly larger than the first, and you could see a faint blur behind this fireball ��� almost a very short tail. We watched this fireball for about 90 seconds before it was too small to see in the southern sky. When I saw the first fireball, I thought that it was a meteor, etc. but after seeing a second large fireball I was unsure. These were very large fireballs. I did search the area newspapers during the next week, but did not find any articles about fireballs in the sky."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball"}
