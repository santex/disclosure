It was about 11: 47pm and i was talking to my friend out side of work, when another coworker runs to us and say: LOOK!!!! LOOK!! ... i turned around and maybe 1000ft away (very close) i see the object as big as 4 SUV parked side by side (sorry didn't know what to compare it to) with random flashing green, red, orange on exterior coming down in vertical movement but very slow. Then it speed up coming down very fast maybe 1.5 miles in less than second, then POOF!!! a little bright flash and it was gone. The whole thing took a little less than 11 sec. I stood there for 10 mins waiting and praying that it will show up again, but nothing. I hope other people saw the same thing or maybe even more.
