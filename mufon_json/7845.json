luke who was with glen ran back around and jumped in the truck.i just stared at it in amazement knowing it was not something i would probably never see again and was just memorized by the power i felt coming from the ground into feet going clear my head as this object just set there giving off,'the only way i can explain it' an electrical pulsation of raw power with a dull hum that lowered & raised. the closest i can explain the sound and the body vibes would be like having 6 big block chevy motors all camed to hell with mufflers on them,all in tune,and slowed down to almost a stull out. the hair was litterally just standing up on my arms like static electricity was running through me. the object was sort of egg shaped only stretched a little longer in the center.it had a windshield that was facing us about halfway up from the center and rolled up alittle passed the top and around the edges,and this is where the light was com'ing from. i'm not exagerating one bit when i say it was as bright as a full sun reflecting from solid chrome when you looked into it and could see what i guess was the ceiling,but the weird thing about it was it did not actually hurt your eyes or blind spot you at all from seeing the detail of the object from the clear star filled night.we could still make out the dull silver color of it and i could see a very small wing slanting back near the front and center of it that stuck out about 3 foot and had a sharp point com'ing straight back off of that. the width of the ship was,approx.8 to 9 foot wide,at its thickest in the center,and approx. 20 to 24 foot long. if i would have had a solftball i could have under hand pitched it and hit the thing. for a couple minutes we watched it hover there and then glen said i'm out'a here man and he jumped in the truck and took off. at this time the thing started to turn at a right angle towards us while still just hovering above the pine tree. i wanted to stay and watch it but barry said let's get the hell out'a here and jumped in on the drivers side where i had left the door open and the motor running,yes the engine was still running and the object did not have any effect on the car or truck engine or lighting systems. i told barry if the dang thing wanted us it would have already had us but he proceeded to put the car in gear and pull out from sitting in the middle of the seat and actually making me run along with the car while holding onto the door and jump in.i started to drive from this point and he was hollaring step on it but i tried to see if i could see it out of my drivers window when barry said it was above us in the front. as i looked up from the front windshield it angled again alittle to the left and then like something out'a star wars it gave off a loud shreaking sound and took off faster than anything you could imagine,i mean if you could actually see a bullet that is what it looked like and the wild'est thing of all was it left a stream of multicolor blue streaks equal on both side of it that just slowly faded away to nothing but the star filled sky. i've tried to talk about this to barry over the years but he just says i don't know what the hell it was and i don't want to know what the hell it was i don't see glenn to often but did mention it to him about 2 months ago and asked if he remembered that night and he said hell yea,i can't forget that one. we talked about it for awhile and both wondered if anyone else had seen it that night so i'm finally telling about what we saw and if anyone else out there saw this we'd sure like to know. also in the mid-to late 80's has anyone ever seen a v-winged object about about the width of a football field with dull blue blinking light running the full width acrossed the front in the emmitsburg & fairfield area of zora? i saw this critter one evening around 10 pm coming up from the emmitsburg md. area flying slow & low and not a sound one coming from it.i know the goverment knows about this one and ain't said a thing about it. it came almost up to the house i lived in at the time at ranch trail in carroll valley and made a sharp southern turn acrossed the corrie and about a minute and a 1\\2 later two huge military cargo type planes came from the same direction flying real low and the first one went straight on heading east towards site-r a goverment installation and the second one veered off north at the ski liberty mountain resort standing completly on its side below the treetops and circled the complete mountain,came back around the same way heading north,but never came full circle again?? got out foxed again didn't ya' sam??"],"Date of the Event":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Fairfield","Summary":"sorta egg shaped,super bright interior,hair standing electrical pulsating emmited,speed beyond belief","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/05/2007 03:12 UTC","Object Features":"Window(s), Wings","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.368598","Latitude":"39.787317"}
