It was in the eastern sky after the sun set at about 70 degrees. I didn't expect anything but it suddenly started to descend. I ran inside to grab the camcorder and managed to get very little of its descent, as by that time it was fading as it seemed to get further away as though it was moving to the southeast. Shortly after, about 3 minutes, there was what looked like a meteor traveling the same southeast direction (about 1 second with a very short trail) but at a very low altitude (lower than the orb)."],"trends":["There have been 53 other sightings in Rochester","There was one other sighting in Rochester on or around August 30th 2011"],"Summary":"Large star-like orb seen for 2 nights suddenly descended then faded towards the southeast","Date of the Event":"08/30/2011 08:40 UTC","Region":"New York","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Rochester","Latitude":"43.114924","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"31335"}
