The camera was aimed at a cloud formation, When you see an object fly by at the top of the screen, It was noticed only later while watching the video. I didnt take this video my coworker did and he never noticed this until I pointed it out to him. Another Jet? Missile? Rocket? In either case it looks like its moving pretty good notice that after he pans back with the camera the object and its trail is totally gone."],"City":"Cypress","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21882.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21882.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Log Number":"US-02132010-0014","Longitude":"-118.031835","Summary":"Interesting Video","Object Features":"None, Unknown"}
