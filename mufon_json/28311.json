{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn July of 1998 I was visiting my aunt in Dallas, Texas with my wife, 5 year old son and my mother. We were driving to the Alamo in San Antonio for an outing with my aunt sitting next to me, and my wife, mom and son in the back. Half way there, my son needed to make a pit stop. We pulled over on the side of the road and I took him a bit into the woods to pee. After he was done we were making our way back to the van when I caught a strong smell of a sweet, cinnamon-like scent. I immediately froze and instantly had a recollection or flashback of an incident that was too realistic to be a dream. Images flashed back of when I was back in the mother land (somewhere in Central America). I was about 5 years old and I was playing hide and seek outside at night with my older brother and grandfather. The area where we used to live was next to the woods which stretched a long way. I used to squeeze between the barbed wire fence to hide deeper so they wouldn���t find me. As I was hiding behind a tree I suddenly saw a translucent soft blue light behind me. As I stood up I could see my shadow in front of me against the tree and the light engulfed me. It felt like I was floating in Jell-O. I remember someone helping me into a chair with what felt like seatbelts. I remember going straight up and feeling weightless. I was inside a clear bubble looking down at the land. I could see and hear my brother and grandfather shouting for me. I kept screaming ���I am up here��� but they could not hear me. I felt the sensation of rocking back-and-forth like in a rocking chair. I was able to see the rooftops of all the houses and buildings nearby. I could feel the presence of someone next to me but I could not turn my head to look. I felt hands on my shoulders holding me down. A few minutes later I closed my eyes as I felt the sensation of falling down which made me pee on my pants. I opened my eyes and was back behind the tree I was hiding. The whole incident could not have been more than a few minutes. When I went inside my house I got the beating of my life for disappearing and peeing on my pants. They told me they had been looking for me for almost two hours. I told everyone about my ordeal but they did not believe me. I even drew pictures of the seat and bubble I was in. I could not read yet so I drew letters of what I saw on top of the corrugated steel roof tops of some of the buildings ���BOLANOS.��� My son and I got back in the van and started to drive off. I told my aunt (who is only 2 years older than me, I���m 49 now) what just had happened to me. She kept quiet for a while and eventually told me she had had similar experiences and never told anyone. Unlike me she has remembered all along. To this day at times we can both predict near future events like de ja vous. As we kept driving to the Alamo, we both predicted there would be a red Kenworth 18-wheeled truck with the letters ���Pinto��� on the side, and that it would be on the side of the road with the back wheels on fire. Thirteen years later (today) and my wife still insists it was a prank we played on her and my mom."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28311.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Region":"North Carolina","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"Total recall, flashback, recollection","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Unknown","There were no other sightings in Unknown on or around October 1st 1966"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.498316,+-81.998659(28311)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28311) map </A>","Log Number":"SV-03192011-0024","Date of the Event":"10/01/1966 08:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Unknown","Case Number":"28311","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"01:30:00","Longitude":"-81.998659","Date Submitted":"03/19/2011 07:10 UTC","Latitude":"35.498316","Source":"MUFON"}
