{"Country":"United States","Case Number":"43613","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMemorial day 2009 at 9:00pm (or shortly past) my wife and I were in the driveway and noticed five red-orange balls (orbs) traveling south at tree-top level, we were standing to there west, approx. a mile away, the best I could tell they traveled south for approx. a mile or so then just began going east without turning, it was a 90 degree redirection not a turn. Three of them in front side by side with one to their rear maybe one-eighth of a mile and another behind that one,the same distance. What through me was when they began going east the three in front went from side by side to three in a row, there were no turns just abrupt change of direction. And they continued east until they were out of site. Also note that my neighbors were outside and saw them as well, I heard one yell \"look U.F.O.s\". That reasured me that I was'nt seeing things. I just thought someone should know what I seen, and if you have reports from this date I would like to see them, I would love to know where they were going and what they were doing here."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.275624,+-86.128742(43613)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43613) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43613.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43613.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.128742","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"Five red-orange orbs traveled N. to S. then 90 degree turn to east and out of sight.","Log Number":"US-10302012-0009","Date of the Event":"05/31/2009 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"40.275624","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"10/30/2012 04:05 UTC"}
