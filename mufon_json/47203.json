We started wrapping up our night hanging out as we are talking I look up to stare at the stars and point out what appeared to be a cluster of stars around the North Star as we are watching the stars they start to move at first I thought it was just me but he then says whoa are you seeing this. We watched as they moved from below the North Star by a considerable amount to on top of it so that it looked like one was on top of the other then they ascended to the top left and slowly faded out of sight. They appeared to be four prominent ones that held a pattern looked like stars reddish glow. Appeared in a tall rectangle pattern two up top two at bottom. But almost seemed like there could be more just very faintly visible . They moved in a steady pace not fast but steady could not be confused with a plane or blimp or anything I have ever seen."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Lauderhill","Date of the Event":"05/05/2013 09:56 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"47203","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/05/2013 11:36 UTC","Summary":"Looking up at the brightest star in sky 4star like objects appeared slowly moving across the sky.
