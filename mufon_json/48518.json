Not unusual because mccarren airport is nearby. Pulled into apartment parking lot and thought why is this plane not out of sight it is moving too slow. Then I realised it wasn't moving forward at all. It was hovering over the complex. It looked like suspended in time or frozen in place but I could still hear the engine. Sounded like a normal plane. So I just stopped driving in the middle of the parking lot and a few seconds later it started to move forward again at normal speed. I parked my car real fast and walked back around the building and it was gone! I have a clear view all the way to the strip but it was just vanished within 30 seconds.."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
