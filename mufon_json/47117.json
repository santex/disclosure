I thought it might be an airplane because of the blinking lights, but upon looking at it for a while I knew it was something else. It stayed in the same general spot in the Northeast, moving lightly to the right as minutes went by. The colors switched in and out of blue, red, and white. I might have thought it was a star or a planet had I not known any better. Both Jupiter and Sirius were in the sky and probably the only things close to being as bright, but that's not what I was looking at. I felt confused because I'm used to looking up at the sky and knowing what I see. Whatever this was was something I hadn't seen before. I lost sight of the object when my ride arrived."],"Log Number":"US-05022013-0006","Date of the Event":"05/01/2013 09:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.61851,+-81.358261(47117)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47117) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Longitude":"-81.358261","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"It blinked red, white, and blue.
