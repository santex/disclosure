My sister and I both witnessed it above mission bay in San Diego. there where 3 to 4 short cone shaped UFOs. It was 6:30 pm dark out, they gave off a yellow light. They where arranged in a perfect diagonal line fading to black one at a time and then relighting again. Never seen anything like it in the sky before!! I was in front of my apartment complex that overlooks the bay. I just noticed it out of the corner of my eye, there where traffic helicopters and airplanes in the sky as well. When I first noticed it I said \"what is that?\" to my sister, she then saw it too and could not explain what it was. We where both left in awe."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/27/2008 06:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Cone","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
