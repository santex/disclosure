It was to weird, it was to close to the helicopter to be another helicopter with it. It look like just a light and it was right off the nose atone point to close to be another helicopter. I dont know what i saw im a skeptic it might of been a drone or somthing but this wasnt normal at all. When i first seen the objects they whernt that close to gether, they also made a S type flight path, like the light was trying to shake the helicopter off its tail. But by the end of the sighting the light looked like it was right in the piolts faces. It happend so low and fast i almost didnt get outa the house on time. Im north of portland international airpot by not alot so every one there in the tower should of seen it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09072012-0002","City":"Vancouver","Case Number":"42353","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42353.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42353.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.642168,+-122.652566(42353)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42353) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"09/06/2012 10:30 UTC","Summary":"A military helicopter chased a singel solid red light around town.","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/07/2012 02:33 UTC","Longitude":"-122.652566","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"45.642168","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
