It seemed to be a redder colour than the other stars, and as I continued watching, it moved, suddenly, sharply, changing course to a greater distance, then stopping. I exclaimed to my brothers and I pointed to the star. It moved again and was followed by a green coloured star, which just seemed to appear to its left. After a few seconds, the movements started again and it almost looked like they were playing with other; a game across the sky. We watched, literally amazed at what we were witnessing. Before our eyes, another came into the scene, it was yellow and acted like the other two stars, criss-crossing each other in trio for around fifteen minutes. We couldnt tell anything about the lights, any shape other than what looked like flying, coloured stars. They dissapeared from our view and flew off, in different directions at very high speed."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Three starlike objects, were witnessed high in the night sky by myself and two brothers.
