I was driving along a straight road and i noticed that there were three to four white lights in the sky right above the horizon.At first i thought it was a helicopter but then i noticed the lights looked as they were in a disc shape. The lights moved to the center of the road and i was getting closer(about 100 yards), as i got closer the object went into a field to the right of the roadvery quickly and swiftly. As i was passing by the field i looked for the lights and caught a glimpse of them and also a flashing red light at the top. I never stopped to get a closer look because there was no way to get off the road."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hartford","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Hartford","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.1024,+-85.696878(15856)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15856) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"02/28/2009 07:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03052009-0007","Longitude":"-85.696878","Latitude":"31.1024","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15856.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15856.html"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Alabama"}
