In the northeast at about 35 degrees above the horizon I saw a circle of lights that were red green and sometimes white blinking in what seemed to be a random pattern. They stayed in a tight globe , for a while but at some point changed to an oval and cigar. I watched it for at least 40,minutes. In that time it did not move at all.I looked at it with binoculars in focus. I left that setting and the next morning looked into the sky to see what object would be in focus. The were some light cirus clouds at about the same inclination. Thats where the focus was the most clear. So how far away it was I don't know. 10, 20 miles? All the time it did not move. When I went to bed it was still there."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.506395,+-81.688039(12323)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12323) map </A>","City":"Cleveland","Summary":"LIGHTS IN THE SKY (UNMOVING)","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
