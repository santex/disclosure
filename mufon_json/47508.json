(best way to describe it was the standard saucer shape ufo with dome on top and bottom but instead of the saucer being round it was still round but in a triangle shape soft corners not sharp)we watch it for about 20 to 30 seconds with the white light became in an instant almost blinding with in less than a second it flow up and to the west and was small as a star. we all jump back in the car screaming and cursing i drove east toward sweet home as fast as i could while my brother with his head out the passengers window and our friend watch it out the back window telling me it stop than to off again. the three of us had never been that scared before at least i wasn't. i took them home and i was living with my sister in lebanon and i really didn't want to go back that way. i drove to her house and did not see it on the there. the night was clear with stars out and do not remember seeing the moon. there was no sound at anytime when watch it hoovering and flying off. when it was hoovering it was as still as the house was. i did see it again a couple of months later on the same road and will fill out another report."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/19/2013 03:50 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"1:00 am driving home 3 of us saw ufo hoovery over house","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47508.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47508.html"],"Log Number":"US-05192013-0010","Latitude":"43.807523","Object Shape":"Saturn-like, Triangle"}
