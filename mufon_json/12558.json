We were visiting her family for the weekend. It was 1:30 am and I was lying in bed, which was directly in front of the only open window in the room, It had no screen. I saw what appeared to be a shooting star go from east to west. It started slowing down, but never lost its brightness. It came to a stop for just a second then proceeded southward. At this point I knew it was not a shooting star. As soon as it started moving south it curved back to the east and sped up to what appeared to be and infinite acceleration until it seemed to blur into a streek of light. I ran outside to see if there was any other activity, but saw nothing else. Her cousin awoke to me runnung outside. I described to him what I saw and he told me he thought he was the only one who had seen it. He said he had seen the same thing at least 5 times before."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.515606,+-98.967307(12558)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12558) map </A>","Longitude":"-98.967307","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"06/08/2008 01:30 UTC","Case Number":"12558","Object Shape":"Fireball","Summary":"I saw a light move across the sky slow down, turn, then speed off.","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.515606","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Clinton","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
