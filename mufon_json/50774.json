(if i didn't shoot in slow mo. and the object moved the same in vid as if you were standing and observing) the lightning event occurred in 1\\2 sec real time, slowed down to 32 times slower, 16 seconds to play out the entire lightning event. the object takes @ 7 seconds to travel screen. that means the object traveled the distance in .223 of a second. that is fast. you would never ever see this with your naked eye. i have not calculated the distance traveled by the object yet, and am working on that."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"50774","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.659331,+-80.244881(50774)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50774) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/12/2013 04:21 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Florida","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/02/2013 03:36 UTC","Summary":"Object caught inside lightning in 960 frames super slow motion, incredibly fast, makes turn","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Wellington","There were no other sightings in Wellington on or around September 2nd 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.244881"}
