The thumbnail size photo in the camera showed a glow on the right side of the photo. It wasn't until I downloaded the photo to the computer and looked at the enlarged picture where the images showed what that glow was. I thought it was a reflection of their kitchen light but they do not have any fixtures in their home that matches the photo. I also considered a possible double exposier but, can that happen with a digital camera ? Also, this person is just a novice picture taker. I'm not sure what it is, so I'm sharing with the you, the experts."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Runnemede","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Glowing image discovered in a photo taken of a full moon","Date Submitted":"06/06/2012 10:35 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38908.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/38908_submitter_file1__P1020297.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38908.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"38908"}
