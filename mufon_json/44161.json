It was Thanksgiving evening at approximately 6:30 PM. It was a beautiful evening with a clear sky and starting to get dark. I happened to look up and saw a bright orange object over my neighbor���s roof travelling in a southeasterly direction. I told my wife that I had seen something, and we both stood up to get a better view. We saw an orange glowing orb approximately the size of a commercial jet and similar speed, flying across the sky. It was flying at approximately the same height as a small plane, maybe around 5 - 10,000 feet. My wife���s initial reaction was that it was a jet on fire. I quickly ran into the house to get my camera but was so excited that I was fumbling with it and unable to get a picture. (It was new and hadn't figured out the controls yet) I gave my wife the camera and ran to where my pool controls are to turn off our pool light to get a better shot. When I got back to my wife the object suddenly accelerated and within a second we could only see a little orange dot in the sky miles away, before it completely vanished. I have never seen a jet accelerate at this incredible speed. The Object was round and was pulsating with an orange light. The edges of the object were \"fuzzy\" with an orange glow. The object was completely silent as it travelled across the sky."],"Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Summary":"An Orange Orb the the size of a commercial jet was observed travelling South East.","Case Number":"44161","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Sphere","Region":"Arizona","City":"Maricopa","Latitude":"33.08524","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-112.033371","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/26/2012 01:09 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11262012-0010","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 33 other sightings in Maricopa","There were no other sightings in Maricopa on or around November 22nd 2012"],"Date of the Event":"11/22/2012 06:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.08524,+-112.033371(44161)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44161) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
