We reached the stretch of road between White Marsh and Fallston and what looked like a plane traveling very far away was slowly creeping it's way from west to east. Then in a blink it moved east at a speed that was so fast that the light disappeared in a line of light in the sky. I waited about ten seconds and then asked Dave if he had seen that and he excitedly said he had. I had him tell me what he had seen and he confirmed what i saw. We laughed like a couple of kids in disbelief of something amazing. The light went right over the Atlantic faster than i have seen anything move."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28236.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28236.html"],"Case Number":"28236"}
