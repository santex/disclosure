Just looked up to see the objects. Took a couple minutes to figure out what I was looking at - didn't know what they were at first and still don't. Objects would rotate up to reveal 5 bright white lights. Then they would turn to become only a single white light. THey would then emit a red light and dart off into any given direction. They would go down close to the ocean and all the way back up. Distances and speeds unknown. Both objects came in close to the shore after entering the water. This is when we lost them both. One first and the next one a few minutes later."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12481.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12481.html"],"Case Number":"12481","Log Number":"US-09152008-0010","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-118.391789","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.868157,+-118.391789(12481)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12481) map </A>"}
