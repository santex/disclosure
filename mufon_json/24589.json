Out of the corner of my eye I saw this red-ish colored small ball like shape blinking. At first you could just see it hovering between the trees and blinking. Then I noticed that it was moving away from where it was hovering at but very incredibly slowly. Almost as if it would go and then stop briefly before moving on. It continued to do this until it was either no longer in my sight or just gone. This object was flying way to low and way to slow for it to have been any type of a plane."],"Log Number":"US-07172010-0014","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.468141,+-76.93192(24589)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24589) map </A>"}
