They were traveling so fast that by the time I got my phone out to take a pic, they had already descended too far South for my phone to capture photo. It happened over I-75 in Findlay, Ohio if anyone saw same thing? I'm 100% sure that they were not airplanes or just my imagination! They were real and have me in awe to this day!"],"City":"Findlay","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07292013-0012","Object Features":"Dome","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.022717,+-83.662574(49285)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49285) map </A>","Case Number":"49285","Summary":"Four circular-bright orange lights traveled over I-75 on July 25, 2013 headed south.","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/29/2013 09:24 UTC","Longitude":"-83.662574","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Ohio","Latitude":"41.022717"}
