I was catching the 6:45 am bus, and walked to the Amelia side of the station wile waiting. It was cool and a little windy. It was 6:38 am when I saw... well.. I have video and pics. The pic when enlarged shows 3 lights- and nothing attached to them. I saw it after I had gotten on the bus- much larger, and STILL nothing to indicate any mass, structure, or anything other than the light housings. It had grown to about half dollar size by then. I just noticed that the video has recorded sounds- I am unsure if the sounds it recorded are of the object, or distorted traffic noise."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
