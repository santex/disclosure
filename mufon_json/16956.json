I looked up to the sky, and saw a glowing object traveling west to east. It was round; or rather it was a larger sphere with two smaller spheres on the bottom. It was totally silent. The larger sphere glowed orange, and the smaller spheres were blue. It was not a plane, and it did not look like any meteor I ever saw. It moved too quietly and too fast for a plane, and too slowly to be a meteor. The orange glow was very distinct. The two smaller spheres on its bottom were too large for aircraft lights and were not flashing or bright enough. As I said, the object traveled west to east, low in the sky. It wasn���t tiny, nor was it large. It was much larger than a meteor. It was not a fireball. The glow seemed to come from inside the sphere. It didn���t leave any trail; there was no sound, and no electrical malfunctions at my house. When the object passed over me, and was east of me, it completely disappeared. It wasn���t far enough away to have been out of viewing range. It was there and gone. Just like that. I stood outside a while to see if there was any more activity, but I saw nothing else except for flashes of light from a thunderstorm far to the east-southeast. This is the second time I have seen a UFO in the past 4 months. The other one disappeared, then reappeared, then disappeared again. I hoped this one would reappear, but it did not. It was just before 1 am central time. I shook my head after it disappeared and said aloud: \"AWESOME!\""],"Date of the Event":"05/17/2009 12:50 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.430109,+-87.207925(16956)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16956) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"orange sphere with 2 blue spheres attached.","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Pensacola","There were no other sightings in Pensacola on or around May 17th 2009"],"Latitude":"30.430109","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Log Number":"US-05172009-0002","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
