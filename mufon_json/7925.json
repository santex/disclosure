But the object was just hovering and not moving like other planes in the sky. We got our binoculars and telescope and got a close up of the object. And it was disc shaped with bright, red, green, yellow lights circling around the edge of it; it looked like. We saw it the past two nights in a row around the same time. It is in the western sky of long island. If anyone else saw this object. Please post it.
