ALMOST AS IF IT WAS PROJECTING A BEAM.","divs":["Sighting Details Hello I would like someone to contact me about this due to the fact that im still so astonished that this just happened. The event literally happened about 30 minutes ago so I have a clear and vivid picture in my head. My mother and I were outside when we saw a light in the sky with a trail at the end. This object was in earths atmosphere. The trail turned into a beam of light which got sucked into this stationary star and then in the blink of an eye the entire beam of light got sucked into the UFO and it dissapeared. There were no flashing lights. I hope this information can help."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19407.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19407.html"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 08:50 UTC","Case Number":"19407","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Paterson","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Paterson","There were no other sightings in Paterson on or around September 19th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
