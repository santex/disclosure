{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn recent years, I have been awakened at night, roughly 2-3 a.m. about once every 5-6 months apart. I always have this sort of panic feeling when It happens. I usually first hear a sort of snapping sound. Just the other night I heard it again. In my mind���s eye I saw an operating room, and a fuzzy vision of figures standing around what seemed to be an operating table. When I opened my eyes I ���m still in the bedroom, all lights were off, everything seems normal. But a bright light was showing through the window blinds. This bedroom in on the second floor. I looked around and caught something moving in the air. It was very hard to detect. I noticed this sort of wavy motion in the air. I kept starring into the dark to try to catch what was moving around. I noticed this type of a scanner moving very slowly over me and my boyfriend. I could barely see it. It was like a hologram, but I could see this circuitry, very thin wire with a tiny light moving following the wiring. It moved over my head, over my body down to my feet then it shifted over my boyfriend, same pattern. It did not make any noise. And like I said I kept loosing sight of it but then would catch it in my visual field. I wish I had something I could have thrown at it to see if it would bounce off of it or go through it. I got really frightened and screamed, when I did that the light went out and the scanner vanished immediately. I did not tell my boyfriend of this as I know he would think I am crazy. He was not aware of anything, he sleeps very soundly and it���s difficult to wake him.. This seemed to be some sort of scanner for a lack of a better word. It was like stealth. Are we being scanned by an intelligent life? What is going on? Have you heard of this? I can say more things like this have happened to me in other places over the past 5 years. But I never saw this scanner before. Can you tell me if you have heard of this type of event??"],"Date Submitted":"05/17/2010 07:10 UTC","Region":"Kentucky","Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23336.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23336.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.749536","City":"Louisville","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Louisville","There were no other sightings in Louisville on or around May 2nd 2010"],"Weather Factors":"Rain, Medium","Tags":"City","Summary":"Bright light shining in 2nd story bedrm window, scanning device hovering over me.","Object Features":"Insignia","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05172010-0007","Latitude":"38.262115","Case Number":"23336","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.262115,+-85.749536(23336)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23336) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/02/2010 02:30 UTC"}
