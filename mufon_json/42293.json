{"Case Number":"42293","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","divs":["Sighting DetailsCamping on site 36 at McGinnins campground in Holly, MI I saw an identical object, but did not have my camera. I watched and saw it again. Those 2 times it was moving from the south to the north west. My husband went in the camper, I kept watching and it suddenly appeared over the tree tops above our camper. I yelled it is back and he stepped out - the object stopped making no sound but the dogs at a near by camp site were howling like crazy! As I was filming, you can see the flight pattern with stopping, going, up down, etc. about 50' above the trees. I am not sure if I saw 3 different or 1 object that returned as there was no more than 1 object together at a time. I filmed it but the film does not give it justice - the object was glowing red orange, egg or coned shape. We watched for it the night of 9-3-12 but were not able to see anything other than regular planes. We lost sight of the object as it flew northwest and away from us."],"Longitude":"-83.618826","Object Features":"Other","Object Shape":"Egg","Latitude":"42.796033","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09042012-0012","Date of the Event":"09/02/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/04/2012 01:26 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Silent glowing orange red object gliding through the night sky","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Holly","There were no other sightings in Holly on or around September 2nd 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42293.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42293.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.796033,+-83.618826(42293)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42293) map </A>","City":"Holly","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
