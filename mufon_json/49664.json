When one of my sons called out \"what the heck is that?\" So I looked up almost right above us when I caught sight of a strange object floating across the sky. I ran into the house and grabbed my digital camera, and adjusted the settings to get a good look at it. I was estonished to see that it wasnt 1 object but 3 and it was changing shape. I couldnt believe my eyes when I noticed apendages under and over the top object. The UFO continued on a NE path until I lost sight of it.
