NOT ONLY DID WE PICK UP THE OBJECT BUT ALSO THE THREE OTHER MISSLE SITES & LORING AFB (A SAC BASE) & ALSO NORAD. THE OBJECT WAS MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST AT APPROX 600 MPH. OUR RADAR VAN OFFICER & OTHER VAN OFFICERS AT THE OTHER MISSLE SITES TRIED TO CONTACT THE OBJECT TO IDENTIFY ITSELF. THIS WAS TO NO AVAIL. OUR MISSLES WERE UP & READY TO GO IF THE OBJECT CROSSED THE BORDER. LORING AFB ALSO HAD THEIR JETS IN THE AIR. SUDDENLY THE OBJECT IMMEDIATELY STOPPED, FROM 600 MPH TO \"0\" IN AN INSTANT THEN WENT STRAIGHT UP. THE RADAR HAS A GLITCH EXPLAINED THE VAN OFFICER, & THAT WAS THE END OF IT.
