Their was a very bright light which I though was an aircraft landing lights, but all of a sudden their were six to eight smaller lights popped up one right after another to the right of it. I am a private pilot and I know that ATC could not turn that many aircraft at one time. I called my wife to come see the event and when to get my camcorder. This took at lest three to four minutes. The bright object was still in the same place and had not moved. If this was an aircraft on approach to O'Hare it would have long been out of my viewing area. My balcony is on the six floor above the tree line. I recorded about two plus minutes which was all the time left on the dvd disc. I did not stay to see how long after that that the light stayed before it left."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Skokie","There were no other sightings in Skokie on or around September 28th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.067814,+-87.761092(33125)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33125) map </A>","Latitude":"42.067814","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-87.761092","Log Number":"US-11042011-0006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33125.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33125.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"09/28/2011 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
