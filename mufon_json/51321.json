I went onto the front porch and saw one fireball moving across the sky. I knew this was not a metoer! The fireball moved slowly across the sky from North to South. It did not descend, just moved across the sky in the manner an airplane would do. As the first fireball moved farther away from us, a second one appeared. It came from the north and followed the same path as the first fireball. I ran into the nearby field and saw inside the first fireball was a chevron shaped vehicle with 3 tail-lights glowing blue, yellow and red. It seemed as if time was standing still for me, yet I was excited. The fireballs just kept moving in a South direction until they faded from view. We tried to take a photo, but the camera would not cooperate."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.933496,+-87.891167(51321)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51321) map </A>","Case Number":"51321","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.891167","Log Number":"US-10052013-0009","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Mount Vernon","There were no other sightings in Mount Vernon on or around August 10th 2013"],"Summary":"witnessed two fireball like objects, traveling one behind the other. the one farthest away became somewhat transparent and there appeared inside a chevron shaped vehicle with tail lights.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51321.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51321.html"],"Latitude":"37.933496","Date Submitted":"10/05/2013 05:13 UTC"}
