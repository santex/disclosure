Me my wife and son where just starting to barb becue when I just looked up It was perfectly calm when I saw what at first thought was a bunch of silver balloons. They where in a perfect cross formation but what was strange is only one was blinking. I think that was what caught my attention, but as Im watching it I slowly realize that they are a lot bigger than any balloon I have seen before. Also I noticed they where just not moving like balloons I thought they should sway a little but nothing. I was really close to It and their was nothing holding them together they traveled in an easterly direction and after a half of a mile moved straight up into the clouds the hole time just the one blinked. Never seen any thing travel as such."],"Date of the Event":"07/05/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"Multi shiny metal spheres like balloons but very large traveling perfectly then straight up into the clouds.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24628.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24628.html"],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Middle Island","There were no other sightings in Middle Island on or around July 5th 2009"]}
