{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["sighting detailsi live in a well known historical building on the southside of downtown dallas on the 7th floor. my girlfriend and i were watching tv, i was laid out on a couch by the wall with all the windows on it facing south. i stood up from the couch and randomly looked out the window, as i did i saw something moving and glowing faintly in the sky a couple hundred feet above a 10-story building to the left of my vision. within, the initial split second that i saw \"something\" in my mind i thought and tried to figure out if i was seeing some sort of light reflection from the room back in the window, as it had just rained and there were raindrops on the windows and i wasn't sure if when i stood up and was moving i was seeing some sort of diffuse interior light refracted in the window, so i steadied myself. as i steadied myself to make sure i was indeed seeing something it passed through my head that these might be the beam of a spotlight \\ marquis light in the sky (the kind they use for sales events), and by this time i realized it was 3 diffused, cloudlike glows moving through the sky, from left to right. now in the time i stood up and the spotted this and reasoned all this it was only about 3-4 seconds and i was concurrently saying out loud to my girlfriend \"what the heck is that, do you see that [around the point that i was steadying myself for a good look]\". as i stood there still i realized that it was definitely 3 objects, diffused behind the clouds (it was a rainy night with low clouds). the objects looked like diffuse oval glows (almost like clouds themselves, just slightly brighter), approximately only about 800-1000 feet in the sky, headed in a slight slant upwards into the southern sky. they moved at a very steady, uniform speed and trajectory and acceleration, nothing too wavy or unexpected. and just gradually, smoothly increased speed until they gradually moved up into the sky, the darkness and could no longer be discerned. my girlfriend had stood up with me to watch them, and the whole time i was asking \"do you see it, do you see them\", and she kept saying \"where? i'm trying\". finally, she said \"i think i saw them\". the objects weren't anything spectacular, like obviously defined crafts, but just like glowing clouds. the way they moved, with this steady smooth acceleration and at such low altitude i reasoned just could not be military or civilian aircrafts. i've never see any man made object fly through the sky like that, it was very smooth, and in fact very quick, but a very gradual quickness. after they were gone, had just gradually faded, my girlfriend stood there with me, intent upon seeing them, she suggested they might come back, i was like \"no, they're definitely not coming back around\", they appeared as if they were setting out, taking off, if you will, off into the sky, not like they were hovering or floating around. we looked around in the window to see if anything came back around, or if anything else was out in the sky and indeed never saw anything."],"Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Hoax","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Longitude":"-96.762303","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10506.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10506.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10506.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/23/2008 11:24 UTC","Log Number":"US-04242008-0003","Date of the Event":"04/23/2008 11:24 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"3 diffuse glowing, blended orbs move across sky","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around April 23rd 2008"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval","City":"Dallas","Latitude":"32.809955","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"10506","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.809955,+-96.762303(10506)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10506) map </A>"}
