When i realized it was there i showed a few friends and thought it was rather interesting. thinking about it later i was kind of puzzeled as to how i didnt notice it at the time, only after i had taken the picture."],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around May 29th 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/29/2012 06:28 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"44233","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.18005","Longitude":"-80.239751","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44233.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44233.html"]}
