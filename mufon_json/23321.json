around 10pm with an inexplicable event. what i saw was a grey, transparent form which approached me as i lay on the couch at home. i work in a coal mine as a driller and i live in a share house, but i am often home alone. this \"form\" only stood about 4 1\\2 feet tall with no discernible features. i was terrified at the time and leapt up on the couch shrieking at whatever this was. it vanished up the hallway where i watched it linger for about 5 minutes. after i composed myself, i became extremely curious. through my fear i attempted to call it over, but it wouldn't come toward me again. my supervisor arrived at our house at around 11pm and i explained to him what i saw before falling asleep on the couch. at first, i thought it was a spirit entity of a deceased person, but events after this have caused me to believe this was workings of extra terrestrials. my supervisor informed me yesterday of strange behavior during my sleep which he observed from another chair. he told me that i leapt from the couch, eyes wide open in panic while gasping for air. he said it appeared that i was having great trouble breathing and was about to call the ambulance, but then i lay back down and was peacefully fast asleep. i have no recollection of this event, and i have had several episodes of disorientation recently, some of which have had about 10 minutes that i cannot account for. this sleep disruption prompted me to voice record my sleep activity. i had the sudden notion that doing so may reveal me communicating with something? while i slept. the playback was as disturbing as it was intriguing. after about 3 hours of sleep, i can hear myself communicating with something else. i was home alone while this recording took place, and you can physically hear the voice of a being having a short conversation with me. the voice is very deep and monotone and needs professional media analysis to hear exactly what it is saying to me (i'm dying to know!). i hear it talk first, then i say \"who?\" it speaks again and i say \"okay\" again it speaks and i say \"i don't care\", at this point it's volume and pitch raises and it appears to say \"don't say that!\". the next event happened a week later in the same spot on the couch while i was half asleep with dim light in the room. i saw a number of the same grey forms which were placing their hands on my legs and working their way up my body, one after the other. this time i felt an overwhelming sense of calm and euphoria as this took place and i could physically feel where they were applying pressure. whatever happened, my senses have heightened greatly. sometimes when i sense presence, my physiological reaction is so strong that i feel like i might pass out. this happened a short while ago while i was working in my drill rig so i got the voice recorder out after calling out aloud \"who is here\". the playback is the same sounding voice only much louder and more distinct which says \"c a a x\". i work completely alone on my drill on nightshift 5 nights a week. i was drilling in quite an isolated place at this time with nothing but vacant land as far as you can see and the mine workings are behind me. i had turned all radios off, idled the engine back, and silently watched the phone as it recorded. i didn't hear any sounds at the time of recording. the only other sound present is the hum of the drill. it was then revealed to me mentally somehow that this entity can manipulate ambient sounds to form words, thus the louder result in this case from the drill as opposed to the fainter sound of the aircon unit while i slept. in addition, the speech is inaudible whilst being transmuted into a recorder. on the 10th of may, something told me to shut the lights off in my drill and look outside. it was then that i observed a bright orange light shoot from the ground up to maybe 5000 feet or so. upon further observation, i made out 3 orange lights which appeared to be rotating clockwise. it then shot up approximately double the distance again and while i strained to see, it appeared to be repeating the rotation sequence. it disappeared after 10 minutes and then i emailed my sighting to this website: http:\\\\www.ufoinfo.com\\phone.shtml#australia at this email address: auforn@hypermax.net.au but my email was returned \"undelivered\". the following night i received a distinct mental message to stand and look out my front, drill rig window. being ready for anything by this stage, i video recorded this short moment. i saw nothing until played the video back. on this clip, an object can be seen to propel down vertically, make an impossible turn that would crush a human, and jet away horizontally. i slowed the video down on my computer and watched over and over as this thing moved. i took a still shot of it and zoomed in. it appears to be cigar or saucer shape and left a grey contrail. shortly after, i felt a great sense of discomfort and panic. i shut my rig down and felt like i had to leave immediately. i ran over to my ute and was paralyzed as i saw a bright orange light approaching me at no more that a few hundred feet high. i \"knew\" that it was coming to see me. it got to about a kilometre away and what at first just looked like light, appeared to have mass behind it. it was completely silent as it moved. i stood terrified, not sure whether to stay or go. my flight response kicked in, i jumped in the car and sped away. after an hour of scanning the sky i returned to my rig. i heard over a large number of mining equipment calling workshop for electrical problems over the mine two-way for the duration of the shift. i have since been \"receiving\" information which i cannot explain but after some net research, find validation or synchonicities of this information. it's now becoming a task of discernment between what is \"received\" and what is imagination. the most of which that seems to be accurate is naturally when something comes to me while i'm consciously thinking of something else. i am happy to share the evidence that i have, but i'd like solid reassurance that it won't be reproduced or shared without my permission first. thank you for reading. i look forward to speaking with someone about this. sincerely, [cms\\tg\\pid]"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"121.031961","Date of
