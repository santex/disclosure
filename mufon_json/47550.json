I got a pair of binoculars to get a better look. I could see a dark outline of the object and it appeared to be a diamond shape with multiple colored lights in a cross like pattern. My wife and I observed the object for an hour and it slowly headed west away from us. It would move slowly and then hover for a while and then move again. We have seen unexplained lights in the sky before, but nothing like this. This was a solid object with definition."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/20/2013 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47550.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47550.html"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Date Submitted":"05/21/2013 09:07 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"Ligonier","Log Number":"US-05212013-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.245828,+-79.234732(47550)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47550) map </A>","Case Number":"47550","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
