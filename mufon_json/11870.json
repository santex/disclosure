It was three dimensional with six spokes. It was not spinning, or did it have any air traffic control lights. If you held a half-dollar up to the object it would block it out.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting Details1. Where were you and what were you doing at the time? Playing catch with a neighborhood friend. 2. What made you first notice the object?  F14s were being scattered at Miramar Nava Air Station aka Top Gun. I mentioned to my friend I wonder what was going on at the base. This went on for about an hour prior to the sighting. At 7:15 an orange object shaped like a medicine wheel with six spokes caught my eye . 3. What did you think the object was when you first noticed it?  Immediately I told my friend to look up and look at it. By the time he looked up the object was gone. But, we started joking about the object hoping it would land in school and disintegrate it. After 45 minutes of joking around, the jets were still being scattered and the object caught my eye again and this time my friend also saw it. 4. Describe the object and its actions and motions? This object was bright neon orange. It was three dimensional with six spokes. It was not spinning, or did it have any air traffic control lights. If you held a half-dollar up to the object it would block it out. There was no sound and no tail, just a solid object that you could see the night sky through the spokes. 5. Describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object? We were kids and joking about it. But after seeing it the second time we ran and told our parents, who also joked about it. My Dad said I had too much root beer, and my friend���s dad, who worked at Lockheed, said it was marsh gas (in San Diego?) 6. How did you lose sight of the object? It moved from a East to West movement and disappeared over the horizon. The second fly over happened in 45 minutes, as soon as I saw the object again, I looked at my skin diving watch to verify the time. I am a NASA Engineer and this sighting motivated my into physics and working with NASA. I can provide verification of my NASA employment."],"Log Number":"US-08012008-0019","Object Shape":"Circle, Cross, Saturn-like","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11870.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11870.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.49306,+-122.45556(11870)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11870) map </A>","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Miramar","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"08/14/1968 07:15 UTC"}
