I thought maybe it was the moon, but I've never seen the sun and the moon line up in the same horizon. What is this? I don't really know. It is not an airplane, because I watch the airplanes come and go from the airport and can see them clearly from my deck. This object was simply sitting there and suddnely it seem to back out or away and dissappeared instantly.
