As I looked west, saw a bluish-white light streak from high in sky toward the west. It only lasted a few seconds before it disappeared from view, behind the house next to ours. At first I though it was a shooting star, but the skies are overcast, so it had to be low enough to be passing through clouds. When it happened, I actually thought that it was going to hit the ground far off and I waited for an explosion or rumble, but never heard anything."],"City":"Kansas City","Longitude":"-94.576567","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Summary":"Bright bluish-white circle of light streaked toward west and looked like it would crash into ground","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.101576","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash","Date of the Event":"01/31/2010 08:40 UTC"}
