I thought it was a satteilite until it suddenly made a 180 degree turn. it started flying around crazily for about 2 minutes until it flew away from the \"M\" painted on the mountain nearest to my house. It flew toward my house and got larger until it suddenly plummeted downward and then straight up. It then got smaller and disapearred. that was the first time it happened. It has happened around here erratically since then.
