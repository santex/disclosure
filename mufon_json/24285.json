I figured they were stars. So as I pulled into my apartment complex i looked down the road to my left and saw the objects in a different formation. I turned around , parked, got out and observed these things for approximatly 2 minutes. the moved slowely as if they were intelligent, while huge fireworks were going off beneath them. My mom called and I explained to her what I was observing at the time. Once i hung up they started to move out toward the east end of Long Island, They started to follow each other 1 by 1 in a straight line and as they got further away, they started to dissapear in Sequence, 1 at a time, until the last one dissappeared. It was amazing. I was so happy after 35 years i finally had a sighting of my own. I took 2 photos but they were black."],"Case Number":"24285","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.757043","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 03:37 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bellport","There were no other sightings in Bellport on or around July 4th 2010"]}
