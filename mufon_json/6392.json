{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis picture was taken by my buddy who is flying to New York as I speak , he was in terminal L10 Delta airlines at 2:45 PM and noticed this UFO shaped hole in the clouds ,as u can tell its huge and looks like a UFO ripped thru it, it caught his eye and a few other passengers in the terminal. I just thought I would post this in light of all the recent buzz over the UFO activity in the last months over O'Hare. My friend Tom who took the picture with his phone said that the clouds reformed and the hole was not visible by 3p.m so it was visible for 15 minutes"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02162007-0003","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"6392","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6392.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6392_submitter_file1__hole.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6392.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","Date of the Event":"02/16/2007 02:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.625698","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/16/2007 02:45 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Chicago","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.884264,+-87.625698(6392)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6392) map </A>","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around February 16th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.884264","Summary":"UFO shaped hole in clouds over O'Hare airport"}
