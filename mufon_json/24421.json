I grabbed the binoculars and followed it for a few seconds, seeing a sphere with all this glowing light coming out of it.��� When I went for the camera, though, it slowly, slowly fizzled out to nothing - despite my pleading aloud for it to stay.��� (I guess it was somebody who didn't want their picture taken!��� ;)) Anyway, I saw a gray craft last September, and I just knew intuitively that it was Arcturians.��� This time, though, I didn't get a feeling about WHO it was, but I know they were good and loving."],"Summary":"Bright light craft!","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-81.172733","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.787221","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in St Thomas","There were no other sightings in St Thomas on or around July 10th 2010"],"Log Number":"CA-07102010-0028","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.787221,+-81.172733(24421)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24421) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24421.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24421.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Egg, Oval, Sphere, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown"}
