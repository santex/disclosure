{"divs":["Sighting Detailsmy friends and i have wittnessed several ufos over the central bucks county area over the past 2-3 weeks. We are not sure exactly what they are but they appear low in the sky, brighter than any star and do not move for hours until they dissapear. We have taken pictures and still cannot figure out what they are. It dissapears from night to night, doesnt twinkle, and when staring at it long enough the light takes on the shape of a cross. The pictures we took look nothing like what we saw in the sky, and show strange flight patterns."],"Object Shape":"Cross, Star-like","Log Number":"US-02182009-0013","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15576.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15576_submitter_file1__ufo1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15576_submitter_file2__ufo2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15576_submitter_file3__ufo3.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15576.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"Feasterville-Trevose","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.145298,+-74.996139(15576)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15576) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/03/2009 08:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-74.996139","Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","Latitude":"40.145298","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Feasterville-Trevose","There were no other sightings in Feasterville-Trevose on or around February 3rd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"15576","Summary":"Bright starlike objects low in sky.","Date of the Event":"02/03/2009 08:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
