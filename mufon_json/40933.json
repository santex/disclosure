We were throwing the ball for the two dogs we have. I looked up and saw a glowing orange ball that was hovering. It looked like it was on fire! I called my son to look. He did a video with his IPhone. We did not know what the object was. It was hovering at first, then it started to move left very slowly not making a sound! Then after a few seconds it stated to vanish. Then after we looked the video, we could see it go up and then it seemed to appear in the upper right corner. There could have been more then one but we did not see that until viewing the video. We were very excited and a little freaked out too!"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.753534,+-121.278226(40933)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40933) map </A>"}
