{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving westbound on Thome Road towards Highway 40 south of Rock Falls. I had a full view of the western horizon. No clouds other than some very thin high see through clouds. Observed an extremely white ball of light suddenly appear to the west directly in front of me. Height and distance unknown. Not blinking or moving. It suddenly disappeared then reappeared approximately 20 seconds later much further out and to the SW. The light was now bright red. While observing this red light it simply went out and was gone. No other lights or craft were observed in any direction for as far as I could see. It was still light out and not dark yet when this took place."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Rock Falls","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42583.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42583.html"],"Longitude":"-89.679737","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.785083,+-89.679737(42583)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42583) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09152012-0020","Summary":"Bright white light.
