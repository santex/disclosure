As I was observing it it started to change shape, or rather it extended. Off the left side it seemed to grow longer. After about 5 minutes the part that grew started to retract back in. After it retracted back in it just turned into a bright ball of light. Within 5 minutes it dwindled down to nothing and disappeared. (In the pictures im submitting, the object is to the very left of the palm trees. This photo is from my phone so its not the greatest quality but you will see the ball of light I observed. Feel free to contact me for any info)"],"Longitude":"-117.982049","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"None"}
