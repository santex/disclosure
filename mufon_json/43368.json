Called to two neighbors in their garage to observe and all of us saw an object passing northwest at 7:58 Saturday, Oct. 13th, 2012, perfectly horizontally. About the slowest speed of a freqent A10 from our AFB up north (Grissom). We saw an orange (flaming) glow from the side of the vehicle. All 3 of us saw the event. Reports of a UFO were printed in the Greenwood newspaper two days later; emitting blue light. Our object flew straight and level out of sight to the NW. Trees to the NW eliminated further viewing."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Log Number":"US-10182012-0023","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43368.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43368.html"],"City":"Pendleton","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Summary":"Observed orange light traveling NW with a flaming orange light perfectly horizonatal above trees.","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"10/13/2012 07:58 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/18/2012 10:33 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.007373,+-85.724047(43368)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43368) map </A>","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Pendleton","There were no other sightings in Pendleton on or around October 13th 2012"],"Case Number":"43368","Longitude":"-85.724047","Latitude":"40.007373"}
