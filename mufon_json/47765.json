{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWitness to what I believe was my first light ship sighting! 3 friends and myself were sitting outside at a fire pit enjoying the fire over the holiday at a nearby cabin and suddenly saw bright, beautiful golden colorful lights in the sky, appearing one at a time then flying in an arc then disappearing. the shapes were all the same as I would describe them as triangular or boomerang. one, two, three up to five in the air at one time flying across in the same arc. then disappeared. this went on about 20-30 minutes. then all disappeared. My reaction? As author of 2012 and Beyond: The Truth from Archangel Michael....lightships!! Some of the others thought it was fireworks. No way! the objects disappeared but not as though they flew so far out of sight to disappear...just disappeared."],"Date of the Event":"05/26/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Augusta","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-05312013-0015","Latitude":"38.572552","Country":"United States","Region":"Missouri","Date Submitted":"05/31/2013 06:53 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47765.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47765.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"47765","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","City":"Augusta","Longitude":"-90.882081","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.572552,+-90.882081(47765)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47765) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Summary":"golden lights in augusta missouri!","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
