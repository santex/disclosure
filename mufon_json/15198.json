I realized it was very low in the sky when i first noticed the bright ball at dusk. I really thought it was Jupiter until my daughter said,\"look Daddy it's moving. we were Bar-b Q'n out back at dusk when what appeared to be the planet Jupiter appeared. I remember before the sighting that the entire time i was outside i elt as if i was being watched. the Sphere was very close above us when we later noticed. I yelled for my son to come out and see this amazing bright sphere and it started to move south faily fast and stopped, never making a sound. then it started to move out of the atmosphere at what seemed to be lightspeed then it was gone. My son only caught the last part of it as it disappeared. My daughter and I are left questioned and saying WOW!
