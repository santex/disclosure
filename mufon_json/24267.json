{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe had just returned home to Nixa MO. We were out back of our duplex after returning from a 4th of July party, and had just began making a fire in our fire pit. My girlfriend suddenly pointed south and said, \"Justin what is that.\" I looked to the sky, and immediately saw a glowing object flying at a very high rate of speed. I quickly noticed it didn't have any flashing beacons like normal aircraft do. I also quickly noticed that it was moving much faster than a normal plane would be at a high elevation. My second thought was that it was a helicopter flying at a lower elevation, but there was absolutley no sound. It was obviously flying at a low enough elevation to of made some sort of sound if it had been a plane or a helicopter. It flew in a straight line from south to north, and it never made any sharp turns. We watched it for approximately 90 to 120 seconds, until it dissapeared from sight from the distance it had traveled."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"24267","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Me and my girlfriend saw a glowing orb shaped object flying south to north.","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 09:59 UTC","City":"Nixa","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/05/2010 01:15 UTC","Longitude":"-93.292823","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.049406,+-93.292823(24267)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24267) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07062010-0018","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"37.049406","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Nixa","There were no other sightings in Nixa on or around July 5th 2010"],"Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24267.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24267.html"]}
