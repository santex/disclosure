About half way to Stephenville I noticed a large white light to my left. I looked over to see a disc shaped light lift from the ground and was moving to the North at a high rate of speed and then just blinked out. I never saw it again. It was very fast and i'm not sure if it was on the ground or not but I think it was about 2 or 3 miles away. Its hard to tell in the dark."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25871.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25871.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/13/2010 11:02 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Hoax","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dublin","There were no other sightings in Dublin on or around October 13th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.087993,+-98.339548(25871)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25871) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10142010-0004","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
