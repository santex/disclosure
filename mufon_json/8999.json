There were some clouds, but I saw the blinking light of an airplane moving regularly up ahead. When I looked West, I saw a light that was significantly larger than the plane, but still flying at a decent altitude. It was moving significantly faster than a plane. It was far too large and not nearly fast enough to be a shooting star. It flew like it was being navigated and was not flying in an orbital path like a satellite. It moved to the clouds, and when it got to them it disappeared. At the time I believed it was just hidden by the clouds, which it may have been, but the more I think about it, the more I think it just disappeared. This had me a little shaken up because of the recent sightings of a UFO in Texas that has been on the news. I saw one video that CNN ran of the UFO that was not well shot, but if that was the UFO they were seeing, the UFO I saw was identical to it. I have seen planes, helicopters, shooting stars and satellites, but I have never seen anything like this before."],"Date of the Event":"01/18/2008 03:35 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Latitude":"39.174635","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"00:00:06","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8999.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8999.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"8999","Summary":"Large Light, too low and way too fast to be a plane, not a shooting star or satellite.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-01182008-0007","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Bloomington","There were no other sightings in Bloomington on or around January 18th 2008"],"City":"Bloomington","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.174635,+-86.518996(8999)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8999) map </A>"}
