After hearing about it i was skeptical but when i saw the film i was at a loss. The film was from the press box of our football stadium angled down to the south half of the field. During a play a fast white object similar in speed and appearance to a golf ball flies from the right of the screen and angles up to the top left. Obviuosly we would notice someone hitting golf balls over the football teams' heads, plus the location and angle would be impossible for it to be a golf ball. The image on freeze frame is blurry. But i cannot even make a suggestion as to what it may be."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28771.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28771.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/15/2009 04:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.062464,+-78.870228(28771)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28771) map </A>","Latitude":"35.062464"}
