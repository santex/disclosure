At first it looked like a plane, but I noticed it was not moving at all, and much brighter than other planes I often see flying lower in the sky. I then saw two planes flying at the same time as this bright light that was not moving. I was facing towards the East, high in the night sky I observed a light, brighter than a plane. I knew it was strange, so I called my mom to have her view it from our balcony at home, too. It was stationary for about 5 minutes, in the last minute of visability it seemed to move upward rather quickly. Then I could no longer view it through the clouds it seemed to rise higher up into."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"05/12/2011 10:31 UTC","Region":"Illinois","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29072.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29072.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"Strange bright light.","Log Number":"US-05122011-0010","Date of the Event":"05/12/2011 09:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Egg, Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.422532,+-87.985886(29072)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29072) map </A>","Case Number":"29072","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.985886","City":"Manhattan"}
