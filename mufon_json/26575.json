Today while smoking a cigarette out my 3rd floor apt window - I saw in the clear blue sky a bright star-like object moving at a very subtle speed - then increasing in speed and slightly changing direction. I rushed outside to get a better view - and there it was stopped, or at least barely moving. Then it came to a stationary position - and slowly began to move to the right. After about it a minute it just disappeared. Although it was too far away to see it's exact shape - I don't know of any airplanes or helicopters that behave like this - I don't believe it fits into any category besides unidentified."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.810235","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Bright star-like object - varying speeds - stopped, turned direction","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.810235,+-74.176251(26575)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26575) map </A>","City":"Bloomfield","Log Number":"US-11142010-0017","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26575.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26575.html"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/14/2010 04:28 UTC"}
