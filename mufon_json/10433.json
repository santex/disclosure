By 12:10 I had gotten up to go outside and watch the storm. After watching several cloud to ground strikes I noticed that a couple of bolts were going cloud to cloud from the east to the north. Since I like to count strike to thunder seconds for distance I noticed these bolts were visible from 3 to 4 seconds and did not produce any audible thunder. They were fairly straight bolts and in one spot little branches would fork of the main bolt and the cloud in that area would glow. The feelings I had about what I saw next are very hard to describe as I am still in awe of the experience. The third bolt shot across in exactly the same place and the same manner as the first two except this time the clouds parted and right there in plain sight was a solid glassy looking metallic craft in the clouds. The lightning was dancing all over the slightly curved surface of the object. That was only visible for about two seconds until the bolt dissipated then all was dark again. This sighting was a 12:17 AM I waited several minutes for something to happen again but nothing. I don���t know if the object left the area or the clouds moved in to hide it from my view. The thunderstorm lasted for another halfhour."],"Longitude":"-117.424977"}
