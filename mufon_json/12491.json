Laurie,Mo.","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn the fall about 3yrs. ago I was sitting in my living room watching tv by myself at about 11pm, when a bright light outside my living room window caught my eye. It looked like a bright headlight. I went outside on the deck to see what it was. There was now sound. It was a clear night, very still. The object was about 150 yards from my deck and about 40ft. off the ground. It was moving slowly down the fairway. Seemed to bob up & down & move from one side to the other. I watched it go all the way down the fairway to the valley when I lost sight of it. About 2-3 minutes. I came back in, I was freezing."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Missouri"}
