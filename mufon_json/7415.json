{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","divs":["sighting detailsi went to check on my cat, who had just been hit by a car (its an outdoor cat) and i open the door and right over the trees in front of my house is a big white \\ orange light. this is the second time this week i have seen this light in roughly the same area, and i have seen it on the other side of town once prior to the past 2 events about 2-3 weeks back. it caught my eye both nights because it was to bright to be a star, to close as well, and also to quiet to be a helicopter or airplane. im not to good with direction, i think it might of been twords gentry direction, i dont know if this is associated with the other gentry sighting i saw on ur page. but if it is, this could help confirm something. the object hoverd for a bit and i turned on the portch light, and i could see it kind of move in a circle slowly, then slowly went down behind the trees, this was over a period of 15-20 mins. on both nights it remained roughly the same time. it kind of gave me an uneasy feeling to watch, but yet i was so intrigued by it. my fiance saw it the first night as well, but she wasnt able to watch it the whole time like i did."],"Date Submitted":"07/10/2007 08:45 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.335911,+-94.460771(7415)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7415) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-94.460771","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"7415","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"36.335911","Date of the Event":"07/10/2007 08:45 UTC","Region":"Arkansas","Summary":"UFO seen over trees for 2nd time","City":"Decatur","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Decatur","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7415.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7415.html"],"Log Number":"US-07112007-0002","Object Shape":"Fireball"}
