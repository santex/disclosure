While we were waiting on the kids to knock on a door, I noticed two stars in the sky that were extremely bright. I said to my husband, look how bright those stars are, you would think I would have noticed then before as bright as they are side by side. He said, well let's pull up google star gazing ap and see what they are. As he pulled his phone out, I kept my eyes on the lights. I noticed them begin to fade, I thought my vision was playing tricks on me, but my husband was noticing it too. We watched them completely disappear right before our eyes. Two to three minutes later, the outside temperature felt ten degrees warmer outside."],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lenexa","There was one other sighting in Lenexa on or around October 31st 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/01/2011 09:01 UTC"}
