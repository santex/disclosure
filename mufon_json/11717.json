When the lights went out on this object you could still see an outline of the large stationary vehical? about 5 seconds later another smaller light appeared above the object, and disappeared.The night was very clear, as I noticed alot of air traffic above the seen object (maybe 4-5 planes). I waited and watched another 5 min with no more lights. My first thought was it was some Military exercise, but I have seen flares before , and this was not flares."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"UFO seen in Central Indiana","Region":"Indiana","Date of the Event":"07/24/2008 10:30 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in Kokomo","There was one other sighting in Kokomo on or around July 24th 2008"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.488637,+-86.129593(11717)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11717) map </A>","Case Number":"11717","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07242008-0024","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11717.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11717.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.129593"}
