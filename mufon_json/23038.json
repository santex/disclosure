This lasted only a short period of time, perhaps 6 seconds maximum. The arc was perhaps 20 (less than 30). The azimuth was approx. 75. It simply disappeared. There was no tail or trail of light. Just what appeared to be a relatively small star moving very, very fast. I was just lucky I looked up when I did and saw it and followed it.
