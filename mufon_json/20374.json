{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in the midst of the afternoon commute on the Diagonal Highway which connects Boulder, CO with Longmont, CO. I was driving northbound around 5:00 pm--still broad daylight--when I noticed an oddly symmetrical dark rectangle hanging in fairly heavy haze about a mile east (right) of the highway. It was hovering at approximately 30��� above the horizon (90��� being straight overhead) It had the same aspect ratio and rectangular, rounded-cornered shape as the spacebar on the typical computer keyboard. There were no clouds in the sky at all, looking in that direction. I kept stealing glances at the object as the traffic flowed along, to see if the shape would change or the object showed any signs of movement. As I drove further, a stand of trees was coming up on the right, which I knew would obstruct my view of the object when they went by, I prepared myself to take up the observation again when the trees were passed. When I cleared the trees the sky was completely empty. I kept glancing to the right for several minutes but the object had completely disappeared."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.103874,+-105.170819(20374)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20374) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Niwot","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"40.103874","Date Submitted":"11/08/2009 12:05 UTC","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20374.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20374.html"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11082009-0002","Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"20374","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"11/06/2009 05:00 UTC","Summary":"Shaped like the spacebar on a computer keyboard.
