{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile sitting on the shore, after observing a very disturbing UFO, I saw a flash of white light, just above the big dipper. Shortly later, from the west, I observed a \"star-like\" light. I watched it, and that's when I noticed that it was moving in my direction. Having seen a couple of UFO's in the past, I did not panic, but sat still and watched it's progress, which was that it followed a straight path right in front of me! I was shaped like a blimp (but I called it a jelly-belly, because it was illuminated from with an orange glow). It traveled steadily from the west to the north east at a constant speed. It had no exterior lights, sound, nor did it seem to threaten me. I have owned an airplane and I know what they sound and look like. As I just said NO SOUND. I was delighted to see another one so soon. It simply traveled out of sight, and was gone."],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Egg, Oval","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-85.988853","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51246.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51246.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"08/14/2012 11:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Glen Arbor","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"51246","Date Submitted":"10/01/2013 08:42 UTC","Latitude":"44.897731","Log Number":"US-10012013-0019","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.897731,+-85.988853(51246)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51246) map </A>","City":"Glen Arbor","Summary":"While star gazing I noticed a star like light to the west over Lk Michigan on Aug 14, 2012, at approx ll:15PM.
