He had to be at work at 6 am. He was going by Long Wharf, approaching the Cue Bridge on Rte. 95, when he viewed a light to the NE -- a bright, almond-shaped light, with a little bubble-like attachment to the lower point. He estimated that it was approx. ��� mile from the bridge, est. 2-3000 feet in altitude, and was approx. 100 feet across. It was between the defunct power plant and a 120 ft high white wind turbine. It was not blinking; it was approx. over the Grand St. area of Fairhaven (witness during phone interview consulted a Rand McNally map of New Haven to estimate this location), a city adjacent to New Haven. He viewed this several times as he was driving, then he started to look for an area to pull over and watch the object. He parked to the side of the highway, but then the object was no longer visible."],"Date of the Event":"09/20/2010 05:30 UTC","Region":"Connecticut","Log Number":"US-09272010-0013","City":"New Haven","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Almond shaped light"}
