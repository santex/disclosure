{"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/15/2012 09:45 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsJune 15, 2012 ��� Observation location is about 16 miles south of San Antonio, Texas on Highway 16 South. We did not have a GPS available but the Latitude and Longitude is close to this: 29.191807,-98.583584. This observation started at 9:45 PM Central Time and lasted until 12:05 AM. We used Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) and Meade Instruments Refractor Telescope. We are facing south and looking almost straight up to Saturn at 75 to 80 degrees from ground level. You will need to start looking at the lower left side of Saturn as it is in the night sky at 9:45 PM. The object comes active just after a commercial airliner passes from the north and flies south towards Laredo, Texas though the southern corridor. I have not been able to see the object before 9:45 PM but what you are looking for is a small flash of light. Under unaided eyesight, the small flash of light is about two to four times the size of Saturn. With the NVG, you can see it clear and see the object flash out into space as well as flash towards Earth. We have timed the intervals between flashes at 28 to 33 seconds under unaided conditions. With the telescope, we can see the object flash its light down to Earth and in between the downward flash, the object flashes out into space. We have verified the object is in a Geosynchronous orbit directly above the San Antonio���s air traffic controlled southern corridor however, at this time we have not contacted the ATC nor NASA for any kind of confirmation. Web research states if this object is a real satellite in (GEO) orbit, it should be 35,786 km (22,000 miles) above us. If it is a satellite, why does it flash a light so bright from 22,000 miles up? Anyway, if you get a chance on a clear, moonless night, look up and see something cool."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"San Antonio","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There was one other sighting in San Antonio on or around June 15th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"06/16/2012 04:44 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.341561,+-98.620114(39382)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39382) map </A>","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39382.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39382.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"29.341561","Log Number":"US-06162012-0003","Object Shape":"Flash","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"39382","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-98.620114","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"South San Antonio Nightly Sighting Anyone Can Witness"}
