Then I noticed a cigar shaped object just sitting in the sky about as high as the clouds, I stop a waited for the object to move but it just sit there for about ten minutes, then the object started to move forward very slowly, that's when I noticed what appeared to be windows or port holes along the sides,no wings or tail rutter's, just a cigar shape, round on both ends, at first I wanted to believe that it may be a blimp or something, but I've seen blimps all my life and I've never seen one that high in the sky, this object was at the same height as the lowest clouds on a clear and bright morning, It went into a small cloud and I waited for it to come out the other side, but it never did, I waited for about ten minute but it never came from behind the cloud."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.763653,+-95.3618(10785)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10785) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/10/2008 06:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-05172008-0008","Object Features":"Window(s)","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","Summary":"Going to work one morning and decided to check the mail first, look up and saw cigar shape object just sitting in the sky.","Latitude":"29.763653","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:20:13","City":"Houston","Tags":"City"}
