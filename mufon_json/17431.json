At 12:30 I saw a large what I thought to be airplane moving from over the western horizon flying to the east. It had very bright flickering lights that caught my eye. At first sight I assumed airplane and didn't even really flinch. But after a few moments I didn't hear anything and the lights were definitely flickering not like a planes would and not in a real definable manner, as if they were randomly placed and had the appearance of making this a very large object. I turned on my video camera, Sony HI8 Handy Cam model CCD-TRV65. I had the exposure turned all the way up and manual zoom on. I have about 3 minutes of this object moving from one end of the horizon to the other. As soon as I figure out how to transfer video from a 8MM tape to my PC I will submit it. Please if anyone knows how to get this video onto a PC please contact me.
