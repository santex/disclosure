{"Longitude":"-94.862879","Case Number":"43810","Region":"Iowa","divs":["Sighting DetailsObject was first observed out the east window of our living room. What we observed was a fireball type object with red center and orange exterior in the eastern sky. Object traveled in what appeared to be low Earth orbit moving from east to northeast leaving no trail as a comit would. We also have observed many ISS flyovers and this object was many times brighter, larger, and a different color, and also moved slightly faster. (note: there was no ISS flyovers scheduled to be visible from our location that night). Our location is also within aprox 100 miles of a USAF base. We have observed many fighter planes doing practice manovers and firing flares at night, and have also observed what appears to be drones during the day. The object we observed was nothing like we have ever witnessed. The object traveled in a straight path and disapeared over the northeast horizon."],"Summary":"Red/Orange fireball in low Earth orbit.","Date of the Event":"11/08/2012 07:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/10/2012 02:11 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-11102012-0005","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","City":"Carroll","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43810.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43810.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Latitude":"42.073274","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Carroll","There was one other sighting in Carroll on or around November 8th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.073274,+-94.862879(43810)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43810) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
