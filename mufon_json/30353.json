I saw first a bright flash of circular white light about the size of a 50 cent piece if you held it up at the sky, followed by a second flash at a 45 degree agle slightly below the first one. It was in the NE sky. This was different than any shooting star I've seen. There was no tail and no sound. I have no idea what it was, but I haven't seen anything like it before."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-120.305649","City":"Wenatchee","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"30353"}
