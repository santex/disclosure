{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI went to boot camp class that is held outside at Discovery park in Gilbert AZ and we started off at 5:30am doing planks than turned over to do sit ups and she was telling us to look up at the stars so we did not hurt our necks and I saw this dim light moving very fast towards us about the same distance as you would see a plane and than stopped to the left of me and moved slowly towards the right and stopped again and set there for about 2 min than shot off above our heads at a high rate of speed and disappeared in front of my eyes. I lost track of my class because I could not take my eyes off of the object."],"Region":"Arizona","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"43491","Longitude":"-112.068747","City":"Phoenix","Summary":"At boot camp at 5:30 am doing sit ups out side, saw shape flying in sky moving very fast than stopped mid air, moved slowly to the right stayed for 2 min than took off very fast to the SE and disappeared","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around October 23rd 2012"],"Latitude":"33.456377","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"10/24/2012 12:24 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43491.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43491.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/23/2012 05:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:01","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10242012-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.456377,+-112.068747(43491)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43491) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like"}
