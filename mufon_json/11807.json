So it looked like it could be a solid object...but showed no edges or anything.I could see it had no end to the length...5 miles...50 miles..circle the earth? 10 to 15 cars pulled over to just stare at the object.Now if it was a rare weather sight,would'nt it be looking angled a little,and not able to hold these swirling storm clouds at bay,until 15 minutes later,when the clouds did slowly fill it in...or did the black thing raise up and leave?I told another man standing there:Maybe the old man is coming down.He said:maybe...my heart was pounding wondering what was happening,is this the end?All the people were relieved when the clouds slowly filled it in,and left.I wish I got the others who stopped,because it acted like a solid object...not a perfectly split sky and atmosphere...."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07292008-0011","Summary":"black...5-25 miles long...straight across the sky","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Vienna Township","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.180142,+-83.78364(11807)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11807) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.180142","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-83.78364","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/01/2005 02:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/01/2005 02:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"11807"}
