I looked to my right and noticed another shiny object that kind of reminded me of the plane on my left, leaving no contrail. I looked back at the first object and when I returned to the second it had gone missing. The sky appeared to have very few to no clouds that day, and the area of observable sky was very large for the apparent speed the object had. The object appeared to be proceeding in a north - north easterly direction in a steady rate of movement. Afterwards, I called my wife and told her about the incident. It was an interesting experience, but I am still not sure if what I saw was a UFO or some other explainable phenomenon."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"11020","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.044494,+-84.496486(11020)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11020) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11020.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11020.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/01/2008 06:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Lexington","There were no other sightings in Lexington on or around June 1st 2008"]}
