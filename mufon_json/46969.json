{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"46969","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsLast summer I was with my mother and son at Hackert Lake. While they were swimming I sat on the beach. During my sit on the beach I happened to look up at the sky and saw something that in my minds eye initially thought was a bi-plane. Upon looking at it longer I realized that if it was a bi-plane the wings would be thin and horizontal --- not cigar shaped. It just looked like a long light blue cigar shape flying in the sky with C shaped ends. I watched it's trajectory and when it came to the nearest cloud, it went behind and never came back out again. This cloud was relatively small too. I kept watching it to see it reappear and it didn't. The clouds were small and spread far apart."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Cigar shaped object over Hackert Lake","Date Submitted":"04/25/2013 04:11 UTC","Longitude":"-86.448253","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Ludington","There were no other sightings in Ludington on or around July 30th 2012"],"City":"Ludington","Region":"Michigan","Log Number":"US-04252013-0007","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46969.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46969.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.964882,+-86.448253(46969)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46969) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cigar","Latitude":"43.964882","Date of the Event":"07/30/2012 12:00 UTC"}
