Looking at sky. Saw orange star-like object. There were also planes in the area, but this was definitely not a plane. The orange light didn't blink, it was steady. It was high in the sky. The object then started moving strangely, sideways, back and forth, very quickly. It moved quickly in distance. It lowered itself in a huge empty field near the freeway. The light vanished and was replaced by a black perfect circle void. It was not dimensionally round, not a sphere, but rather it was a flat black circle, like a void of light. Driver also saw the light and then the landing. It was not a big thing. Not larger than a car."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/19/2013 10:15 UTC"}
