It was completely dark and I was looking to the north. I was looking into the sky for only about 20sec. and a object that looked small, rectangular in shape with a dim, flourescent green light all over it. At first instinct, I was startled from this object comming into my perrifrial vision. But I then immediatly figured it for a shooting star. And then instantly it confused me because I could not tell if this object was actually far out enough into space that it could be a shooting star. Or if this object was within the distance of a high flying bird or airplane. It came from the east and headed southwest, around the corner of my house. It moved fairly fast and its speed and movement reminded me of a low flying bird. I was confused on what it could be and I looked in its direction for about 15 minutes afterward without another sight."],"Longitude":"-90.179847","Latitude":"42.859997","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21235.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21235.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/30/2009 11:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply"}
