I have a clear view of Catalina Island. I heard boat slapping on the ocean and I saw the shape and did not recall seeing a boat like that so I snapped a couple of pictures. When I downloaded them I saw the black object behind the boat. I felt that the disc was chasing this boat. I don't know why but that is what I felt."],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00"}
