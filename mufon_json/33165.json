I went outside and witnessed an orange Orb, about 400 feet in the air passing over the neighborhood and heading slowly, silently in a south-southwesterly direction. The orb was approx. 50 in diameter and was translucent. As it passed over the city it dropped two other, smaller orbs and then all three moved out of sight range. They were very beautiful and since I expected to see something up in the sky, I watched them drift off into the night sky, wondering when I might have a chance to see them again."],"Log Number":"US-11062011-0006","Latitude":"44.042716","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Oregon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33165.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33165.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Springfield","There were no other sightings in Springfield on or around September 26th 2011"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.042716,+-122.957544(33165)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33165) map </A>"}
