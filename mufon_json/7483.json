{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was cleaning the pool on a nice sunny afternoon and noticed that the moon was really bright. I thought it would make a good picture with the moon shining on a sunny day instead of at night. Anyways I grabbed my camera and while it was turning on I could see this shiny object flying across the sky that didn't look like a normal plane, there were no wings, and it made a swishing sound. I got a picture of it and it was gone. I took some more pictures of the moon and later when I downloaded them to my computer, I noticed the object in another picture I took by the moon but it is quite high up and just looks like a spec."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Longitude":"-75.691753","Latitude":"45.42967","Summary":"I took a couple of pictures of an object flying across the sky with no wings.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-07202007-0007","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"7483","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/02/2004 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7483_submitter_file1__whatisit.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7483_submitter_file2__whatisit2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7483_submitter_file3__rick1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7483.html"],"Region":"Ontario","Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.42967,+-75.691753(7483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7483) map </A>","City":"Ottawa","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date of the Event":"06/02/2004 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Ottawa","There were no other sightings in Ottawa on or around June 2nd 2004","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
