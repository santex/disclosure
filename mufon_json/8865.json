I stopped & the light went out. My first thought was a chopper with a light on it but I looked out the window couldn't see or hear anything. Got out & looked & listened......nothing. My wife & I talked about it & she said when we get home to call the Sherif. I did that & filled out a report over the phone. I also asked if anyone else had reported anything and told he couldn't give out any info."],"Date of the Event":"01/18/1991 10:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-95.433615","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Iowa","Latitude":"43.443854","Summary":"Extreme bright light","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.443854,+-95.433615(8865)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8865) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01152008-0010","Case Number":"8865","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"01/18/1991 10:30 UTC"}
