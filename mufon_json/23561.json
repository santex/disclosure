{"Longitude":"-71.294687","divs":["sighting detailsit was the sunset i was at the top of a hill, i was gazing a lake. when i turned back, i spotted at low altitude a huge orange sphere of very bright light. i didn't know what it was, i moved sideways and the ball followed me. i felt pure energies of peace and joyce. the sphere seems to play with me by moving with me sideways. after about 20 minutes playing with the sphere in the field (the sphere was following me). i decided to leave the location. suddenly at lighting speed the sphere went with others stars in the sky and shine very bright and friendly orange color. the next days i looked on youtube, and someone in usa, pa filmed with a night vision camera a ufo that looks like what i saw.
