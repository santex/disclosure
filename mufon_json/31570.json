As I entered the on ramp and looked up and to the east I noticed what appeared to be an airplane making a landing approach in my direction. It was basically in front of me and to slightly to the right. As I drove down the on-ramp, I rolled my window down and looked out my passenger window and the object was not very far above may car as it made a very slow turn and I could not hear a thing. I turned the radio off as I was looking at the object and rolled the window down and the object never made a noise. I quicly drove to Sossaman the next intersection and you cannot go \"right on red\" so I had to sit there for a moment and when I found that object again it was considerably further to the south."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Mesa","There were no other sightings in Mesa on or around September 5th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"09/06/2011 01:40 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"09/05/2011 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"33.414964","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.414964,+-111.684599(31570)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31570) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
