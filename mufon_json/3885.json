(approximate) I a licensed radio operator and a trained weather spotter. On this evening I was outside to make weather observations while attempting to capture the intense lightning with my digital camera (Sony Cyber-shot DSC P-150). The camera is capable of 7.2 mega pixels but was set to 3.0 mega pixels when this picture was taken. All other settings were set to normal or default. While facing toward the southeast an object of light came into my field of vision on the left. I looked up and took one picture of three white lights (twice the size of an average star). The lights were in a triangular shape, 60 to 75 degrees above the horizon, and were moving toward the east-south east. The ceiling was between 1000k -2000k feet. The object was in view and passed silently overhead for about 10 seconds to 20 seconds before disappearing into the clouds."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"09/19/2005 10:30 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"3885","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.886874"}
