Then suddenly I saw a ship flyover me coming from the west and traveling east toward Binghamton NY. Theheight of the flight appeared to be between 200 to 300 ft above the hill I wason. My Larger dog became very curious. It appear that the craft had a shortfuselage and the wings were almost triangular. The total wing areas were lit upin a beige like light. Not normal for commercial aircraft. The speed of thecraft was slow. It appeared to be traveling under 100 mph. Craft of that sizewould have to travel faster even worth flaps down. I have remained very curiousabout this. There are 2 airports in close proximity, however, both were closedthat evening.Please contact me fpr more info. if you need me."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.098408,+-76.049368(1115)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1115) map </A>","Summary":"11:15 PM saw low flying object going east.","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New York","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Endicott","There were no other sightings in Endicott on or around March 25th 2001"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"03/25/2001 11:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","City":"Endicott","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1115.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1115.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1115.html"],"Log Number":"","Latitude":"42.098408"}
