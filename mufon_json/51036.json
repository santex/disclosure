When we first saw it it was above our tree line, but then dropped down and we were then looking at it through the trees. It was about 6am when we first noticed it. It was in the NE and looked to be over the Sandia Mountains in ABQ, NM. It was very bright and appeared to be round and defused along the outside rim of the circle. It didn't appear to have moved other then dropping down when we initially saw it. We called a friend who lives about a mile down the road and they were sitting outside watching it as well. We wrote it off as a weather balloon until we watched the news. We did try to photograph it with my phone but it didn't come out."],"Region":"New Mexico","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Los Lunas","There were no other sightings in Los Lunas on or around September 22nd 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"51036","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.809356,+-106.73068(51036)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51036) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/22/2013 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-106.73068","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.809356","Date Submitted":"09/24/2013 08:06 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Los Lunas","Summary":"When we first observed this bright light\" it was, from our vantage point, just above our tree line then dropped down and it was seen through the trees.
