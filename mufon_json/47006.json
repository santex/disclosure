I was looking up into the sky and that was when I saw this object. The sun was reflecting of the top of it and I saw a curved bottom. It hovered there, but not for very long. I covered my eyes but the glare was shining into them. At the time I thought it might have been a plane, but the object was too far south to heading for the airport. When I uncovered my eyes this whatever-it-was was gone. I never saw which way it went, but the sky seemed empty. Later, talking about it, my father said he never saw it. Because, he said, he was looking at the road because he was driving."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:10","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Richmond","There were no other sightings in Richmond on or around February 20th 1997"],"Longitude":"-123.127166","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"47006","Date Submitted":"04/26/2013 08:34 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-04262013-0017","Date of the Event":"02/20/1997 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"49.169085","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.169085,+-123.127166(47006)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47006) map </A>"}
