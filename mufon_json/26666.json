It was not visible with the naked eye, only with IR. As this single bright round ORB moved near me, I could see it���s eye or center iris open up then close and then reopen again when I paused the video on playback. This is not something you see everyday, even with an IR camera. I felt an intelligence radiate from it as it was looking at me sitting next to my 8 UFO cameras looking up, my 8 VCRs and monitors. This ORB visit was a little close for comfort but I love the adventure and whatever risk I am taking. Can this ORB be something other than an alien remote camera, probe or eye? Can it be from a spiritual dimension (maybe energy of a dead relative or pet saying hello to me). I do not have an answer, only the video footage. What does it mean to you?"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"San Francisco","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26666.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26666.html"],"Log Number":"US-11192010-0011","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.78242,+-122.415416(26666)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26666) map </A>","Summary":"Caught Orb looking at me with IR camera","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"None"}
