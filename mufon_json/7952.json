{"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"7952","divs":["sighting detailsi have been working on a feature film just off the blue ridge parkway near roanoke, virginia for a month. on tuesday night, september 18, 2007 i observed a seemingly very bright, multi-colored (green\\red\\blue) strobing (constant) aircraft on the wesern horizon over what appeared to be either the blue ridge mountains or near the town of vinton, va. distance was impossible to guage. the craft was far too bright to be a star i thought. then, a moment later, i noticed that the vehicle was not stationary, but instead was making erratic movements. these movements were both on a vertical plane as well as cricular and without reasoning. the movement was nearly constant, and without any patern. it would suddenly move up and down on the same vertical plane for several passes, then come to a stop. then it would move in semi-circles, sometimes changing directions immediately in opposite directions. movement was both minor as well as severe at points. because there was no way to tell how far away the craft was, i cannot judge the distances of these movements up down and around. i asked two other people sitting nearby to come verify what i was seeing and not only did they verify my observations, but spotted another vehicle which looked exactly the same, only this craft was much closer, appearing just over the top of a nearby set of trees. we all confirmed that the vehicles were emitting exactly the same colors and strobing patters and that both were making similar extreme movements. it was our collective opinions that known craft would be hard pressed to make such aerodynamic movements based upon our limited knowledge of modern aircraft. additionally, since we were situated away from the cities near the blue ridge parkway, we had a very unobstructed viewing given the lack of lights out there. these crafts rose proportionately to each other in the night sky over the course of the next three hours. then, last night (september 19, 2007) we observed the same aircraft, first on the wesern horizon again, then watched as two more identical vehicles appeared in a quasi-triangular spacing over the lower western horizon, again looking and acting the same way as the night before. they remained active again for several hours. i would like to say that i do not rule out military aircraft as i believe there is a base in the general area of roanoke, va. but i would hasten to add that although these may indeed be military, they were awfully brightly lit, which goes against accepted procedures for military aircraft lighting, strobing constantly as opposed to the expected flash lighting of commercial aircraft, and most importantly, were dead quiet (although range was again, impossible to determine) and demonstrated extremely severe maneuvers for conventional aircraft to make. if these craft were as far away as i suspect (5-15 miles) that would make the movements we observed extremely fast and covering the distance of perhaps miles in mere seconds, with dead stops and 180 degree countermovements producing in my opinion, excessive structural stress. again, if these were military, they are clearly testing anti-gravity matter devices. a few digital phtos were taken, not by myself however, and appear as an amber globe. t.a.b. rochester, wi"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.280971,+-79.896982(7952)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7952) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/19/2007 02:55 UTC","Log Number":"US-09202007-0007","Region":"Virginia","Sighting Duration":"03:00:00","Summary":"Multiple craft sightings for extended periods of time, all appearing the same, all exhibiting similar unnatural aerodynamics.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"37.280971","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Vinton","Longitude":"-79.896982","Date of the Event":"09/19/2007 02:55 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7952.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7952.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Vinton","There were no other sightings in Vinton on or around September 19th 2007"]}
