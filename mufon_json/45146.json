I really didn't know what this object was. I ran through my mind what it could be...couldn't have been a satellite. The shape was off. It also wasn't moving in any way. I eventually had to go inside, so naturally I lost sight of the object. Whatever it was, it put me in a sense of wonderment."],"Summary":"I just saw this sock shaped object in the sky. It could be a V shaped object. The angle could've deformed it a bit.","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Ephrata","There were no other sightings in Ephrata on or around October 15th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other"}
