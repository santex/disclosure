The sky was cloud free and the weather was calm. It was then followed by up to 20 or 25 more items of the same type, all of which appeared to travel together in a line from east to west where they seemed to vanish in the distance. They were extremely interesting in the way they looked and the way they traveled. They did not travel in a distinct formation, but appeared to be in a loose traveling group moving along fairly quickly. They appeared to hover, slow down, speed up and change direction at will, all while traveling in an east to west line. The event lasted about 5 to 10 minutes. They are unlike anything I've ever seen in the sky, night or day, at any previous time. They did not appear to be a group of airplanes or a meteor shower. I felt amazed then, and do now, and I can't wait to hear the explanation of the event because I'm sure I'll learn something new and interesting, whether the explanation involves the weather, the military, or whatever."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.180083,+-78.68476(32875)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32875) map </A>","Longitude":"-78.68476","City":"Lockport","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Lockport","There was one other sighting in Lockport on or around August 27th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"32875","Date Submitted":"10/25/2011 11:37 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/27/2011 08:50 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
