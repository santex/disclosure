{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsTwo bright objects in the sky, much brighter than any others, lined up, one almost directly over the other, and hung in the sky. The lower one seemed to move away and then back towards me repeatedly, sometimes disappearing behind cloud cover but other times the light was so bright it pierced through the clouds (or it was below the cloud cover.) The lights were so bright it seemed like tendrils were coming from it - those little spikes of light you get when looking at the sun. I got out my telescope and looked at it closely. I was able to gain no new details except that it looked round, a circle or sphere, and that it was many different colors. It seemed to flash or pulsate red and yellow and all the colors in between. It looked like it might have been spinning. The light very suddenly vanished and has not yet returned."],"Date of the Event":"11/29/2008 07:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.734652","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Two bright star like objects aligned over each other.
