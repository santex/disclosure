{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Keystone Heights","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife daughter and grandson were flying a kite when the wife noticed the object in the completely clear blue sky sitting stationary at what they said seemed to be a very high altitude. When the wife saw it at first it was horizontal.When she looked back at it after pointing it out to my daughter it was vertical. My daughter handily had a camera in hand and snapped one photo befor it dissapeared. They did not see it vannish. They just were unable to locate it again and assumed it was gone. Keep in mind it was windy enough to keep the kite aloft down here at ground level. Typicaly winds at the altitude where this object was seen are a lot stronger yet it was stationary for several mins."],"Latitude":"29.789927","Date Submitted":"02/26/2010 07:03 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Keystone Heights","There were no other sightings in Keystone Heights on or around February 26th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22020.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22020_submitter_file1__StationaryObject.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22020.html"],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Cylinder","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"22020","Summary":"Stationary elongated narrow middle.
