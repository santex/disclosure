Went out around 11:00 p.m. to smoke last cig. of the day. Looked east toward Great Divide and saw a bright light in the sky. Object was shaped like a cylinder and was amber colored. Tried to hear any noise but there was none. Object hovered in sky for a few minutes and started moving toward the south west. Color was solid except for a brighter band of light in the middle of object. Watched for about 10 to 15 minutes until it went behind a cloud. Came inside, made sure all doors and windows locked, turned off the lights and went to bed. ( This is the second time I have observed UFO's but did not think to report the first time. First time I observed objects there was actually 3 of them. Same shape as above described. There was one large object and 2 smaller ones. Watched them for about 10 minutes.This happened in Jan 2013.) Because of the altitude here the sky is usually very clear."],"Object Features":"None","Case Number":"46610","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.089337,+-105.93136(46610)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46610) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46610.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46610.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.089337","Region":"Colorado","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Granby","There were no other sightings in Granby on or around April 4th 2013"],"Longitude":"-105.93136","Log Number":"US-04052013-0014"}
