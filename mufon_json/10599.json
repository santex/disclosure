The Cesna was moving slowly from west to east back to my north. Then I noticed a white oblong object aproaching the small airplane maybe 500 feet higher. It was about a third the size of the plane. It passed right over the airplane and continued from north north east to south south west. Traveling at a high rate of speed. It made the light plane look like it was standing still. I ran inside and grabed my camera but when I got back outside I could no longer locate it. I took several pictures of the sky hopeing to get something but nothing showed up on the camera."]}
