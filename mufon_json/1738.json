{"divs":["Sighting Details I was on my land in Pine Meadow Ranches, lot 34near Pine Hill New Mexico. I was bed down outside on the ground and in the theopen. I was about to go to sleep when out of the corner of my eye I saw in theeast a light like it had just came on and quikcly got brighter and brighter.Ive never seen a light so bright in the sky before, it almost seem to light upthe area. It only lasted a couple seconds then became a small light, like astar, and began moving south in a very strange pattern. It jumped up and down,or zigzaged up and down rather dramtically. If the horizon were a yard stick Ionly saw this thing move for about 2 inches and then I could not see it anymore. The distance was about as far as one usually sees a satilite, but I haveseen satillites many times but never seen one move like this or have lightbehavior like this. It was erie.
