We observed the UFO as it began to move slightly up and down, left and right which we found odd. Over the next 20 minutes we pondered what it could be but it was very unique. It even changed in color to a Red light and purple at distance but predominantly stayed white and dimmed, blinked, and pulsates for a wry king time. After the movements became quite noticable we felt confused and there was fear a bit. It then proceeded to the distance and even appeard to disappear In a cloud of smoke before reappearing again and then descending below the tree horizon. After the event there were lots of helicopters directly over us with search lights on and was very disturbing for this small town."],"Log Number":"CA-05212012-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Minden","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Near horizon, looked like a star but then began moving, blinking, changing color, and strange deviation.","Date Submitted":"05/21/2012 12:25 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38323.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38323.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
