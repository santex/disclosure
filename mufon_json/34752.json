We were traveling westbound on 45 highway and then all of the sudden to the south of 45 highway there were two bright orange orbs in the sky above the tree line. One was still and the other orb was going around it in circles. I then proceeded to pull of the highway so my wife could take pictures of it and with the blink of an eye they were gone. Now I do know fort leavenworth is close to this area. Could it have been some military operation at night. I have no idea. All I know is I saw something last night and hopefully someone else saw the same thing."],"Log Number":"US-01092012-0018","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Orange orb in parkville missouri","City":"Parkville","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"39.197663","Date Submitted":"01/09/2012 05:46 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/08/2012 07:10 UTC"}
