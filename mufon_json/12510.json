We live a good bit away from the city so we have a decent view of the sky. We had already been outside for about an hour or so and were about to go back inside when I noticed a light straight up. I thought it was a meteor at first, but the light never went away. I thought that maybe it was a satellite, but after watching it for about 15 or 20 seconds it began to slow down and almost stop, then speed up again, going in a slight zig zag motion. This was when I noticed another light that was crossing paths with the first light. They were both very high up and looked like satellites do, but moved in strange paths. Neither of these lights were blinking at all, so there was no way they were planes. Shortly after the second light crossed paths with the first one, they both sped up considerably and disappeared from our view."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.58011,+-85.076611(12510)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12510) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/13/2007 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09172008-0005","Latitude":"33.58011","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Carrollton","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12510.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12510.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Georgia","Date Submitted":"08/13/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
