A friend of mine was over and we were enjoying the view. Suddenly one of us noticed a light emerge from behind the hill. Our first inclination was that it was an airplane. Being aviation buffs we both quickly noticed that it only had one light and that it was the wrong color. Then it quickly changed direction and Zig Zaged across the field and then across the river. It stopped about 5 feet in front of the window and we could see its reflection on the river when it had passed over it. It was about 5 ft in diameter and appeared to be made of glass. An amber colored light emanated from inside. I went to alert my dad who was trying to sleep and he told me to do the same. I returned to the living room in time to see it speed off up the river to the south. Then two smaller spheres one glowing blue and the other red came out from the deck orbiting each other and than retreated the same way. We were both shaken up and in awe."],"Date of the Event":"03/31/1989 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-106.984827","Summary":"5 ft diameter transparent sphere with amber colored light emanating from inside. zig zaged across a field, low to the ground , stopped in front of the window and than sped off towards the south.
