Before the UFO I spotted came into view the cellphone towers were completely dark. However when the UFO came it seemed to drop something on the 2 cellphone towers as it passed. The object was a flashing red light which flashed every second of the 5 seconds I saw the object. After it disappeared the red lights it deposited on the cellphone towers went out at the same time. At first I thought it was nothing until it started blinking red. I was going down stairs to get a drink but my sighting mentally disturbed me. I quickly returned to my room and have never forgotten those 5 seconds. I still am disturbed by my sighting and am wondering what was in the object and where it ended up. This was my first out of 2 UFO sightings. The second one was disturbing also. Now I am a believer!"],"Case Number":"48410","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.847679","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48410.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48410.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Leander","There were no other sightings in Leander on or around May 19th 2011"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
