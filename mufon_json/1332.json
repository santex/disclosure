We observed several airplanes go infront of the object from our perspective. A youngster had a video camera. Hezoomed in on it and noted it seemed to be a halo shape with a bright lightemminating from the top and bottem. Much like a gyroscope. As the airplanesmoved away, this object remained hovering.
