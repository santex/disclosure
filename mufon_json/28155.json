Elliot Park for EOG Resources. I went back to the trailer to use the restroom. Usually the area is lit from lights attached to a generator so water trucks can see to pump water into a pond. When I stepped out, I noticed 2 Star like objects moving in the clear sky. They were not blinking, flashing, or anything. They moved in perfect unison and a great speed. They were travelling North North East I believe. I watched them for about 2 min and they disappeared. While this was going on I also noticed a smaller and not as bright one moving pretty fast North west and crossed paths with the two star like objects. I tried to take a picture with my camera phone, but it was too dark. Any feedback appreciated."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/07/2011 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pine Township","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.042315","Summary":"2 Star like objects","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03082011-0002","Latitude":"40.639347","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28155.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28155.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
