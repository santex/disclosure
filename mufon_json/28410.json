Then the star looking object got bigger and turned all types of neon colors and it had what looked like a trail of colorful fire behind it and started shooting towards the ground. then the trail of fire went away and it looked like a ball that was about 4 times bigger than a star, but it was very colorful. like every neon color. then it started decending towards the ground and the trail of neon fire reappeared and it shot off towards the ground and dissapeared. it was near a bunch of factories and a smoke tower in grand rapids michigan. it all happened so fast but i heard my friend next to me say o my god and i knew she saw it too. then i started freaking out and hyperventalating and almost crying because i was just so in awe of what i just saw. there was no other explanation for it."],"Region":"Michigan","Country":"United States","City":"Grand Rapids","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were no other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around March 25th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.96552,+-85.661976(28410)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28410) map </A>","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Circle, Fireball, Star-like, Teardrop","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"28410","Latitude":"42.96552","Summary":"Saw UFO fly through air huver and then disapear and very colorful","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03262011-0003","Date Submitted":"03/26/2011 12:53 UTC","Longitude":"-85.661976"}
