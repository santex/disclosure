I turn to the east to wave to the on coming traffic and I notice something in the corner of my eye...... like a star. At first I thought, ok, it must be Venus, but then I noticed it was moving...... I emediatly stop dancing..... I watch as it goes behind a cloud....... I think to myself, maybe its an airolight or something.... but then it starts moving eraticly like a bug..... I then new it was not a conventional craft and started taking mental notes so I could report it later..... The craft moved NE and then E twards a incoming set of clouds..... then back again to NE. It grew fainter as it flew, giving me the impression that it was traviling away from me...... It was maybe a good, 10-20 miles away or so.... I didnt see a paticular shape or size, and as It flew I had to squint to keep staring at it..... At this time I realize that I am still on the clock, so I turn and continue dancing and when the flow of traffic was done, I turned back around and tried to see it where it was.... but it was gone.... then I noticed (eather the same, or a different one...) Another star like object almost above the mall that was right acrossed the street from me.... It was moving exactly the same and seemed to give chace to the other one..... Now I couldn't see the other one, so I don't know if it was another one or the same one, but this one was definatly brighter and closer.... One thought did cross my mind as I was watching these.... there were a lot of people out driving and yet I seem to be the only one who noticed it. I took notice of several people outside but no one was paying attention to it.... at least from what I saw..... keep in mind I was still on the clock and this stretch of time mind you, was only around 5 minutes.... I turned to wave at the other side so as not to lose my job, and when I turned back around they were gone..... No mater how hard I searched, or squinted, not one of them were in sight......"]}
