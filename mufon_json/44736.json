{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/22/2012 01:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Summary":"3 egg to cigar shaped objects in triangle formation in cloudless sky between Fitzgerald, GA & Tifton, GA on 12/22/2012.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fitzgerald","This sighting has never been favorited."],"divs":["sighting detailsmy family was enroute from fitzgerald, ga to tifton, ga on december 22, 2012 at approximately 1:30 pm. the radio began cutting out, so i leaned forward to change the station. i looked in the nw direction of the sky (i am not sure why, i just looked) and saw 3 egg to cigar shaped objects in triangle formation in the sky.they were whitish with a somewhat almost reflective glow. the sky was clear with no clouds. initially, even though they had an odd shape, i tried to reason to myself that they might be planes\\jets until i noticed there was no jet\\vapor trail. they didn't look like any weather balloons or other aircraft i have seen. i am a bit of a skeptic, so it took me a second or two to wrap my mind around what i was seeing and that it was not \"normal\" (as i have come to define \"normal\" in my lifetime). i told my husband to look and he saw the objects as well. we looked around for other objects or planes to compare it to and there was a plane\\jet south to southeast of the formation (which was continuing to move somewhat slowly northwest). the jet we saw had a vapor trail and was easily discernible from the other objects in the triangle formation. the objects in the formation were about 10 times larger (each of them was). my husband kept repeating that the formation was \"definitely not an aircraft or aircraft formation\" that he had ever seen. we were in awe, a little nervous, but not really frightened. however, we remained relatively calm. he served in the military for a number of years, so he has seen a lot of things. seeing this totally stumped him. we kept tracking the objects in the formation, & objects continued to move slowly northwest for about 10 minutes. and it seemed that they blinked and just disappeared."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44736.html"],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"12/23/2012 09:58 UTC","City":"Fitzgerald","Log Number":"US-12232012-0008","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"31.714908","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"44736","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-83.252654","Region":"Georgia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.714908,+-83.252654(44736)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44736) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
