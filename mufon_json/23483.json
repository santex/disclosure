{"Date of the Event":"05/26/2010 09:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.810138","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["sighting detailsthese events are reoccuring. the most recent was last night (5\\26\\10). the objects are white orbs. i know when the objects are in the sky by the sounds that you can hear inside my home. it is similar to a stationary jet, but not the same. it is a deeper rumble lasting for a longer period. when i first heard the noise about one year ago, i went outside to see what was making the noise i looked up and saw a oval circle of white orbs surrounding a larger red orb. the lights moved in a uniform pattern east to west at a consistant speed, not breaking the pattern. i tried hard to explain what i was seeing as i looked at the lights. at times i could hear a high pitch like a tuning instrument. i live in a subdivision and all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking. then soon the lights disperesed from the center red light and went in differnt directions. they moved so quickly that they streaked across the sky. the movements went on for a few minutes. the lights at times would blink and i could hear the tones at times. a little later i could hear what i knew was jets. i saw three jets coming from east or south east across the sky. when the jets approached, the lights seemed to drop from the sky as the jets flow by. with in minutes of the jets leaving the area, the lights lifted back up and left up into the sky. i still hear the rumbling and know that when i do that it is time to go outside and look into the sky. the lights return and you can see the white lights and i can not explain what i see any better than i can then. i have not seen the red orb again, but still see the white ones quite often. often the jets will still show up and fly the area after the lights are in the sky. sometimes there are a few of the lights sometimes several. the apperance always seems to set off the dogs in the neighborhood and the sound of the event is always present. i am not saying this is anything from another world, but i would like to know what it is. after the last event one of my dogs was so scared, she would not settle down and even stay in her room. just a little creepy!"],"Log Number":"US-05272010-0005","Case Number":"23483","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sandersville","There were no other sightings in Sandersville on or around May 26th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.981543,+-82.810138(23483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23483) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23483.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Sandersville","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Georgia","Date Submitted":"05/27/2010 07:28 UTC","Latitude":"32.981543","Country":"United States","Summary":"Multiple Orbs","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply"}
