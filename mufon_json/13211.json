On the evenings of October 15th, 16th, & 17th.... I witnessed this ORB shaped object hovering in the sky. I was having cigarette-breaks on my balcony at the time of all 3 sightings, each evening it was visible between the hours of 8:00P.M. & 10:00P.M., I never got in until 8:00PM, and each night I had to go to bed by 10:00PM (I wake at 4:00AM during the week), so for all I know they could have been in the sky for longer durations; but I can only testify to the 2-hour window mentioned above. Please \"open\" these pics with \"Window's Picture & Fax Viewer\", and then MAGNIFY them to the largest magnification possible. They look unnatural and freaky to me. PS- the 3rd Picture (Oct.17th) appeared as an ORB by eye visibility, but when I uploaded the pics to my computer, it looks like a \"cigar-shaped\" object. I figure either my hand holding the camera moved, or the object moved (or descended) while the camera was blocking my eyes."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"London","Object Shape":"Oval","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"02:59:59","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/15/2008 09:59 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"3 consecutive nights this ORB was visible, 1st 2 nights on West side, 3rd night was on West side","Region":"Ontario"}
