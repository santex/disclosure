The lights had the appearance of satellites, which I often see. However, I have never seen three lights traveling in a triangle pattern such as these. The object or objects appeared to be very high in the sky and moving steadily in what appeared to be a straight line. There was an airshow in the vicinity (Brunswick Naval Air Station) the previous weekend but I heard no engine noises and whatever these objects were, they did not have the appearance of aircraft. I see a lot of jets pass overhead but sooner or later you hear the noise and see the navigation lights. These lights appeared to be much higher and looked, as I noted, like satellites - just star-like specks of light moving at a steady, even pace. The formation, traveling with the \"point\" of the triangle leading the way, drifted till it reached the southwest horizon and then just disappeared over the horizon."],"Region":"Maine","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.100351,+-70.214776(12437)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12437) map </A>","Summary":"three lights with the appearance of satellites traveling in a triangle formation","Log Number":"US-09112008-0015","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/06/2008 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Lewiston","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"44.100351","Date of the Event":"09/06/2008 09:30 UTC"}
