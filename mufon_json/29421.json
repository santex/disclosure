{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my room watching TV and my dad ran inside, telling me to,\"Come look at this light!\" When he went out on the back porch to smoke a cigarette he noticed a light flying across the sky from the south.I ran outside and saw a fiery ball of light flying across the sky. It was incredibly close and completely silent. It was incredible to witness and made me feel rather melancholy. My view from the back porch became obscured as it flew beyond the surrounding trees, so I ran around to the front of my house and watched it from the street. I flew to the north, grew steadily smaller and eventually disappeared into the night sky."],"Tags":"City","City":"Bentonville","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Bentonville","There were no other sightings in Bentonville on or around June 6th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"29421","Latitude":"36.380114","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-94.199717","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Star-like","Summary":"fiery light flew across the sky - south to north east","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.380114,+-94.199717(29421)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29421) map </A>","Region":"Arkansas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/06/2011 01:37 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/06/2011 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06062011-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29421.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29421.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
