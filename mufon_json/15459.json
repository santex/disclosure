After five or six seconds it was right overhead. It appeared to have a warm, golden, orange glow. Couldn't see any features, looked like plasma. My husband saw the object also and we watched it go east and then disappear from view. We noticed that one of Christine Dickey's photos matched the object perfectly. Her photo will be attached to this report."],"Case Number":"15459"}
