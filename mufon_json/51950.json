I decided to go for a walk around the little lake in Bell Roth Park at approximately 10:00 PM. When I got to the East side of the lake, I noticed three orange-ish lights in the distance to the West South West. I watched the three lights doing aerial maneuvers for a short time then they looked like they were coming in my general direction. I was curious but not afraid. They got to, possibly, a couple of miles from me and made a sharp turn to the North like they were following Federal Blvd. toward Northglenn. I remember wondering if my mother, who lived up in that direction was up and watching the lights too. After a few moments, they came toward me again and stopped directly above where I was standing at the top of the berm by the lake. I became mildly alarmed when they started coming and by the time they got to me, I was terrified and began looking for a place to hide. I ran toward the childrens playground at the base of the berm. A bright white light shone down, then blinked off and then the lights were gone. When I got back home, my husband asked me where I'd been and told me that he'd walked around the lake at least three times looking for me. I was confused and felt like I'd been drugged."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-105.005018","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.855927,+-105.005018(51950)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51950) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/31/2013 02:11 UTC"}
