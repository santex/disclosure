My wife has always been the open minded skeptic of UFO's. That all changed today... She was on her way to work going East bound on Rollins Road just North of the small town of Third Lake IL. When she looked up she saw a chrome color metallic looking disc in the sky, it was close enough for her to freak out and almost ran her truck into a side ditch. She did not take her eye's off the object when all of the sudden it just disappeared. She describe it just like blinking out. I had my wife sketch some drawing of what she saw. I am including the sketch with this report."],"Latitude":"42.37391","Date Submitted":"04/27/2010 05:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.37391,+-88.010912(22997)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22997) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22997.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22997_submitter_file1__DayDiscSketch.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22997.html"]}
