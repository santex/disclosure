The objects then seemed to dissipate into the night air. We had no idea what they could've been. 5 minutes later, another barrage of 3 appeared and were heading in the same direction and also disappeared in the same spot as the first three. We pulled over and grabbed something to eat at Steak-n-Shake. I went outside just to take another look and eventually the whole crew and all the customers came outside and were staring at 5 of these things, flying in the same direction and disappearing at the same point as the ones before them. In all, we saw 16 of these aircrafts. I tried to take pictures, but though the objects appeared in my viewfinder, they did not show up in the photographs."],"Object Shape":"Cigar","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"16 bright glowing orange/red objects flying 3 at a time in a \"V\" formation that disappeared into sky","Log Number":"US-08032009-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18451.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18451.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"41.029726","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"18451","Longitude":"-80.659953","Date Submitted":"08/02/2009 09:55 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Boardman","There were no other sightings in Boardman on or around August 2nd 2009"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/02/2009 09:55 UTC"}
