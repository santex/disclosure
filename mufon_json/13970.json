We are in the Gig Harbor Wa, area. The light was brighter than a normal Airplane light. We heard no sounds. The odd thing was that the light started to fade gradually, then dissapear. The light was moving faster than a normal aircraft we have seen in our local area. My son stated that he reaquired the light and that it stopped in a stationary position in the sky. We watched that light for approx. 10 minutes without it moving."],"Date of the Event":"11/24/2008 06:30 UTC","City":"Gig Harbor"}
