It was as if the light was enclosed in glass and glowing inside and all around it. It didn't distract the shape of the craft as most bright lights do. No blinking lights, no sound, just the glow. I watched it for 3 to 4 minutes in amazement. It was traveling east. The plane I was watching previously was heading north and the object passed in front of it, the plane turned east afterwards as if to follow it. It didn't seem any bigger then a normal plane, and about the same distance up as normal aircraft would fly. It really is hard to determine distance at night though. As it was traveling through, the tree's did block my view at the end. I've never known an airplane to glow like that. I would love to know if anyone else has seen this."],"Date of the Event":"05/22/2008 09:58 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Bright Glowing Narrow Triangle silently gliding through night sky."}
