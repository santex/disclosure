The spheres where bright white and had no blinking lights. It was very high in the sky and above the normal airline traffic. It was too big to be a satellite and wasnt high enough to even be considered a satellite. The speed was 5x faster then the air traffic that I was observing. I immediately contacted an associate that lives on the other side of the city. He confirmed seeing the white sphere but had seen two of them moving in the same direction. I had limited visiblity of the sky due to tree obstructions and had not seen the second one."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.777346,+-86.155184(23952)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23952) map </A>","Tags":"City","Case Number":"23952","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
