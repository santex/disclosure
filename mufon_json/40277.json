{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:20 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing on the street outside my home, watching the neighborhood fireworks. It was around 10:00 - 10:30 pm PST. I was looking to the west and I saw 3 redish-orange objects in the sky at about 50-60 degrees up. They were traveling together (sort of V-type formation) and moving in a north to south direction. By the time I got 3 pictures and tried to get video, they all just slowly faded out of sight before my eyes. They weren't fireworks (that were going vertical), these were traveling horizontal. I got 3 pictures on my phone. They are a bit blurry, but you can see them in a sort of formation. I was sort of excited to see something like that. I didn't know if they were making sounds because of all the fireworks going off around me."],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 09:36 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.652769,+-122.68797(40277)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40277) map </A>","Longitude":"-122.68797","Case Number":"40277","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Washington","Summary":"3 steady redish-orange round objects in Western sky slow travel N-S direction","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"00:00:35","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"47.652769","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Silverdale","There were no other sightings in Silverdale on or around July 4th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Silverdale","Log Number":"US-07052012-0101","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40277.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/40277_submitter_file1__IMG0094.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/40277_submitter_file2__IMG0095.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/40277_submitter_file3__IMG0096.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40277.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
