There was what appeared to be something blocking out the bottom tip of the crescent moon. Further out from where the tip of the crescent moon would have extended was a white light. The obaque object \"sat\" staionary from the time I left my house to the time I got to work (approx. 30 minutes). I came back outside after the sun had come up with a coworker and it was gone. Never seen anything like it. That afternoon, there was an abundance of chemtrails also. Atleast 10-15. I attached a rendering of what I saw.
