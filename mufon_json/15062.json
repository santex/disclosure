I saw what I thought was the local blimp off in the distance hovering. As I got closer, it no longer appeared the be a blimp, but a metallic, cube like object with jagged protrusions. I was attempting to track it and drive. I was able to look at it off and on for about 3 minutes. As I got a bit closer I knew it was not a blimp nor a large suspended balloon. My eyes welded with tears out of disbelief. I also witnesses other people on the freeway looking up to try to see it. Eventually I lost track of it due to the direction of the freeway and never caught sight again."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/19/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15062.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15062.html"],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Square, Rectagular, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
