I sat there watching it and it lasted about 4 minutes or so, It was flashing all kinds of different lights and when it was going over I seen the tail flames like what a jet would give off but they were pinkish purple. Really weird.. It made a 70 degree turn like following a track and then turned back on to the direction it was heading in the first place. It was not a jet. It was way to close to the ground like 500 feet or less and it wasn't making that much noise... I didn't have a camera or anything with me or I would have had some REALLY good footage of it.. I could see it really clearly and it was NOT a jet.."],"Object Features":"Dome, Patterned Surface, Other","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"12/12/2012 06:17 UTC","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cone"}
