We felt that maybe this was part of the show but the light was so far out of the area that I don't believe Disney had anything to do with it."],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"48011","Longitude":"-81.402611","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.295406,+-81.402611(48011)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48011) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Summary":"bright light release three lights in triangle shape","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/24/2013 08:59 UTC"}
