We are avid sky watchers so I ran outside and saw that it was not a normal light in the sky so I ran back inside to grab my camera so I could video it. It was a very bright, fire-orange light that seemed to travel horizontally at first, and then it started to go up horizontally until it disappeared. It seemed cigar shaped and there were no flashers like airplanes have. The fire-orange light around it was very bright and was tons bigger than any stars in the sky. There was also no sound. We were very excited to see it. The video I got does not do it justice. It was way bigger than it shows and does not show the fire-orange light around it very well. Maybe with the technology you have access to you will see something."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/06/2011 02:46 UTC","City":"Missoula","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.873206,+-113.989728(30014)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30014) map </A>","Region":"Montana"}
