It was traveling from west to northeast and was behind the plane and lower. We watched it until they were both out of sight. we witnessed this through binoculars. Previously about two nights ago we witnessed a large blue white glowing object more oblong in shape crossing the sky at low altitude from the west to east. This object was so low it was close to the treetops. We have seen many unknown objects over the past few weeks that have unusual flight paths and are not a plane or helicopter. This has never happened before. We are experienced sky watchters and this is the first time this has occurred."],"Latitude":"36.933433","Case Number":"29581","Summary":"Orange Pink sphere low on the horizon trailed a plane across the sky"}
