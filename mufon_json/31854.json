I looked up and saw it flying below the cloud cover and observed it as a solid black cone like object with some kind of weird appendage on it. There were no blinking lights on it and after observing it flying in a northerly direction about 500 ft off the ground I got binoculars and looked at it. I watched it for a minute or more and it seemed to turn and fly out to sea. It vanished while we were watching it fly along about a quarter mile from the three of us. I have been an investigator and have seen 15 ufo's this didn't look like any of them. It did resemble one of the craft in Anthony Woods documentary. After the ufo disappeared there was still a lot of cloud cover. A jet appeared and began spraying chemtrails."],"Case Number":"31854","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"27.897733","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Indian Rocks Beach","There were no other sightings in Indian Rocks Beach on or around August 17th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Oval","Date of the Event":"08/17/2011 08:23 UTC"}
