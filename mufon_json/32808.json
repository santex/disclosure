The appearance of the craft seemed almost as if it was holographic,the lights were very dim on this craft almost as if being seen through cloud cover which there was not..I did not see this craft again or any other for the remainder of the early morning into next day.The size of the craft from as much as I can judge in the time I saw it was between 30- 50 feet wide...."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-10232011-0019"}
