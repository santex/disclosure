We were lying in a clearing surrounded by redwood trees, so our views of the horizons were obscured. It appeared from the left, flew in a straight line over our heads and disappeared on the right. It was much faster than an airplane, but much slower than a shooting star. It did not glow at all. At first I thought it might be large meteor, and I was was waiting for it explode into a fireball, but then I realized it was not glowing at all. It was brown, disc-shaped and had undefined edges. My friend exclaimed, \"Did you see that?!\" We discussed it but quickly dismissed it as unimportant. That was the weirdest part. We kind of thought it was a cool thing to experience, and we were glad that someone else was there to see it, but it just didn't seem to be that important of an event."]}
