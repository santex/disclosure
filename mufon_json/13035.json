It was pretty high up and was above the clouds so could only be spotted from air. It was glowing bright red and had a long trail and most strangely it didn't move at all. We continued to watch the object during the descent of the plane and it remained in its position and didn't move. (I went to take some photos on my iphone but was stopped by the damn stewardess for using a phone!)."],"Latitude":"-14.228004","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"13035","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13035.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13035.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"large metror like red flame object over brasillia seen from plane","Log Number":"BR-10142008-0001","Date Submitted":"10/13/2008 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-14.228004,+-51.91808(13035)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13035) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/13/2008 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Brasilia","There were no other sightings in Brasilia on or around October 13th 2008"],"Region":"","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cigar, Fireball"}
