I was talking with my husband and then right over my neighbors house I seen a small green light fall from the sky straight down. I waited for about 1 min. And then I turned to my husband and told him I just seen a small green light fall from the sky. He looked at me like I was crazy. I know what I saw. My husband and I got into our car and drove down the road to see if we could see anything. And of course there was nothing to be seen. The light I seen was light green it glowed kinda looked like a flare. It was falling downward. I never saw it again after driving back home."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"04/27/2012 12:19 UTC","Summary":"Small green light fail from sky","Country":"United States"}
