{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsokay mufon, one last chance to check out this reoccurring ufo phenomenon around westmoreland county... now that you're seeing multiple reports coming in referring to the bright balls of light in various colors of orange\\yellow\\amber\\white, solid or blinking\\pulsing, moving or hovering slowly, sometimes zipping off, sometimes dropping into treeline... all while silent. and now that you've had multiple reports from all over the place from those seeing these lights changing\\morphing\\shapeshifting into different shaped crafts of triangle, manta ray, square, rectangle and other shapes that are sometimes flashing like our aircraft, perhaps you'll pay attention. you need to actually order radar reports for these sightings before writing them off simply because they might display red\\white\\green lights that flash. never assume, they say. they don't show on radar, not even primary radar which shows even flocks of birds as hits. how do i know? well, i, unlike you guys, have ordered and received such an extensive report that confirms this. you can then make up several other excuses that they are \"secret military craft\" and are exempted from being displayed on radar reports to the public, or other \"test projects\" by companies testing their secret projects... lame. the military is not flying their \"secret\" crafts under 500 feet over populated areas, hovering over properties long enough for average citizens to film them and post the videos of them on youtube. especially in downtown moscow, russia - where a guy on youtube.com\\user\\olegen77 is filming the exact same stuff. the military has no need to hover in the sky like a big flickering candle flaming ball with mult-colored prism light, before changing into what looks like a regular aircraft. an army guy back from iraq saw some and said they aren't ours and can't explain them. there are no such fancy crafts around here, except the war bird helicopters fully armed to the teeth that are now flying around here patrolling for some reason. patrolling several of the areas i've mentioned and\\or filmed ufos over. coincidence? perhaps. police departments are easily called for the areas under these sightings. do it. they know if they've ordered search and rescue or are searching for a criminal. they know if a helicopter was ordered for lifeflight for an accident. i have called them after my sightings and they know nothing. the \"airplane on approach\" excuse is also lame. the videos show the same size diameter of light for several minutes, silently, before dimming down to be replaced by flashing lights and moving. this would require the 'plane' to be turning on a dime (which is, of course, impossible for a plane). and, of course, they don't show on radar. end of story. point out airports & analyze video all you want. radar reports and the fact that you can come in person and see them all you want, trumps all excuses. prior to \"instantly showing up bright in the sky\" part, with generation 3 nightvision, invisible, small, round thin bubble-like spheres can be detected - mostly blinking (nick-named \"blinkies\" or \"twinklers\"). they have no mass visible inside, until they expand (if they are going to expand-which in this state takes a really long time) or they decide to do the \"instant on\" bright ball of light thing. they can and do sometimes never morph, but go back to invisible to the naked eye state (but still visible to night vision and infrared). the ones that morph from that ball of light state have been seen to tranform into 5-6 different \"end\" resulting shaped crafts. the sizes range from small car size to 50-60 feet average. all seem to have the capability to further transform\\change size real-time while flying. where do they come from? at dusk (and continuing for 2-3 hours usually afterwards) a $323 military grade ir surveillance cam is sensitive enough and is the correct ir spectrum to see them drop from the sky like a meteor. they then zip around our wooded areas presumably to do a safety check of the area. then they settle in the trees to wait their 'turn'. the size averages between a soccer ball and beachball in diameter. i've never seen them sit on the ground. i've never seen these show up during periods of rain\\snow or even when rain\\snow is approaching close enough to dusk to arrive after. other people who have been observing their behavior since 2007 have come to the same conclusion about the weather. after several minutes, hours, or sometimes right away, one will travel to top or near top of treeline and \"power up\", glowing like an orange\\amber fireball in the woods. upon closer view it appears to be swirling plasma ball of energy--2-5 foot in diameter. upon rising slowly and clearing the treetops, they then usually brighten and enlarge in size, appearing much like a \"mini sun\" in appearance--gold\\white flickering many colors of the rainbow. this can last seconds or minutes--while hovering or while moving slowly. the light then dims down and is replaced by smaller craft (than the ball of light) which starts flashing similarly to our aircraft lighting--most often displaying false headlight-single or double. still silent at this point... still moving incredibly slow, like 5 mph usually, if that-but they frequently pick up speed. sometimes they never change, and continue either as a bright golden ball of light or dimmer orange-colored sphere. they usually take similar paths, night after night, in 2 different directions typically by my house. the \"blinkies\" are what was described in the latrobe, pa (westmoreland county) report of over 50 of them on december 10, 2009 by someone else (show them this video & i bet they'll say that's what they're seeing). they frequently accompany the larger transformed crafts and can be seen in others' videos as dim flashes by the larger bright orbs--even in the famous phoenix lights closer video in 1997. all blinkies can transform, i believe. i have filmed them going from in-the-sky fake plane to shrinking back down into an glowing amber\\orange orb hiding in the woods. i assume they zip back into space at that point. many white streaks of light have been seen by several people at high speed which we know to be them. dozen other locations not far from me with the same behavior. dozens of other states reporting the same behavior. dozens of other countries around the world with the same behavior. (names of others with video footage of same listed on my channel on youtube--too many filming orange ufos to list). the orange ufos are reported the most because of the lack of flashing lights. people seeing them suddenly start flashing are most likely confused at what they've seen & don't report them. however, more reports are coming in of the \"fake plane\" ufos because those seeing them in person can tell they are a) silent, b) too low for planes, c) planes don't hover and would fall from the sky at that low speed, d) helicopters are really loud, e) there just isn't something right about the lights (strangely 'sharp' or inconsistent), and f) they've seen them morph. why, you ask... because this particular type of ufo is flying around incognito. yeah, they don't particularly want to show off and do obvious \"tricks\" so that the military will come and shoot at them. they just seem to want to observe us and our communications systems, transporation systems, power generation & distribution systems, mining and probably just how we go about our daily lives. pretty much what we would want to check out if we found a new planet with life forms. this is all i know at this point. i don't know who's in them. i suspect larger ships are out in space sending these guys out. judging by the number of places reporting them, plus the estimate of how many there actually are not being noticed yet, that there must be thousands of them. you guys need to revise your \"chart of ufo types\" and ufo \"behavior\". although the famous pine bush, ny has had the same types reported going back to the early 1980's (pinebushufo.com), they have definitely increased in number. they were proven to produce a fake sound, as well (which doesn't vibrate the surroundings, usually). if you never heard of pine bush, you need to read up on it. the sightings are still frequent there as well. http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=kdihe0fride another good video of them in quebec, canada sucking off power lines: http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=nbx1mijzz8y again, quit blowing off reports until you get a radar report proving a man-made craft. i'm trying to keep you guys from looking like fools. don't blow off eugene in euclid\\lake erie, ohio. i've compared notes with him, seen his footage, and it looks\\sounds the same to me as what i'm seeing. yeah, i admit, when dealing with aliens pretending to be our aircraft, once in a while a real aircraft might show up and fool us, but hey, what the heck to you expect with technologically advanced civilizations faking like our aircraft? did you think they wouldn't be able to fool us earth-bound, fossil-fuel burning humans most of the time? gee, even our own government is developing holograms to fool our enemies... and we're obviously way behind these guys. so, here ya go. one last report from me. fresh enough for you to get a radar report on it. i'll provide the gps filming locations. the time on video files is off by 1 hour since it didn't reset for daylight savings time. have your investigator meet me on the next good weather night and i'll show him some in person with my $3300 generation 3 scope. march 19, 2010 - http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=ql0b1ouft3c oh yeah, another video with helicopter (military, i suspect) flying past 2 hovering in the sky: march 16, 2010 - http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=dwijvoj6mga and a long filming of tons of them in plum, pa on march 4, 2010: http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=c_dusv1tgns any conclusions drawn by you without the proof of a radar report will brand you guys a permanent joke. the world is watching - do it."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Irwin","There were no other sightings in Irwin on or around March 19th 2010"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Date of the Event":"03/19/2010 10:55 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-79.698715","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.333294,+-79.698715(22453)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22453) map </A>","City":"Irwin","Case Number":"22453","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22453.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22453.html"],"Summary":"Bright Hovering UFOs over Level Green & Irwin, PA than Morph/Transform","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-03232010-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.333294","Date Submitted":"03/23/2010 02:20 UTC"}
