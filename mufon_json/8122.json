I always watch for stuff like this. I was wondering why i never see a shooting star and thats when i saw it.It looked like a star. It was moving to fast to be a airplane and it was bigger than a air plane and it didnt have lights like air planes do. It couldnt have been a shooting star because it didnt have the trail behind it. It was moving real fast. I couldnt believe what i was seeing so i went to get my mom. When she and my sister came outside it was gone. When they went back in i saw it again. It was stopped the it went back the other way.I went to get my mom again and when she came back outside it was gone but they was a red glare coming from the mountain it looked like when you hold a flashlight straight up in the dark. Then when i got on the bus i asked my cousin who lives right beside if she saw it to and she said yes she told me the exact thing that i am telling you. I swear to you im not lying nowone believes me but i and god knows what i saw."],"Summary":"it was moving slow the speeded up,stopped,and shot back in the opposite direction","Sighting Duration":"00:03:14","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Logan","There were no other sightings in Logan on or around September 28th 2007"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8122.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8122.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.848715,+-81.993458(8122)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8122) map </A>","City":"Logan","Date of the Event":"09/28/2007 06:25 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/28/2007 06:25 UTC","Latitude":"37.848715","Disposition":"Unknown"}
