{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was living in the fench area on a dead end road in the middle of the wood of arkansas....i was up and doing something and i thought to look out our bedroom window like i would always do for no other reason than a habit and sometimes seen animals at night. wen i looked out i looked to the right and up our drive to the road and then to my left i seen wat i thought for a split second someone coming from beside and or behind our house that only lasted a second the thing i saw was all black from the waist down seem to be tall about 7 feet but what makes it so unbeliveble the head of it was all white no eyes nose mouth chin no neck that i can remeber really almost like it just sat on its shoulders the head was round but egg shaped also no and it seemed to glow but it wasn't giving off and light to anything around it like a light would but it was glowing bright. it walked from the side, corner of the house and started up the drive wich is about 30 to 40 yards long it walked at a normal pace and i viewed it for about 30 good seconds with no obstruction of view eyes glued on it in amasment at wat i was seeing when it got halfway up the drive there is a huge old tree in the middle seperating the drive once it reached the tree it walked past on the side i couldn't see it just was gone i then tried to get a differnt angle to see if it had took a turn and i just couldn't see it walking in a differnt direction but it was gone i dont understand wat i seen and would realy like to know it you might could give me an answer would love to hear something about it thankyou.....i dont want attention and nothing else just want to know if anyone knows what it might have been and why was it around my house in the middle of no where. very scary"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Paragould","There were no other sightings in Paragould on or around August 17th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28127.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28127.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/06/2011 07:26 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"28127","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.061462,+-90.493469(28127)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28127) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Arkansas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/17/2008 10:01 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Paragould","Longitude":"-90.493469","Summary":"was not ufo was a being of some kind","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"36.061462","Log Number":"US-03062011-0002"}
