{"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","divs":["sighting detailspossible \"ufo base\" in eastern oregon. on a military watchdog website i read that boeing operates a generally secret drone or cruise missile test facility in morrow county in eastern oregon. the facility is located on the \"officially\" decommissioned boardman bombing range located just south of the columbia river, about 140 miles east of portland, oregon. also, some years earlier i had seen an unknown object fly directly in front of me at very close range, then making abrupt changes in height, when i was driving perhaps 50 miles south of the range. i believe whatever is going on at this test facility may have some relationship to ufo sightings in the region. remember, boeing is largest aerospace contractor to the us department of defense. it makes cruise missiles, surveillance drones, and it is anyone���s' guess whatever undeclared things that fly. note the number of sightings in the portland, oregon area that are low altitude flying objects which exit the metro area *flying toward the east* toward the western mouth of the columbia river gorge, in the direction of the boardman range. the facility and its runway are easily found on google earth. look for a large rectangular land area of brown \"scorched earth\" to the south of the columbia river, west of pendleton, oregon. the coordinates are lat. 45.747927 longitude -119.801855. the buildings and storage areas seem to be sort of camouflaged, as if this were a crop duster strip. not exactly, a storage area at the eastern end of the 1 mile runway is on a track and apparently can be moved. and the radar tracking dishes on the west end of the runway near the cluster of buildings. i am with jacques valle in guessing that most ufos are a form of psychic-physical phenomena, earth-based, of the types seen for thousands of years, whose appearance indicates far advanced technology. therefore i think it possible that some recent, clearly ufo sightings in oregon and washington are actually some advanced boeing flying craft, such as drones, weaponless cruise missile, or other test craft that are flown out this remote facility. if so, it���s anyone���s' guess how boeing acquired such advanced technology. most of the range is quite remote and well off main roads - it was regularly for bombing practice during world war ii, and although \"officially\" decommissioned for a number of years, local ranchers say that is not the case. fighter aircraft from naval air station whidbey island, located in northwest washington state, are said to do training runs over the range; presumably air national guard bases in portland and pendleton, oregon, and boise, idaho use it too. fwiw, a few years ago two advanced fighter aircraft collided over the columbia river, not far from the range. i think it possible that boeing is currently testing some sort of advanced propulsion drone. it appears as a yellow-white oblong light, or amber colored or white globe, the size of a van. these have been seen at night running at low altitude over portland this spring and summer, 2009. it is a bright light, with no running lights, no sound, and no wings or fuselage can be seen. several witnesses report them leaving the areas going east. something interesting in my own experience, which has a relationship to ufo sightings. it was in the mid 1980s, in the morning, just east of kimberly, oregon. kimberly is basically a gas station and it is located almost directly south of the boardman range. my wife and i were driving east. what looked to be a torpedo, or very small jet crossed over the road, perhaps 150 feet ahead of us, 100 feet off the road. trees shaded the road ahead of the object and the sun was not in our eyes. the craft just popped into view in front of us and i slammed on the brakes. it flew rather slowly at maybe 50 miles per hours per hour. at first i thought it was a rocket or missile, and then someone's radio-controlled experiments, but it was flying right above the ground surface under very tight control. it was apparently made of a shiny metal; it had a short tail structure and very short, right-angle, stubby wing-like appendages. it had an opening in the back, which looked like a jet exhaust, but saw no cowling for a jet engine. it seemed too small for a pilot, in fact here was no see no cockpit or window. i also considered that it was some kind of new \"shoot-em-down\" practice drone used over the pacific. it never occurred to me to consider it a ufo, but it was certainly of unknown origin to me. based on the design of a video of a cruise missile i saw during the first iraq war, this thing could have been an experimental design. but it was more like a rocket tube or guided bomb than the cruise missiles or surveillance drones i have seen - those have actual wings and taller tail structures and obvious engines. still, i would put my money on it being a flying military weapon of some sort because i recently found out about the boeing test facility at the boardman range. nevertheless.... that road we were on goes through an area of mountains and steep ravines. this craft had descended down off a steep slope at about 45 degrees immediately to the north of the road. it crossed the other side of the road at maybe 15 feet and kept diving at that angle right straight at a river that ran perhaps 150 feet below the road level and 500 feet off to the south. at about 50 feet above the river the thing sharply veered upward, leveled out for a moment, and appeared to be heading directly into a steep slope immediately on the south bank of the river, looking like a flying bomb. we expected that this craft would crash head on, and just watched. but when almost to the slope the thing snapped into a steep climb, exhaust started shooting out the apparent exhaust hole on the back. it was about 1\\4 mile away at this point, our window was down, but we heard no noise from it, we could hear the river. it accelerated over the ridgeline, clearing it by 10 to 20 feet, but at the top made an immediate steep bank downward and disappeared on the other side. the change in direction was abrupt, like a playground seesaw - we saw first the smooth top side of the body and in a second the smooth bottom side. we kept waiting for smoke to rise from the other side due its crashing. there was none, the thing did not reappear. google will clearly show a system of deep valleys that snake through hills and mountains between the boardman range and the region around kimberly. i bet boeing or the military makes these things, sends them out from boardman, and flies them down low, far into in the ravines making them totally \"under the radar���. food for thought and maybe someone in the dalles, hermiston, and pendleton oregon, or bingen and goldendale, washington can keep an eye out. who knows, maybe fighter pilots are running training missions around boardman, chasing some hot new design, practicing up for a chance to chase some ufo *not* made by a military contractor."],"Log Number":"US-07192009-0017","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Longitude":"-120.200876","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.716796,+-120.200876(18179)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18179) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18179.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18179_submitter_file1__BOEINGDRONETESTFACTILITYOREGONlat45.747927long-119.801855.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18179.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"18179","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Arlington","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Louvres, Wings","Summary":"Possible \"UFO BASE\" in Oregon .
