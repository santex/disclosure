There was a huge (bigger than any star, smaller than the moon)very bright flashing light, like a flash bulb, at about 60 degrees above horizon and about due east. It didn't change position. I watched it flash about 5 times and then called 2 of my sons to come out. It was beginning to flash with lower intensity. They both saw it, but were not very impressed, because they thought it must be a satellite and they are teenage cynics. It was much brighter than any airplane light, and not moving. My husband and I stayed outside watching and then the flashes grew farther apart and dimmer, and the object appeared to be moving up and to Northeast as it faded away completely."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.060244,+-70.829717(37712)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37712) map </A>","Summary":"Incredibly bright light hovered and flashed about every 5 secs then faded up","Date Submitted":"04/24/2012 03:10 UTC","Longitude":"-70.829717","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Date of the Event":"04/17/2012 10:24 UTC","Latitude":"42.060244","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04242012-0010","City":"Pembroke","Region":"Massachusetts","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
