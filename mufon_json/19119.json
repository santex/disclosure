First around sunset (I watch alot of sunsets at work); I noticed a high amount of plains flying around, even over known no fly zones. They were all flying in random directions, but remarkably resemble sweeping the air by grid. I Paid no heed to it, because it is an american holiday weekend (Labor Day). Anyway, going on... I went home that night and on one of my ciggorette breaks at 2033PST I saw a fireball that resembled the phenix lights almost directly to the west of me, and about 35deg high from horizon and never seemed to move. I was in my robe and my camera was in my car so i didn't take pictures (plus it was fairly far away). \"he fireball looked to change between 3 colors white, blue and orange. I had a cigorette about 45 minutes later and it was gone, with a new one about the same distance and height to the north with the same color changing properties. Still didn't move. Anyway at 1157PST I was going to bed with my window open and all of a sudden \"plane shaped\" lights appeared in my window not too far off the ground. It was not out of the ordinary for planes to be flying low (there is a small airport about 45mi to the south and down about 2000 ft into a valley). What struck me as odd was how i did not have any sound at all as it should have passed over my head. Alright, so I decided to call it a plane until it started hitting a treeline accross the street and two flashing lights (probably jet strobes) came rushing in from the west and the ignored craft seemed to hurry down past the trees. The Jet lights followed toward and disappered behind the trees. At this point I think that the \"triangle craft\" is just a plane, just a really slow one which would account for me not hearing the noise. Although what really troubles me is what happoned afterward. I was raised in a metropolitan area and have seen helicopters with spot lights follow cars and people in all types of areas. I saw a plane through my window flying northwardly around the 101 with a spot light pointed from the aft of the plane pointing upward doing slow sweeps around. This is when I knew everything was not normal about the evening. I ran outside, and by the time I got to the front the planes search light seemed to be off. The night was abnormally clear because of good winds that suddenly started around 1700PST that evening and it was a beautiful night. I would not suggest in investigating this claim unless others report seeing odd behavior as well. Oh, and I was texting someone in Atascedero and she saw the balls as well (but nothing else)"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/06/2009 10:33 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
