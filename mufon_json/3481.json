it was hovering above a small copse of trees some 300yards distance, as if unsure whether or not to continue. taking advantage of this situation, we conacted our control room and reported the facts of the previous few minutes. needless to say the response was one which generated every joke about little green men and space ships. all very amusing until the duty officer took over and told us, in no uncertain terms, that we were to remain where we were and not drive the patrol car. his tone of voice said it all - they thought we had been drinking! just then, we heard a roar and on turning round say the blazing object heading directly for us - we instinctively ducked and it passed over our heads with inches to spare. it stopped, turned towards the north and accelerated at an unbelievable speed, disappearing in seconds. dazed and somewhat confused, we became aware of the car radio churning out numerous reports by colleagues of the object as it travelled across the northern part of the county. before long, the duty officer, rather sheepishly, advised us to return to our base in wallsend and await instructions. this we gladly did and were eventually told to take the rest of the shift off. the weather conditions were: fine and dry. there was a moon and visability good early next morning we and a number of fellow officers were required to attend police headquarters where a number of senior officers were also present. the purpose being for us to be interviewed by two very high ranking air force officers. all very straightforward and congenial. \"thank you chaps for the information, very concise and informative. might be better not to make too much of or say anything about this incident, i sure you understand\"!!!! that was the end of things until a few months later when i had a occasion to talk with one of my officers who had been present on the evening in question. when asked what had been the outcome of the investigation we understood to have been conducted, his response was straightforward - the matter had been recorded as an official ufo sighting. i have two other sighting experiences, one as a police officer, again in the northumberland area and the second, as a civillian, in the suffolk area. i hope this is of use to you."],"City":"Chesterfield","Log Number":"","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
