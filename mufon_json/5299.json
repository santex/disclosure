Comox..and then it just disapeared! My son told me he saw the same light. he was 6 blocks south of me when he saw the same thing. i knew at the time i was watching a U.F.O. its not the first i have seen and i know it wont be my last! thanks for your website B.W.Broere"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.686944,+-124.992675(5299)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5299) map </A>","Log Number":"CA-08262006-0001","Summary":"a bright star like object came from the north-west and traveled overhead ab out a mile up and proceeded in an easterly directi on...appeared to slow down over C.F.B.
