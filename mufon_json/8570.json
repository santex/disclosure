{"divs":["sighting details i was in standing in driveway having a cigerette this was about 11:00 pm .i looked up and observed shooting star (white in color )streak across the star lit night sky from east to west.size was much bigger than back ground stars(like a big comet).i figured it to be a comet\\meteor.it crossed as fast as a normal comet and then just dissappeared like as if exiting the atmostsphere. any further to my west my view would be somewhat obstructed by a tree. but then from behind the tree beginning from same trajectory it dissapeared the light reappeared this time streaking a south trajectory and dissapeared. with a slight white yellow color.then it reappeared again for the third time now on a northwest trajectory.all three times it streaked as fast as one would see a comet .to the right of this activity i also observed two seperate green and white lights appear parrallel to each other to my west and make very short streaks westerly and disappear. there was 2 aircraft approaching on a southwest heading. i could hear they were jet aircraft.the jet's speed in comparison was like observing a small prop. plane moving across sky,nothing even close to to the speed of the light i witnessed .as clear a night as it was those two aircraft had a perfect view of what i witnessed.eventually more jets came in on same basic heading as the others.the first 2 planes were approaching at same time these events happened and were in close proximity.i have been witness to alot of meteor showers at night but none of multiple trajectory!.i never heard or read a report of anyone else spotting this that next day..the first part of sighting appeared from east from the big dipper and yellow star to west towards little dipper and dissapeared just past little dipper.[sky were clear,temp. 61 degrees,winds calm,humidity 88%,event between 11:00pm and 11:15pm dec.3,07.there is a bombing range east southeast of this location and im very used to watching military fighter craft do manuevers day and night.this is not that!could you check airport out of ocala to see if they monitered it on radar.municipal airport.thanks mike"],"Date of the Event":"12/03/2007 11:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","City":"Ocala","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"shooting star like with multiple trajectory.speed matching.white/yellow. 2 aircraft in vacinityclear sky /night","Longitude":"-82.133492","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.194109,+-82.133492(8570)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8570) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Star-like, Other, Unknown","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Ocala","There was one other sighting in Ocala on or around December 3rd 2007"],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8570.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8570.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/03/2007 11:15 UTC","Case Number":"8570","Latitude":"29.194109","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-12082007-0001"}
