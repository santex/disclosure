I was about 4 hours from Bogota,Colombia, in a small mountain village calle Villa de Leyva. On one of our tours, we stopped to take some pictures by this lake. I didn't notice that there was an object until I actually looked at the picture months later. It's an object that seems to be hovering above the mountains behind me. Upon seeing it for the first time in the photo, I felt that this was no airplane, helicopter, bird or spot on my lens. I was a bit surprised actually. Most people that I show the photo to are like \"wow...that looks like a ufo..\" What do you think? Some feedback? Thanks for your time."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-74.072453","Latitude":"4.607056","Log Number":"CO-04072008-0007","Tags":"City"}
