{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis will be the third sighting I've had in this area in under a year. I was looking up into the sky while assisting my husband while he worked on our neighbors roof. I was watching him on the roof when I spotted a reddish metallic orb fly over. My initial reaction was it's just a mylar balloon. As it flew overhead I noticed the orb's path was very straight, and was flying through the strong western wind we had that day. I got excited and shouted up to my husband to look up, I ran over to the side of the house he was on and shouted, \"Look up, Look up!\" I watched it until the treeline blocked my view of the sky. When my husband got down form the ladder he asked me what I was shouting about and when I told him he was upset that he missed another sighting in our own backyard."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Windy","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 02:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 02:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Longitude":"-73.988411","Summary":"Reddish orb moving across strong wind.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17865.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17865.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Case Number":"17865","Region":"New York","City":"Kingston","Latitude":"41.931007","Log Number":"US-07062009-0010","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Kingston","There were no other sightings in Kingston on or around July 4th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.931007,+-73.988411(17865)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17865) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States"}
