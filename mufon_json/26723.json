[first name removed cms\\dr] first noticed the light was just hanging in the sky and at the same time a plane was flying east to west and passed the light. after the plane passed a few seconds later the light seemed to fall. [first name removed cms\\dr] then called my wife to come see it because he thought it was a plane crashing. when my wife came out the light rose back up to it's previous level. i was called out at this time. we watched the light move back and forth and up and down for about 5 minutes. the light seemed to move in a circular fashion but it is hard to say for sure because of the distance and darkness. [first name removed cms\\dr] and myself were kind of excited but [spouse first name removed cms\\dr] was a bit spooked. the object eventually dropped out of sight beyond our view. [first name removed cms\\dr] and i both agreed the light seemed to move like a hang glider would but there doesn't seem to be a place for someone to hang glide at that altitude."],"Latitude":"32.228443","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/23/2010 10:54 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There was one other sighting in Tucson on or around November 23rd 2010"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.228443,+-110.922609(26723)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26723) map </A>","Case Number":"26723","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-110.922609","Region":"Arizona"}
