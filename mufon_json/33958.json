(Looked at the clock in the car.) There were 2 bright white lights and 1 red light flying very fast and very low from left to right. They were in front of the mountains. The red light and one white light blinked and disappeared, and the remaining white light quickly stopped and stayed in one place for at least a full minute. I had to turn off the highway, so I don't know how long it stayed in that position after it was out of my sight."],"Region":"Arizona"}
