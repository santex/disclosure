On the night of this video, I notice a strange formation of clouds that looked like a mushroom with high activitiy of lighting. In the bottom of this cloud i notice a strange light which I thought it was a reflection on my glasses, I started recording from my iphone and notice that the light moved and abruptly flew changing directions to the left of the screen and vanishing, but after reviewing the footage we notice it was something different. (The sighting in the file i'm sending happens at the begining of the footage)."],"Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Punta Gorda","There were no other sightings in Punta Gorda on or around July 21st 2012"],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Case Number":"40979","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Punta Gorda","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.985329,+-82.014554(40979)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40979) map </A>","Latitude":"26.985329","Date of the Event":"07/21/2012 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"07/21/2012 06:23 UTC","Summary":"Starlike","Country":"United States"}
