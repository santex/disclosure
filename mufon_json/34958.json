It morphed into two and then three. All I could do was just stare at it. Gave me that feeling like when I was a little kid and I just saw something freaky. They only lasted about ten seconds. but the last thing they did was like chase each other in a circle. It was bizarre. Further more, after we got home we went back outside to see if we could see it again. There must have been several planes flying crossing flight paths and a distinct sound of a jet flying low. Ive been hearing this a lot in the past week or two. We decided to get on google maps and see if we could pin point where exactly we saw the lights. From where we were they were in the direction of the Adirondack Mountains. Weird stuff, certainly changed my view on things."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-74.659351","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Nicholville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01192012-0009","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New York","City":"Nicholville","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34958.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34958.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Other","Summary":"Set of glowing orbs moving randomly in the sky."}
