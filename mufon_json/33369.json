I was looking out my window and saw what looked like a black disc flying through dark clouds. It was very hard to see for it was very flat looking. It was moving much quicker then an airplane but slow enough for me to watch it for about 2 minutes. When I saw it pass in front of a white cloud I gasped! The size of it was much bigger then I had thought! It looked about as long as a good sized parking lot! All I could see was the edge so I couldn't tell if it was a disc or a cigar shaped craft. The size of it was just shocking! It was so quiet and so quick and so jaw dropping! It came from the north and traveled across the sky towards the east and disappeared into the clouds on the east side. I live right next to Hampden, right on the edge of Denver, did anyone else see this??"],"Case Number":"33369","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.70874,+-105.075873(33369)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33369) map </A>"}
