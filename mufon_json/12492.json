It was in the middle of the night, I was in my bed asleep. When I was woken up by a loud noise a whirling sound like a vacuum. I looked out my bedroom window - the leaves in the tree tops where moving and I saw a huge disc with about 10 white lights on the front bottom half of this thing moving just above the trees. It went right over our house. Scared the crap out of me. I jumped back into bed & put the covers over my head. Told my mom the next day, she wouldn't believe me ,told me it must have been a airplane. It was no airplane! & it moved to slow. It was a DISC! with LIGHTS!"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09162008-0005","Source":"MUFON"}
