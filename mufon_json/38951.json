I stood and watched as a brightly glowing (several times brighter than a full Venus) brilliant ball of pure white light passed above and a little south of me on a gently curving east north east trajectory. I watched for a few minutes as it traveled completely silently above me and into the distance. It was moving relatively slowly as it remained in my view for about 7 minutes I knocked on the patio door and my wife and son came out and watched it with me. My son commented on the slightly zig zag or wavering motion of the object as it grew gradually dimmer in the eastern sky. I saw a similar object about 10 days before this while leaving on my evening walk. I will do a seperate post for that sighting as the behavior of that object was different from this one."],"Region":"Nevada","City":"Yerington","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/07/2012 08:06 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
