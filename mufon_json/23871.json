{"Country":"United States","divs":["sighting detailsestimated-time: 01:45am, estimated-date: october 17, 2009, length: 7-10ft, width: 2-3ft, color: faded bluish florescent, altitude: 40-50ft facing north, movement: rotating clockwise, speed: 3-5 mph traveling to the east, weather: clear no wind or breeze. i had trouble sleeping the night of my sighting, so i decided to go outside and water the back lawn. i stepped out in the back patio and reached down to pick-up the water hose when i came back up i saw what at the moment i thought was a kite. i immediately concluded that the object was not a kite because it stopped moving but continued to rotate clock-wise. i stood and stared at the object to study its form, color, & shape. this was the (most obscure object) i have ever seen��� i also noticed that this object made absolutely no noise, and the most interesting aspect about it is its shape. the object looked like a vertebrae or back bone and has it rotated it seemed to be flexing in a cumbersome motion. the color was a faded florescent blue, and the light that it emitted was even throughout the entire shape and form of the object. the size could have been 7-10 ft long and 2-3ft in diameter. the distance was about 40-50ft above me and facing north towards the hollywood hills. i wanted to go get my camera that was sitting on my desk so i backed away from the object to my back door keeping my eyes on it so i don���t lose track of its position. i ran to my desk grabbed my camera and ran back out to my patio. the object was no-longer in its previous position, it had climbed vertically straight up at what i estimated to be 1-2 thousand ft. i turned off the lcd display on my camera to see if i can acquire it through the view finder. i could not see the object, but i snapped 4 succession pictures in the general direction of the object. i could still observe the object with the naked eye but could not see it through the camera. i continued to watch the object for about another minute ��� then it passed out of view completely. i then placed a call to the (lapd) to file a report. the officer who handled the call listened intently and asked me 1 or 2 questions, and then offered to send out a chopper that was in the area to see if they could intercept the object. i said go ahead but that i could not see the object anymore so it would be impossible for me to give any position of where it might be at that moment. the officer thanked me for calling and said that it was an interesting conversation and that if the object returns to call again immediately. i then called (mufon) but got no answer. after that night i had tried to make sense of what i had seen that night and the only explanation i can come up with is that it could (not) have been anything explained in conventional terms and it seemed to be under intelligent control because it stopped in mid-air almost at the exact moment i took notice of the object. it was like the object was watching me has i was watching the object. and when i returned outside this thing had traveled straight up vertically 1-2 thousand ft, from the point and position from where i left it to grab my camera. this was truly the most strangest sighting i have ever experienced��� i have had an abduction experience when i was 6 years old, and throughout my life i have had ufo sighting of all different types, but nothing like the 1 i had this night. estimated-time: 01:45am, estimated-date: october 17, 2009, length: 7-10ft, width: 2-3ft, color: faded bluish florescent, altitude: 40-50ft facing north, movement:

nothing like the 1 i had this night. i did a little research into this object and there was some video on youtube pertaining to a sighting that story musgrave the astronaut had videotaped from the space shuttle. here the youtube video link that will give some idea to what i witnessed: http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=jotdaxx1w2a the object i saw moved in the exact same way has the video clip of the story musgrave sightings. its form or shape hard to determine whether it���s the same object. but its movement is identical to my sighting. this sends chills up my spine when i think about it.
