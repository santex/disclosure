I looked up and saw 4 airplanes in the sky. Two to the north and two to the south. I was thinking about the people on board and where they were going. I looked back to the north at the two planes, which you could see smoke coming from the planes. Then a perfect metal orb came from the north moving crazy fast. No smoke no sound and very close. The sun was going down and hit the orb as it moved, it reflected the light and I saw it was a perfect metal orb. It moved so fast that it took about 4 to 5 seconds to move out of site. I was shocked to see this orb moving fast in a straight line while 4 planes were in the sky at the same time...crazy. this happened in Memphis indiana, Nov, 10th at 5:10pm."],"Log Number":"US-11102013-0010","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-85.756733","Case Number":"52158","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/10/2013 05:10 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"perfect metal orb, flying much faster than the planes in the sky with it. no smoke or sound.","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.304026,+-85.756733(52158)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52158) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/10/2013 06:41 UTC","City":"Clarksville","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Clarksville","There were no other sightings in Clarksville on or around November 10th 2013"],"Latitude":"38.304026"}
