It appeared to be about 5 or 6 kms away and about 2kms high. The object just kinda floated in the sky but would disappear and reappear in different locations.It was also fading and brightening as it did this. At one point it started to get extremely bright and my first thoughts were that something was about to happen, but it just went back to being dull again.This light did not appear to be a spacecraft, in my opinion it seemed to be alive by the way it moved around in the sky, it seemed like it knew I was lookin at it.Eventually the object dimmed out as it had been doing and never came back."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"CA-08262009-0016","Summary":"Intense ball of light","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.225366,+-98.199273(18897)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18897) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/18/2007 04:30 UTC","Longitude":"-98.199273","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.225366","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"None, Unknown","City":"Stephenville","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/18/2007 04:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Case Number":"18897"}
