I noticed jet planes in the sky at the same time and as a watcher for this for many years i know these were not any known aircraft, i have seen two other ufo's in my lifetime but only shared it with close friends only to be laughed at so finally watching the sky at night when I go out to smoke has proved that something is flying around up there, ours or thiers?"],"trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around January 5th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27262.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27262.html"],"City":"Denver","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-104.980133","Case Number":"27262","Date of the Event":"01/05/2011 07:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/05/2011 09:38 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"four or five faint balls of light crossed the sky in seconds,","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Colorado","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.743624,+-104.980133(27262)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27262) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
