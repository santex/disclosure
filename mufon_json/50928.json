In our front yard, my 17 year old was sitting on our porch and called us all out to see lights in the sky. 2. 9:35 PM 3. Did not know. 4. Bright orange pulsating orbs came in twos \"shooting up\" from the Western Horizon traveling East, and then arced over in a Southern line making a turn then disappearing (\"blinked out\").
