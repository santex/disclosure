It was a silvery white shiny color with a dark color nose and flying at a 45 degree angle down, but with the nose even with the craft, not nose-down. No wings or tail. It was an oval or cigar shape. There was no sound. The size was small but I could not tell the size - I am sure however that this was much smaller than a single engine small aircraft, more the size of a large model plane. There are no model airfields near this location. I would be surprised if no one else saw this."],"City":"Independence","Object Shape":"Cigar","Longitude":"-94.409997","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Log Number":"US-11232009-0009","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"11/23/2009 02:52 UTC"}
