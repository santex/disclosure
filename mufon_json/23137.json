I have been interested in the subject of UFOs ever since I picked up a paperback by Donald Keyhoe which had been shelved in the Science Fiction section of a bookstore in the 1970���s! I have never reported a UFO sighting before, nor seen one, except for a possible UAV sighting in fog over Cheshire Oaks retail park (a few miles from the British Aerospace plant at Warton) a few years ago. The sighting I am reporting here is more unusual and seems to conform to the ���black triangle��� type of vehicle which is frequently reported in recent years, and may be of interest to people researching the subject. Over recent nights (late April, early May 2010) at home I have noticed an orange light in the western sky after dark, corresponding to the common position of Venus and visible when other stars are not (due to street lighting). I should explain that my home is in a high-rise residential block in a town which is almost all low-rise buildings, so I have unobstructed views to the west over the Severn valley from the Malvern Hills to the Forest of Dean, and south over Cheltenham town centre to the nearby Cotswold escarpment. I assumed this object was either Mars, or Venus red-shifted due to the Icelandic volcanic dust in the atmosphere. We have certainly enjoyed some very red sunsets recently. At approximately 1:20am BST (0:20 GMT) on the May Bank Holiday Monday, 3 May 2010, I assumed I was looking at this same object from my kitchen window a few degrees above the horizon to the west when I thought I could perceive it to be a cluster of different coloured lights instead of a single source. I left my kitchen (which faces west) to retrieve a pair of small binoculars (15x21) and returned in time to see the object changing position or aspect. Through the binoculars I had difficulty keeping the image still but could distinguish a red strobe light and fixed white lights, with an occasional blue light also visible (possibly strobing or flashing occasionally). The object now appeared to be moving closer and slightly to my left heading for the centre of Cheltenham (which is just south of my location). As it moved it presented itself at an angle to me and I could see the red strobe light was centred on the underside of the object which now clearly had strong white lights at the front, throwing a beam or twin beams straight ahead, like landing lights or car headlights. Conditions were clear for visibility but the white beams illuminated moisture in the air immediately in front of the object as it was quite a cold night. The ���wing��� tips on either side of the object appeared to have small fixed white lights like navigation lights, which occasionally also showed blue and I think red lights at the same locations. These lights appeared unusual to me as I would expect a single fixed green (starboard) and red (port) navigation light to be visible on a light aircraft or the police helicopter, both of which are familiar sights in this area. Civil aircraft in the UK have a white strobe, so I thought this might be a military aircraft instead. I moved to another room to observe the object as it passed to the south side of my building over the centre of town and could clearly see the object was a large black triangle or delta shape. The height of the object was level with my apartment (sixth floor) and the top of the Cotswolds (1000ft elevation), and about the normal operating height of the police helicopter or lower. The lights observable at this time were the two wing tips or rear corners of the triangle which showed small fixed white lights and possibly a red one on the nearside (port) wing. The red strobe was larger and definitely in the centre underside. The trailing edge appeared to be a straight edge and slim, like the old Vulcan bomber and not like the B2 or F117. I opened the window at this point to see if any sound was being made by the object and could hear a low jet type of sound, receding as the object moved away over the Cotswold escarpment to the south-east. The sound level was similar to a wide-body jet going over at high altitude and not what you would expect from a large object at low level and certainly not enough to wake anyone up at this time of night. The object disappeared over the Cotswolds heading south east towards Oxfordshire and I got the impression it had made a turn over Cheltenham at about the time I switched rooms. I checked the time, which was 1:25am BST, so I estimate the duration of the sighting at approximately 5 minutes. The only military traffic we usually get here are the odd fast jet making a run to the bomb ranges in Wales and regular CH47 Chinook helicopter flights training pilots for Afghanistan. These are always in daytime and the Chinooks tend to come from the north and turn west over Cheltenham to ���box��� around Staverton airport and head back north again. So this sighting was definitely an unusual vehicle."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"23137","Tags":"City"}
