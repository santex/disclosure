I couldn't sleep and got out of bed and stood in the window and there it was. Triangle shaped, bright orange and kind of looked like a big triangle shaped slice of thick cheese. It just hovered there for about a minute and then slowly started moving. I watched it for another minute just moving slowly towards what is the Halifax bridge and then all of the sudden it just picked up speed and you could see the trail of light it moved so fast. I watched until I could see no longer. The next day on the radio they were talking about it and how dozens of people had witnessed it including a Halifax police officer. I know it was 9 years ago but I remember it like it was yesterday and will never forget how amazing it was."],"Summary":"Triangle shaped glowing bright orange","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"42384","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Halifax","There were no other sightings in Halifax on or around August 20th 2003"],"Date Submitted":"09/08/2012 02:28 UTC"}
