We thought they were part of the fireworks display, but they were moving away from the fireworks display and within 30 seconds the first one suddenly disappeared, then the second one disappeared and the third. They were identical in size, shape and color and totally separate from the fireworks display. My brother and I both saw them, and he suggested I report them to you. We were both very fascinated, and positive what we saw. They didn't change shape, and traveled in unison until they suddenly vanished as quickly as they had appeared. Our first thought was that they were watching, possibly thinking Earth was having a conflict (war) of some kind and they were \"scout\" ships, checking to see what all the explosions (fireworks) were. There was quite a large fireworks display that lasted approximately 2 hours. We watched the sky until about 2:00 AM and there was no recurrence of the event."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Richland","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
