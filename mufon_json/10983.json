When I saw 3 objects flying eraticly. They moved in ways that I have never seen. We stopped the car and stood on top of it. We both started praying outloud. \"God please protect us!\" I felt they were somehow threatening. So we prayed. It lasted maby 5 or 6 mi nuits. We got back in our car & went straight 2 my moms as she was closest. As soon as we opened the door she said, \"what happened 2 u!! U look like u seen a gohst!!\"As my mom requested I called Trou Duncan, our weatherman. Hee said if anything was reported or seen he would put it on the nights news. But no story. Iv'e tried 2 tell myself that theres a logical explanation but this experience has haunted me 4 yrs."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-96.768333","Region":"Texas"}
