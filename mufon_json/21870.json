I have never seen anything like this before. For about 6 mounths now i have noticed several strobing star or orb like objects over gainesville fl. One in particular that has not disapeared like others. This object is bright, brighter than any other star. More so than Sirus. Also it flashes red and blue and orange sometimes green. NOT an aircraft I see it every night when it's clear. For hours it sits there. Another thing is the light is not constant it dims out sometimes completely disapearing in front of me. Two days ago I was driving home and spotted it out my window and seemed like I was passing it. I could tell by the stars behind it that it was lower than stars. It was more like I drove around it. I have also seen an orange orb around the object. Please contact me I want the truth as much as you do."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21870.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21870.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Gainesville","There were no other sightings in Gainesville on or around February 9th 2010"],"Summary":"This is very important news. i have witnesses and evidence send someone asap!!! theres something in the eastern sky very bright. im 100% SURE NOT A STAR!","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"21870","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02132010-0002","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Star-like","Date Submitted":"02/13/2010 04:57 UTC","Latitude":"29.658364","Date of the Event":"02/09/2010 09:26 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Gainesville","Region":"Florida"}
