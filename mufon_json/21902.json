(they were low down underneath cloud cover) after the first flash from my camera they dimmed the pink\\red light down, then after the second flash they turned the light off completely and the black object seemed to increase in size, (maybe lowering altitude?) it hovered stationary for no more than 5 seconds, then began heading south in the oposite direction. i ran after it but lost sight of it after i went inside to grab my coat. a truelly memorable evening! i have footage of both crafts although the first one was the only one that turned out visible when i watched them back on the computer."],"Longitude":"-1.323114","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Newbury","There were no other sightings in Newbury on or around February 14th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"51.401409","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc, Square, Rectagular, Other","Log Number":"GB-02162010-0001","Case Number":"21902","Date of the Event":"02/14/2010 05:55 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"England"}
