At first I thought it was a balloon about six feet in diameter because it was completely silent about five hundred feet up and about five hundred feet east of my location but it was moving too fast for a balloon and when it abruptly made a ninety degree turn and accelerated I knew it was no balloon.It was amazing how quickly it speeded up never changing altitude only direction and was in view about ten seconds total before trees blocked my sight.I have lived near the MacDill AFB about a quater mile from main gate my entire life and I have seen every airplane the military admits to having but I have never seen anything like this object."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States"}
