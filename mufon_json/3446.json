There were only a few clouds in the sky and alot of \"stars\" to be seen. After about five minutes of sky watching, I realized that there were too many stars that appeared to be moving. I thought that it was only generalized to a few \"stars\", but after looking further, I realized what appeared to be @30 some stars that were moving. I thought they could be planes as I am on the flight pattern of Toledo airport, but there were also lights that definitely were planes. As I watched the star lights, they would stop, reverse and speed forward. I more I looked back across the sky, the more moving \"stars\" I saw. I was very freaky. I went inside. I am going back tonight if there are no clouds."],"Region":"Ohio","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3446.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3446.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.556996","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.556996,+-83.627157(3446)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3446) map </A>","Summary":"Not Provided","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.627157","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Perrysburg","There were no other sightings in Perrysburg on or around June 18th 2005"],"Log Number":"","Date of the Event":"06/18/2005 04:17 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/18/2005 04:17 UTC"}
