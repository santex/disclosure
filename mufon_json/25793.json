When I first notice them I was traveling down Holcomb bridge Rd. heading toward Jimmy Carter Blvd. I noticed them because they where traveling very close together almost side by side, the one on the right was slightly behind the plane on the left. As I continued to watch them it looked as though the plane on the right was trying to catch up with the plane on the left or possibly chasing it. I watch the plane on the right catch up with the other plane and they flew side by side at a very high rate of speed. I lost sight of them due to their speed and some trees! I drove past my turn to get an better look but they where gone! The planes had an odd dark haze outlining them. There has been several objects in the sky in this area in the past week!
