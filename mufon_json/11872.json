It was completely silent, so I noticed it wasn't anything man-made, such as a plane, helicopter, blimp, etc. I looked up quickly to see a star-like object give a flash of silver light so bright, I thought it was almost a miniature sun. It flew off into the clouds a second later and I couldn't find it."],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Chalfont","There was one other sighting in Chalfont on or around August 2nd 2008"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11872.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11872.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
