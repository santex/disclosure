I noticed this object while coming home from work. It appeared to be a disco ball or Kaleidoscope of colors. No start or stop to the colors, just a more or less melting of rainbow colors. Pitch black night, 45 degrees high, NE facing. 100% clear night. I live on the outskirts of town, pretty clear night overall. I thought the object was a plane, until i noticed that it didn't blink, but blur from color to color. I know that judging the distance, you cannot think that it is space bound, you can see too much detail with my weakest eye piece. A tad more powerful than a 10x50 bino. There is another one nightly that is NW same altitude and appearance. If I dont turn up tomorrow, you now know why."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-120.551601","Date of the Event":"08/09/2012 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41624.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41624.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"43.812533","Date Submitted":"08/10/2012 11:52 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
