We where able to see these objects in the clearing we had entered. We immediately stopped and begin watching the 2 stationary lights. The lights seemed to glow slightly red and orange. They then faded out one after the other at the same rate of speed. I can assure you, being former USAF Crash Rescue, they were not aircraft,flares, or any other normal objects. Nether of us were surprised about seeing the objects, we have witnessed a number of different unknown objects separately."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Summary":"2 stationary glowing fireballs 200 feet above treetops faded out one after the other.
