I thought it was a star or planet but research showed no star or planet to be in that area of the sky. It was VERY bright white. The first night I saw it I didn't tink much of it and thought it was a very bright star or planet. Then the second night I saw it I glanced up and noticed a red light was swirling around it intermittently. This is what caught my attention. I looked again and sure enough there was a red light along with the bright white light. I don't think any stars or planets were in that part of the sky that were that bright. It was REALLY bright - bright white and looked like 10 really bright stars put together. It was there for several nights in a row during the full moon to the left then never seen again after full moon ended."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/27/2008 12:00 UTC","City":"Philadelphia","Log Number":"US-03222008-0007","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10013.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10013.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10013.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/27/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"10013","Summary":"Bright white and red light to left of full moon","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.954155,+-75.161489(10013)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10013) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
