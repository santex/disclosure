I went outside to see for myself. I was paying attention to a bright star, which may be Venus but I am not positive. It was a bright star none the less. I realized there was a dim, white light moving in circles to the south of the bright star. I continued to watch the dim light until it exploded into a bright red flash, which then continued to rapidly flash the bright red color. It moved in small circles and went from left to right in the sky very fast. I love to watch the skies and have seen some things that I could not explain but nothing like this. I attempted to video record the event but it just does not show up properly with my video camera, possibly due to the age of the camera. Regardless, I felt compelled to contact MUFON as I believe this to be a UFO. Whether or alien or not, I have never seen anything like this in the skies above Michigan."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There has been one other sighting in St. Johns","There were no other sightings in St. Johns on or around April 2nd 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/03/2013 12:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"04/02/2013 11:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.972295,+-84.567696(46562)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46562) map </A>"}
