Tonight I went down Lone Mountain Ave to Rainbow Blvd which Is about 3 miles closer than I was last 3 nights to this object. It appeared for the fourth night in a row. It just suddenly appears out of nowhere. 1st Picture shows object above mountains were it first appears suddenly���. Aug 20, 21, 22 at 7:55, 7:53, 7:50 respectively and then tonight (Aug23) at 7:45pm. The sighting always lasts around 10 minutes +- 1 minute and it always does the same thing. Apears in a spot and slowly goes behind mountain in same spot. I am on the south west corner of Lone Mountain Ave and Rainbow looking west. I tried to use my 3x zoom but the power lines or something made my camera not focus so the pictures don���t do it justice but they will show exactly where it shows up in relation to the mountains. I did look with binoculars again and confirmed there were no strobe lights of any kind. It was a bright white disc shaped light. The second picture is a wide shot showing the whole mountain range west of North Las Vegas and the light descending down to the mountain, this picture will help any body interested know exactly were it was. I will not post on this object again unless it does something different since it could continue indefinatly���"],"Region":"Nevada","City":"North Las Vegas","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Summary":"Punctual, Bright White Disc shaped Light shows up right on schedual","Latitude":"36.208699","Object Shape":"Disc","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12194.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12194_submitter_file1__1st.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12194_submitter_file2__2nd.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12194.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/23/2008 07:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08242008-0004"}
