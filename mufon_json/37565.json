To long of a story to tell here... but craft communicated to us. We see mostly triangles, and this one (not a triangle) that communicated to us in the field. I have video of first contact (summer of 2011), but just lights show up on actual footage. I have seen them as close as under 30 feet... seen the pilot (humaniod) sitting in the front of the triangles. Much activity."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
