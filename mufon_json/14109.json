The vehicle was parked on the north side of Riverside Drive, facing west, in Ionia State Park. While changing my clothes and exchanging text messages with my father, regarding the days hunt, some motion caught my eye. In the south west a light the shape of a 4 pointed star was moving toward the north east. There were 2 quite bright stars in the direct area where I initially noticed the light. At first I thought that perhaps I had seen a satellite, or possibly even the space shuttle or space station, as there was no noise, the light was white with no color and seemed to me to be traveling quite rapidly. The point of the star shape at the leading edge did not appear to necessarily be the front point of any object that it might have been, as it did not always appear to be immediately pointed in the direction that the light was moving. It occurred to me as the light faded out of sight past the town that the stars all had halos around them, and the light did as well, but not until it was over the city and almost out of sight. It did not when it went past me. I was approximately 3 linear miles from the town of Ionia, and the object appeared to have the halo around it when it was over the town. I would estimate that the object was visible to me for about 45 seconds, and traveled roughly 6 to 7 miles in that time. The light was bright (it was the brightest object in the sky), clear, and well defined as it went past me. As I watched the light it occurred to me that I might be seeing a ���UFO���, I actually texted my father a message stating that I thought that I was seeing a UFO, and although I had my digital camera sitting in the vehicle, on the seat in front of me I did not take a picture. I thought that it would only be a white spot on a black background, and not helpful. I regret this. I have included a simple picture of the light that I saw. The point of the light that is longer was the leading point, and was about that much longer than the other points."],"City":"Ionia","Country":"United States","Case Number":"14109","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/24/2008 06:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO"}
