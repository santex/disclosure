I saw this and I carry a camera around with me most of the time. I pulled over and took these photos. There were a few others that pulled over also and was using cell phones to film it. It was there for about 20 sec's and then took off to the north and out of site. Funny part is that it was silent."],"Log Number":"US-05092011-0001","Summary":"Coming across bridge into Ohio I saw this over the I-470, I stopped and took a photo","Source":"MUFON","City":"Bellaire","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/02/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bellaire","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.016184,+-80.742305(29014)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29014) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"29014","Region":"Ohio","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29014.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29014_submitter_file1__OhioUFO2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29014_submitter_file2__OhioUFO.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29014.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/09/2011 01:56 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
