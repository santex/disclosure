It was very unusual as measured against stories in the press. It is a long story, and do not want to spend time on a narrative unless there is any interest. Myself, my wife, and our neighbor couple with 3 kids were taken. We lived in an isolated area. Let me know if a narrative of something that happened that long ago is of interest to you. We could not report this incident at the time because I worked on programming the fire control computers on the FBM subs. My security clearance was top secret as was my neighbor. Neither of us could talk about our work to each other. I never knew what he did at the base. We would both have lost our jobs by reporting this incident."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3527.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3527.html"]}
