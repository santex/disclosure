THE OBJECT APPEARED IN THE NW DIRECTION AT THAT TIME IT NEVER MOVED JUST A BIG BRIGHT LIGHT. ABOUT 2 MINS LATER A COMERCIAL PLANE FLEW UNDER IT. SO U COULD SEE THAT THE OBJECT WAS HUGE. NO PULSESATING LIGHTS JUST BRIGHT. MY FRIEND SAW IT ASWELL. I TRIED TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE OBJECT WITH MY CELL PHONE AND MY PHONE STARTED TO BLINK THAN SHUT OFF. IM A PROFESSINAL PHOTOGRAPHER I SPECIALIZE IN LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY. I ALSO NAVIGATED MY SAILBOAT OF THE COAST OF MEXICO FOR A YEAR TRAVELING. I KNOW THE POSITION OF THE STARS AND IT WAS NOT A STAR. IT WAS BELOW THE HORIZON AND WAS TO BIG AND TO CLOSE TO MY POSITION TO BE A STAR.ABOUT 13 MINS LATER I WENT OUTSIDE TO SEE IT AGAIN A THE OBJECT WAS GONE.BUT THE SAME STARS THAT WERE THERE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING WERE STILL THERE."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09292013-0011","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"None","Summary":"HUGE BRIGHT LITE ABOUT A QUATER THE SIZE OF FULL MOON 15 MINS LATER IT WAS GONE","Date Submitted":"09/29/2013 12:12 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.127778,+-95.223008(51168)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51168) map </A>"}
