In the picture provided, it struck me that ghost orbs can have striking similarities with UFO shapes. I noticed how the orbs seems to be aligned in a flying formation and had holes in the middle of them, much like the UFO video that NASA took of UFO's floating in orbit around the copper electrodynamic tether that was released from the shuttle after the experiment years ago. I was wondering if these ghost orbs have any connection with UFO's? Instead of photographing ghost orbs, are we actually seeing UFO's capture by our camera? I was wondering if anyone else out there has seen anything like this, or thinks there is a connection to these two phenomena? Please study the photo provided and see what you think."],"Object Features":"Other"}
