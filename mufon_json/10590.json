Silent,slow,straight-line motion in approx. NNW direction-away from me. It did not seem to be an aircraft,fixed-wing or rotor. While its` speed may approximate that of a satellite, it was still daylight,and, I think,too low to be one, so satellite unlikely;hot-air balloon also unlikely(no basket visible through binoculars; also greater speed than a balloon). My partner first saw it as she looked out through the house window,to view the aftermath of a lovely sunset. At first it did surely seem like an aircraft,a balloon or a star. No tiredness or alcohol involved;quite a clear sky and no other aircraft in the vicinity at the time. The object appeared to be all brightly coloured,somewhere between yellow and white. It had a fixed base with two upward pointing white wings (I have to state the similarity to an Angel`s wings!) It was moving at a constant speed,almost directly away from us,so that at first it was difficult to decipher any motion whatsoever. It then gradually merged into some cloud - and all this with no erratic movement. I do not think it to be in any way unusual or exciting.....but we simply were unable to identify it,so I thought it was worth reporting."],"Longitude":"-6.260874","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10590.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10590.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10590.html"],"Case Number":"10590","Tags":"City","Country":"Ireland","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"04/26/2008 08:55 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"04/26/2008 08:55 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"IE-04282008-0015","Region":"County Dublin"}
