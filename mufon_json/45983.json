{"Object Shape":"Fireball","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile standing in a shopping center parking lot, myself and wife noticed a large fireball, initially impression was a hot air balloon size sphere combusting. But the fireball never burnt out, there was no smoke, contrail or sound. We then noticed a second fireball seemingly traveling adjacent to the first offset diagonally. Both objects traveled at approx 80 to 110 mph. Seemingly slower than typical helicopter in flight. The objects traveled in unison maintaining a constant distance from each other in a straight possibly slightly ascending flight but below a night overcast sky. The objects were observed below a dense cloud cover. Airplanes were observed in the sky at the same time as the objects but not in close proximity."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in West Hempstead","There were no other sightings in West Hempstead on or around March 1st 2013"],"Summary":"Two large balls of fire in the sky, est at 30ft in diameter, initially spotted overhead approx 150ft silently flew in unison straight and level to our SE until out of sight, have photo and video","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.709164,+-73.64831(45983)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45983) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/01/2013 10:12 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/01/2013 07:50 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, N/A","Country":"United States","City":"West Hempstead","Longitude":"-73.64831","Region":"New York","Log Number":"US-03012013-0008","Case Number":"45983","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45983.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45983.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.709164"}
