It never occurred to either of us to get a camera. It just sit against the mountain. No noise, no movement. It just sat there. It just sat there for who knows for how long. When I returned with a camera, the object was gone. 1. Taking the dog out for a toilet run. 2. The mirrored surface. 3. We thought it was a light from the university. 4. It was mirrored, so only by my movement could I get a shape. No movement. 5. I wish I had my camera so you could see want I saw."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Object was just sitting there, no movement against Moscow mountain, very bright.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.741688,+-116.996225(47335)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47335) map </A>","Object Features":"Dome","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"47335","Latitude":"46.741688","Tags":"City","Region":"Idaho","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Moscow","There were no other sightings in Moscow on or around April 10th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Moscow","Longitude":"-116.996225","Object Shape":"Blimp","Date Submitted":"05/10/2013 09:35 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47335.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47335.html"]}
