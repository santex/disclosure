I was looking over some trees in my neighbors yard toward the western sky. I saw a very bright white light that lasted about 3-5 seconds just above the trees. I would guess I was looking at about 45 degrees above the horizon. I can not say whether the light was on before it came into view over the trees. It only appeared to me that it was turned on and then turned off. At first I thought it was a helicopter that turned on a bright light. Then, the light went out and it traveled away with a light that looked like a small star. It traveled from west to east in a straight line until it went behind some more trees and I could not see it anymore. It appeared to be very high like a commercial passenger plane but its lights did not blink."],"City":"Conway","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.098467,+-92.484195(30455)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30455) map </A>","Longitude":"-92.484195","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30455.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30455.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Conway","There were no other sightings in Conway on or around July 29th 2011"],"Case Number":"30455"}
