Each occurrence has been at a different time yet it is always in the exact same location in the sky: SSE at about 25* off horizon. A very bright object (brighter than Venus in the morning) appears and glows for about 5 seconds, then slowly wanes until it vanishes. It does not move. I have seen it in the exact same place at 9:00 PM, midnight and now at 6:00 AM. Again, it is brighter than Venus is in the morning and somewhat larger. My son-in-law was with me out at our fire pit the first time I saw it and he saw it later that night as well. The first time I saw it I suspected it was a landing light on an aircraft but it never moved. I saw it again that evening about 30 minutes later in the exact same spot. 30 minutes after that, my son-in-law saw it in the same place I referenced. (The above date and time are for my most recent sighting.)"],"Date Submitted":"10/31/2012 10:55 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-89.410245","Region":"Wisconsin","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
