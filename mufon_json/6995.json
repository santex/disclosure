I told my youngest daughter to look straight up and ran to get my video camera. She couldn't see it. I told my other two children to go out and look and we went out and started getting video. It was headed from the East to West against the direction of the clouds. It was either in the clouds or just above them. I told my oldest daughter to get the tripod to try to steady the video. While the camera was off and I was putting it on the tripod the ball disappeared. I didn���t see it disappear but my son did. I have the firewire card now but still need to install it and as soon as I do that I can send video through email. The duration was about 2 minutes but I only have a little over a minute of video."],"Date of the Event":"05/08/2007 05:57 UTC","Log Number":"US-05082007-0009","Object Features":"Dome","Latitude":"42.754335"}
