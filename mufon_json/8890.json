Driving home from work (from Delaware) traveling on I-95 Northbound. About 6-7 miles from Philadelphia Airport I noticed an object cross over the road in front of me (at very fast speed-no noise). It moved incredibly fast--(fastest thing I have ever seen). The profile looked sort of Diamond--tear drop shape (small-craft). I was close enough to get the feeling that it had immense power resonating from it (and yes there were lights--but no noise). After crossing in front of me, it changed direction (again way to fast) and then sort of had a different shape--like a missle (cigar-shape...I guess) and was heading straight for Philadelphia--following 95. I lost sight of it in seconds. At this point I thought it was a missle heading for Philly. I then proceded to call my friend about this--that's it--the truth!!"],"Case Number":"8890","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around February 10th 2006"],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cigar, Diamond, Teardrop","City":"Philadelphia","Disposition":"Hoax","Latitude":"39.954885","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.954885,+-75.160959(8890)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8890) map </A>"}
