It changed colors from orange to blue to white to red, but was very high in the sky and hard to clearly see colors. Had an aura around it and pulsated. Object moved side to side and then would stop and repeated that action twice. All of a sudden, after about five minutes, the object disappeared. Right after it disappeared, 2 jet planes appeared high in the sky moving rapidly upward like a missile or the space shuttle--it was still clear it was jet airplanes--wing shapes were visible. Con trails and jets disappeared. Around that time, a dark, unmarked helicopter appeared overhead, fairly low in the sky. Four others witnessed the object, as this is a busy street."],"Latitude":"34.053934","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date of the Event":"05/19/2008 04:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10822.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10822.html"],"Weather Factors":"None"}
