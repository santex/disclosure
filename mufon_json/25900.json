I was going to work as a RN at the hospital. Across the road on the north lane side over a field at the Rosepine research station (an agricultural station) I saw a shiny red sphere hovering motionlessly in the air just above the tree tops and powerlines. I thought, what is this? I slowed my vehicle down. I turned in the median to get to the other side for a better look. I was curious I did not know what it could be. I stopped my vehicle and put it in park preparing to exit and examine this thing. I got the impression it saw me looking at it because as I was looking at it with my keys in my hand it suddenly changed from red to a silvery white color and zipped off very quickly and quietly. I have never seen a thing that could hover, change colors or move this fast. I thought it was fascinating and wanted to be able to study it further. Had it the intent or capability it could have got me. I was more curious than fearful at the time."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25900.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25900.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"shiny red like auto paint turns to silver/white sphere around 10-12' diameter","Region":"Louisiana","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.927915,+-93.275496(25900)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25900) map </A>","Case Number":"25900","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
