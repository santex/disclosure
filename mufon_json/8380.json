My daughter describes that their movement appeared zig-zag. They looked exactly like the sighting by pilots in Mexico, with the only difference that the lights appeared to be an amber or gold color. We never told anyone because we figured they would think we were crazy. However, once I saw the pictures in the headlines on AOL, I knew I had to speak up because what we saw looked exactly like that sighting. The other difference besides the lights, was a sensation that the drive was lasting longer than usual. It is our typical route for grocery shopping, yet that night, the drive seemed to take longer for the same distance. It was a feeling. We are willing to discuss this with anyone who'd like to question us. Please feel free to contact us. I am attaching a picture that is similar to what we saw. Let me be clear though, this is not what we saw...but when I saw it in the AOL headlines and it looked exactly like what we saw, I knew I had to speak up."],"Log Number":"US-11162007-0006","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.402868","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/07/2005 09:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Looked like that seen by pilots in Mexico only looked amber when we saw it.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
