At the age of 9 I saw what it was for the 1st time and ever since I have had the fear of it ( will it come back will it hurt me?) At age 16 I saw what it came in ���the ship it used to get form place to place��� At age 17 I saw it floating in the woods just outside town,we were 3 kids playing in the woods and one of the guys said ���omg man look up at the sun ��� We saw a triangle shape hovering 50meters or so from us. The sun gave it a red glow and out came 2 of them. Also red as if the sun was recharging there suits I have more detail on that but typing is not my thing Anyway at age 23 it came back but this time setting its eyes on my girlfriend now wife. What happened next was the start of something weird and out of this world. last night it came back this time hovering outside the bedroom on the 1st floor it had a strong glow that lit up the room by this time i woke up and spoted a devise that looked like a hand on the wall just above the bed,i tryed to wake up my wife but she was fast a sleep. after 15 sec the hand just vanished and i was thinking im dreaming but then my wife opend her eyes and her eyes was as black as the night i was shaking her to wake up but with no luck. then i heard a soft whisper from the foot of the bed,i looked up and saw a short blue alien I knew it was one the moment i saw it,and at that point i knew what was happening.my wife woke up and looked at it aswell,we where just staring at it for 30 TO 40 seconds. then we bouth passed out and had the same dream of handing each other red glowing orbs at 3am we woke up again with a headache and neck pain we went up stairs and just sat at the kitchen table for 2 hours before geting a word out on what had happend."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Cape Town","There were no other sightings in Cape Town on or around February 20th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"02/20/2013 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-33.923798,+18.429295(45826)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45826) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"18.429295","Log Number":"ZA-02222013-0001","Latitude":"-33.923798","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45826.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45826.html"],"City":"Cape Town","Case Number":"45826","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"02/22/2013 01:49 UTC","Country":"South Africa","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Western Cape","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
