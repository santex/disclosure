I am contacting you again for a different reason. We attend a drum circle most Sunday nights in Treasure Island, Florida. My husband was \"tagged\" in some photos from the drum circle on Facebbook. In two of the photos, you can clearly see what appears to be an object in the sky-maybe 300 ft? If you zoom in, it is amazingly clear-particularly in the second photo. I am attaching both. These are also available on The Treasure Island drum circle Facebook page.- I did not take the photographs myself."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Treasure Island","Summary":"There are 2 photographs showing an object in the sky over Treasure Island, Florida.","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"27.771694","Case Number":"42105","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
