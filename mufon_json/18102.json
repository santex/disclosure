She called out to me and said \"there it is again!\" I went into the kitchen and looked out the window with my mom. I watched it's movements so close to make sure it wasn't a star or a satellite. The more I stared at it the more it would dance. It was really bright and when it came close I could see it's cheveron shape. It would come close then go away. My mom went to go tell my dad and I stood there in awe. The animals around the house were going crazy. My mom returned and we stared at it for about 30 minutes later. She told me to go to sleep so I layed down and she retired to her room. I stared out the window about 20 minutes later and it moved north about a mile from where it was. I watched it until I got to freaked out to watch it. So I turned away and went to sleep with the thought of signs in my head."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18102.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18102.html"]}
