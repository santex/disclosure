I kept my eyes trained on the area it went out. 2 minutes later some other lights appeared in a close proximity to each other but were stationary. Its a clear night sky but with the fog rolling in so I thought it may well stars appearing from the night sky. Only then it started flashing quick colored lights red green blueish but then it would always seem to go back to either white or red before flashing again. The flashing wasn't fast or even sequential in pattern. At this point it started to float or hover but moving from the southerly direction back to the north overtaking existing stars. It didn't move far or fast but slow and sortve haphazardly. Not sure but my gut feeling was that it was trying to catch my attention. I felt focused upon it and unwilling to look away even for a second. The fog started rolling in with patches of cover so I would loose it then see it again."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/08/2012 06:50 UTC","Longitude":"-122.647809"}
