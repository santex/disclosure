This star was not moving but was brighter than venus, it was about 30 degrees to the south of venus. it stayed where it was for about three minets and suddenly grew 6 triangles ( each the same diameter of the ball). After a few seconds the triangles collapsed on the ufo and it dissapeared. My reactions were not to be afraid and freak out, I just said \" thats number two in my book\" and spent a day as normal at school."],"City":"Air Force Academy","Object Shape":"Diamond, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/05/2011 02:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33151.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33151.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.96345,+-104.832459(33151)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33151) map </A>","Summary":"Wight ball w/ 6 pointed triangles on all sides","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
