It was very dark and had been raining so the clouds were low. There were two airplanes overhead, one of which began to circle the area as the objects were hovering around. The objects hovered around for about 3 minutes. They would remain stationary for short periods, then rotate and move. You could tell they were rotating as they moved because a short trail was left behind them. Note that the trail and glow was some sort of orange energy, very similar to a mercury lamp on the street. They would also turn on and off intermitently. We were able to study them as we drove down the street. There were a lot of cars so I wouldn't be surprised if there are a few more reports on this one. Note that I also posted on the ufocenter.org website. Lastly, as one of them moved down pretty low, it turned off and reappeared over the other one. Wild stuff."]}
