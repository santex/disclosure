{"Case Number":"8492","divs":["sighting detailsafter i had finished watching the iu\\gt basketball game and a few minutes of the wisconsin\\duke game, i decided to head down stairs to do something else. as i passed by the back patio window that faces north, i glanced outside. in the northeastern sky i noticed this really brightly dual flashing object (much like the strobe light on the top of a school bus). i watched it for several seconds to make out what it was and to determine it's flight path. i couldn't. it seemed to be hovering or moving directly away from me to give the appearance of hovering. i asked my father who was still watching the wisconsin\\duke game to take a look as well. he came over and thought it was strange not to see any indication of red flashing wing tip lights like on a plane. i stepped outside to get a better look and noticed another strange object in the sky further away that seemed to be descending rapidly from a much higher more due east position. i almost thought this second object to be a falling star at first glance, but it didn't have a tail and didn't disappeared after several seconds. after watching it for several seconds it almost gave me the impression of a satellite, it was that dim and far away. it's trajectory was straight down. it didn't seem to be in a free fall or burning up in the atmosphere as it descended, so my impression is that it was descending safely under it's own power. this object had the same white flashing pattern but also had a dimmer solid white light as well. it was the very dim solid light that reminded me of a satellite traveling across the night sky. after several minutes, dad wanted the patio door closed so the cats wouldn't escape so i decided to come inside and get my digital camera to see if i could get some video. when i went back outside, the objects had both disappeared. this was approximately one to two minutes or less that i was inside. it's a bit strange in another way because it was very clear outside and i can usually see up to 3 commercial jets at any one time using the same flight path (the same as each other, not either of the two objects) from o'hare heading east. there was nothing else except these two objects in the sky during this time. i went back out later and these commercial flights had again resumed at their normal (very high) altitude and flight paths. note: dad suggested it might have been a helicopter, so this is the most likely explanation, but i thought i would pass this along and let you investigate further. let me know your findings. i am very curious."],"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"White Pigeon","Summary":"Very Bright Dual Flashing White Lights","Region":"Indiana","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"11/27/2007 09:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-11282007-0001","trends":["There have been no other sightings in White Pigeon","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.798106,+-85.643323(8492)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8492) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8492.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8492.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/27/2007 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.798106","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-85.643323","Source":"MUFON"}
