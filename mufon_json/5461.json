(i should note we get very little air traffic over my house, except for small, low-flying private planes and the occasional life flight helicopter. we do live about 25 miles north of grissom reserve air base.) at first, i dismissed it as a plane. then i realized there were no flashing or colored lights as on a plane or helicopter. also, i saw nothing resembling a comet tail or contrail. it was impossible to judge mass or distance of the object. the path of motion seemed to be ballistic, and i saw no accel\\decel, stopping, or turning of the object. the was no perceptible helicopter or plane\\jet sound, though i do have a small dam on my property which provides background noise. i've seen shooting stars before, and this was not one of them. i doubted i'd be able to see a satellite or the iss under these conditions, with the naked eye. after a few minutes, i returned inside and resumed my morning routine, mentioning the sighting to my wife who, while not as intrigued by these things as i, has an open mind, and said something like, \"hmm, that's interesting.\" i am a healthy, middle-aged white male with no criminal history, or history of mental illness or illegal drug use. while credulous, i also like to think of myself as an intellectual with good critical thining skills. i am a cad engineer by trade. i hope this report is of some use to you. feel free to contact me with any further questions."],"Longitude":"-86.125275","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.053654","Date of the Event":"09/26/2006 06:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/26/2006 06:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in athens","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
