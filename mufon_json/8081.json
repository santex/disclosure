We saw a cigar craft hovering either over a tree or next to a tree about 40 maybe less feet off the ground, right next to the road and near a house. Rural road. Mom pulled over. She and myself got out of the car to look. The craft had no windows, seams, and it was dark gunmetal matte grey in appearance. It was the size of a yellow school bus. I tried to walk under the ufo, but my mom said, \"no\" and my Grandmother was shreiking. There was no sound comimng from craft. We watched it for approx 15 minutes, drove off when another car pulled up as we were driving off. We went grocery shopping and came back to look for the craft, but it was gone. I have reported this before, but no one takes it seriously. No one talked about this, mother believes that maybe we were somehow hynotized not to make any big deal out of it. I was not afraid, but Grandmother was crying and saying for us to get back in the car because if the craft took us she \"could not drive a shift stick\"....unbelievable, but true."],"Object Features":"None","Summary":"Cigar craft hovering near house, close to ground...October, 1973","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"-91.825573","Object Shape":"Cigar","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.2033,+-91.825573(8081)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8081) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.2033"}
