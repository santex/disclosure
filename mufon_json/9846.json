This seemed to be the same object that I had seen in Bethlehem, PA in 2000. I thought that it was odd that I saw the same object moving at the same speed again and I again wanted it to land so I could meet the occupants. I had no fear, just heightened curiosity."],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Emmaus","There were no other sightings in Emmaus on or around August 18th 2007"],"Longitude":"-75.49492","Date Submitted":"08/18/2007 10:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Latitude":"40.544432","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.544432,+-75.49492(9846)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9846) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/18/2007 10:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03052008-0015","Case Number":"9846","Summary":"Aerial triangular object with lights on edges moving slowly without noise.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
