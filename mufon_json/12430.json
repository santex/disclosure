{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"five white spheres in a row at high altitude","Case Number":"12430","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsAround 10 a.m. my wife and I were sitting out in the back yard having coffee. I had just finished relating a dream. Interestingly, involving ET craft and interaction with a being. I stood to go inside when I noticed a white object high in the sky. The sky was totally clear above and to the west with a few clouds far to the east I immediately sensed that something seemed strange. I ran and got our binoculars. We both saw a white spherical object moving north. We joked that it must be a weather balloon. As we were looking and discussing we noticed four more. All identical in a row moving north. These objects were very high in the sky. They blinked in and out of visibility. We watched until the neighboring buildings blocked our line of sight."],"Date Submitted":"09/11/2008 12:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/11/2008 12:00 UTC","City":"Chicago","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-87.624978","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12430.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12430.html"],"Region":"Illinois","Log Number":"US-09112008-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.881224","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.881224,+-87.624978(12430)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12430) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There was one other sighting in Chicago on or around September 11th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown"}
