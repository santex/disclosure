Neither myself or parents saw anything in the sky during the times of the photographs. it wasnt until I uploaded the pictures onto the computer and went through them that i noticed that there was something in them . In my opinion the objects in the photo do not appear to be any type of aircraft that I know of ( airplane, helicopter). I am not surprised to see anything like this on camera but I just want an explanation."],"Case Number":"50839","Longitude":"-111.497741","Latitude":"33.450893","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Apache Junction","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Apache Junction","There were no other sightings in Apache Junction on or around September 14th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/14/2013 01:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09152013-0010"}
