They went out to see whales and dolphins. My wife's digital phone cam was set to 'burst' mode to capture pictures of the whales as they breached, and the dolphins as they jumped out of the water. Only after she returned home to UT and we were reviewing the photos on her phone did I notice the disc-shaped object in one of the photos. Apparently nobody noticed it at the time because they were all focused on the water. I thought it was a joke and she had an app on her phone to insert UFO's in pictures....but it was no joke and my wife isn't even technologically savvy enough to fake the pic, nor would she have any desire to do so. The object did not show up in any of the other photos as far as I can tell. I'm sure it's not a seagull, airliner, frisbee, or lenticular cloud...what it IS I have no idea! Please tell me what you think!"],"Latitude":"33.471852","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.471852,+-117.693698(46591)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46591) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46591.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/46591_submitter_file1__saucer.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46591.html"]}
