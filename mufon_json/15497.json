as strange as it sounds, after the helicopters had passed and there was no sign of the object, i still had a job to finish, so i made the delivery and headed back to work for the next. it took me a while to absorb how anomalous this occurance had been. i thought about reporting the incident to scott air force base but soon thought the better of it."],"Case Number":"15497","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering,Other","Summary":"Black triangle followed by black helicopters.","Log Number":"US-02152009-0005","Latitude":"38.52522","Date Submitted":"11/30/2001 09:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.52522,+-89.976894(15497)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15497) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Belleville","There were no other sightings in Belleville on or around November 30th 2001"],"Date of the Event":"11/30/2001 09:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-89.976894"}
