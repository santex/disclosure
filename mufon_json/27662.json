I was awoken to my son crying. A blue ball of light was a foot away from my son's second story window. He was in the fetal position crying out my name. when i entered the room i felt frozen and the light was soft and calm. for a second i felt like a fish looking out from a aquarium being watched and observed. I reached over to pick him up and took him to my room to my wife. and went running out to get a look at it thinking there is no way it was still around, but looking to my neighbors yard the object was indeed there moving slowly drifting away. for minutes. (i found myself thinking I need to get this on film, but when looking at it. you think it is only for seconds then it's minutes. I found that I was mesmerized and intriguing of what is going on that time flow by.. all my life i have seen things that where unnatural in the sky. but nothing like this."],"Latitude":"41.765281","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Hartford","There were no other sightings in Hartford on or around July 13th 2010"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.675673"}
