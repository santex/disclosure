(i only work on copies of the originals, which remain intact.) it���s difficult to see all that���s going on in these photos ��� a lot more shows in the originals. i have cropped details from these shots, but can only upload 3 here. the story of how i even came to be taking pictures of fog, one unremarkable day during my weekday commute, is too long to tell here. suffice to say that, since 2001, i have been somehow ���compelled by impulse��� to point my camera at various empty vistas ��� at all hours of the day and night ��� only to find the most amazing photos when i downloaded them to my computer. that may sound bizarre ��� but i don���t really care what anyone else might think. i have hundreds ��� yes, hundreds ��� of digital photos of nearly every kind of craft imaginable (and some far beyond imagining.) i also have some astounding photos of various ���celestial phenomena��� that also defy explanation. they also showed up only after i downloaded the photos. it may not be obvious, but the objects in these photos were definitely not visible to my naked eye. i wasn���t trying to take pictures of anything! there was no sound ��� nor was i aware of anything unusual moving in the sky. how did i feel when i downloaded the photos 2 days later and found these? fascinated and, truly, not one bit surprised."],"Summary":"Triangle shapes in the fog","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17311_submitter_file1__Fog1Pano.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17311_submitter_file2__FogPano2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17311_submitter_file3__FogPano3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17311.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"San Francisco","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
