At first I thought they came from a nearby tower to warn aircraft, but then realized that they were both higher, brighter and moved across the sky in a rhythmic pattern in a 1-one-thousand, 2-one-thousand, 3-one-thousand time frame. The flashes tended to stay at the same asimuth, about 40-45 degrees up. Flash one was the brightest at 3 o'clock then slightly not as bright at 12 o'clock then less bright at about 9 O'clock. As I traveled these became more eratic and less rhythmic. About 3 miles outside of Palmer, I caught one flash that bounced right to my left as I looked out the window and my eyes caught an entire rainbow of color. This was the last flash. I saw no more that night. I got home shortly after 10 pm so this happened between 9:30 and 9:50 pm. I am a scientist, so therefore the flashes were a curiosity to me."],"Case Number":"9503","Summary":"Flashes in sky on way home along country road 878","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9503.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9503.html"],"City":"Waxahachie","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-96.905973","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.464005,+-96.905973(9503)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9503) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/06/2008 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"32.464005"}
