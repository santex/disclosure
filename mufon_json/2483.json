It wasalmost twilight. I looked out my bedroom window toward Catalina Island, whichwas about 25 miles west. Our apartment was about 5 miles from the Californiacoast. Over the ocean I saw a glowing orange disc, standing still in the sky. Itstood still for several moments, and then began to move in a downward arc, goingcounterclockwise, to about the 8 oclock position. It stopped, very briefly.After a second or so, it shot up out of site at very high speed. At first I hadthought it was some kind of rocket or missile, because I had seen launches overthe ocean before. My reaction was matter-of-fact both during and after theincident, but now, 25 years later, I remember it like it was yesterday."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Date of the Event":"11/30/1978 07:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None, Unknown","Case Number":"2483","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2483.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"11/30/1978 07:00 UTC","Longitude":"-118.292246","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","City":"Los Angeles","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Latitude":"33.736062"}
