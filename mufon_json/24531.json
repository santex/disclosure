I noticed way up in the sky (it was the size of a star you would see in the night sky) an object travel across the length of the sky from south to north. Continued watching sky and saw about 6 more of these star size objects go across the sky another from south to north one from SE to N. They covered the distance of the skyline in about 30sec. They were extremely high in the air no way to make out a shape could have been shooting stars but I dont know. I have seen shooting stars before and these didnt act the same way. No trail behind them and didnt appear to descend. I did take pictures of the sky for some time and did find a object pop up in 2 photos that doesnt show in any others. This object looks like a star???"]}
