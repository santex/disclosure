I called for my friend to come see the orange lights and she noticed that they were moving, slowly toward the north. We could see then that the orange lights were below the star. The lights were spaced evenly apart and moved slowly and in tandem. After a few moments of watching, the middle one \"faded\" out completely, and the others contiuned on their northerly pathway, and it was at this time we looked to the right (south) and saw two addtional orange lights. They all continued on their northerly path and each light faded out one by one in a random pattern. This was a busy night downtown and many people saw this phenomena. Our personal reactions were surprised, curious and wondering just \"what the heck\" just happened."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Eureka Springs","Longitude":"-93.734469","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01172012-0020","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Eureka Springs","There were no other sightings in Eureka Springs on or around December 10th 2011"],"Latitude":"36.406536","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arkansas","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"34921"}
