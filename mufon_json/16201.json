There was 5 objects in each V and one on each side. Me and a buddy had seen jus one fly across the sky eight years before. There was no noise. They looked like gray cotton balls or turned out light bulbs, they wernt that noticable like everyone said a ufo claims to be. As they came more into view i thought it was fog or a cloud but you could see each object by itself. As it got over a large pond a few yards away then they came into a giant tight circle where they seemed to vibrate or wobble, but you could still see each circle, they mite have been going up or down im not to sure but it was suprizing how cordinated they were and that they didnt hit each other. i wanted someone to see this so i ran inside to get someone but when i came back they were gone so i have no clue where they went or how they left from there. It scared the crap out of me and now i dont look at the stars like i used to."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Other","Region":"Ohio","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16201.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/24/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"15-17 circles come across sky and stop.","Latitude":"40.915336","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03232009-0026","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
