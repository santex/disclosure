{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":[],"divs":["Sighting DetailsAs I was walking up the rear entry staircase to my house, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I looked down quickly to assure my footing, and then looked up. I saw what appeared to be a very large object, defined in shape only by the dim orange marker lights at each corner. I was struck by an intense sense of curiosity about this. The object was moving at a steady rate, and blocked out starlight as it passed overhead. There was no sound associated with the object. The location of this siting is very close to the takeoff and landing flight pattern for Anchorage International Airport, but there were no other aircraft in the area at that moment. I closed my eyes for a split second and watched again. The object continued on its path, and I lost it as it moved beyond my line of site. The whole episode lasted approximately 4-5 seconds. I have not doubted that others have witnessed similar things, but now know first hand what such an experience is like. Quite indescribable, yet very real."],"Latitude":"63.596763","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Alaska","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8316.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8316.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/05/2007 08:30 UTC","Summary":"Triangular shaped UFO blocks starlight in Anchorage","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-11102007-0004","Date Submitted":"11/05/2007 08:30 UTC","Longitude":"-154.485692","Case Number":"8316","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=63.596763,+-154.485692(8316)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8316) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown"}
