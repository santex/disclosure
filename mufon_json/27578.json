{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approximately 1528 hours Friday, 28 January 2011 looking due south, I was watching an F-16 on approach to the JRB. I noticed a very unusual object due east and at a higher elevation of the airplane. The object appeared as two translucent balls attached with a short rod. By appearance, it was like two silver-colored soap bubbles. Each sphere had a light that appeared to change colors, finally appearing about the color and intensity of aircraft landing lights. The object appeared stationary at the time. At first glance, the object had a milky translucent, almost silver appearance. The lights seem to move from right to left, constantly changing colors. I observed several colors. Greens and reds made the most impression. The object then appeared a more solid silver color, like Mylar, and that is when the bright white lights appeared. If there was any noise associated with the object, it was masked by the jet noise. I didn���t notice any evident interaction between the object and the jet. The whole observation lasted approximately 5-6 seconds. I grabbed my camera and ran outside to take a picture. As the camera booted up and the F-16 passed overhead, I looked up to aim the camera. I could not see the object any more. I kept monitoring the sky in all directions to see if I could see anything. After about five minutes of not seeing the object again, I gave up and went back inside. From my observation point, I could deduce that the object was probably at an altitude of 1500-2000 ft. over the Benbrook Lake. The object end to end, appeared about as large as the fighter. Assuming it was about the same distance away as the jet was to me, I would guess each sphere must have been about 15 feet in diameter."],"Latitude":"32.677568","Date Submitted":"01/30/2011 07:51 UTC","Case Number":"27578","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/28/2011 03:28 UTC","Log Number":"US-01302011-0005","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27578.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27578.html"],"City":"Benbrook","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.677568,+-97.457596(27578)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27578) map </A>","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Spheres over Benbrook Lake","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Benbrook","There were no other sightings in Benbrook on or around January 28th 2011"],"Longitude":"-97.457596"}
