{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI think we just saw a UFO, about 11:17 pm ago on the way back from picking my daughter up at work, it flew past overhead, going faster than any plane or bird I've ever seen. It was travel from the west going to the east. It was a large blue-white light, round in shape with crisp edges. (look up at a lit street light and that will give you an idea of the size. Now all the dogs on that same path of travel are raising hell too. No noise was noticed but our windows were up. Coming up behind us, it appeared over our heads and disappeared into the horizon in about 3 seconds. It was clearly a good bit over the tops of the trees but not up where jets travel nor even the smaller planes. clear cool night with plenty of stars visible in the sky and this was HUGE compared to the largest star in the sky."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.052173","Region":"Georgia","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Sugar Hill","There were no other sightings in Sugar Hill on or around September 28th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32170.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32170.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/28/2011 11:58 UTC","City":"Sugar Hill","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.122985,+-84.052173(32170)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32170) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-09282011-0028","Date of the Event":"09/28/2011 11:17 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"32170","Summary":"Large bluish-white circle with clean crisp edges","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.122985","Country":"United States"}
