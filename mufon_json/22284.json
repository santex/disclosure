( also last year my friend noticed \"lights\" driving past the airport towards brampton & i've seen them again in the same flying pattern as usual & it is on his & another friend's insistence that i should start recording this 'phenomenon' in some form ). the 2nd \"favourite\" flyby route seems to be in a straight line from direct east towards exact south ! ( & always fly near or over the lake ) . as a footnote , i did forwarded this info along with attached jpeg photos to mr. jim moroney at the aufosg on sat. march 6th \\ 2010. p.s. actually i am surprised at managing to 'capture' the ufo on my camera as it was some distance from where i reside & my camera is a simple kodak 10.3 mp with a 3x zoom only . p.s.s. on your media attachments i was only able to file 3 of the 5 photos that i've taken ."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Date of the Event":"02/07/2010 04:46 UTC"}
