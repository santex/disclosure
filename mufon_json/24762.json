I got my camera and went to the drive way out front and i saw a star when no otjers were out. It was a bright light then a ball of many colors. I watched it for 2 hours. I thought it was a star or a heli just hanging out but As i zoomed in i saw so many colors and it stayed in one place for the whole time. I captured it on film to 300x zoom and strobe and classic film. Then i tryed to set it back an focus more. Then the lights had other lights swimming around it in the air. I tryed to keep my hands still but i was excited, i used my fiances car to limit the shaking. I would get right on it and leave it the the light would slightly drift up and right slowly. I was so tired watching i finally needed to sleep due to my job and getting up at 8 am. I never lost the object just a dead battery. I tryed to look for it today but the sun is to bright for anything with my cameras. I feel as though i have seen this same thing many times just never got to record and zoom."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24762.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24762.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Inverness","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-85.746059","Date of the Event":"07/26/2010 12:00 UTC","City":"Inverness","Latitude":"32.014876"}
