{"Longitude":"-104.519958","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting Detailsi was driving home from denver ( i am a truck driver) on I-76 eastbound,i was passing through keenesburg, it was already dark, when i noticed a triangle shaped object moving very very slow, no noise. The points of the triangle were gently rounded and there was 1 light at each point for a total of 3. It was not a plane, too slow moving, and i have never seen a helicopter that shaped. I only noticed it because of the light formation and it was not very high up in altitude. It was moving from the northeast to the southwest across I-76. I was a little scared and was trying to look up out of the window, when i realizied what it was and almost went of the road."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.108316","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Keenesburg","There were no other sightings in Keenesburg on or around October 31st 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/31/2010 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27613.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27613.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/02/2011 06:58 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Colorado","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.108316,+-104.519958(27613)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27613) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"27613","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"triangle shape moving very, very slowly over keenesburg, co","City":"Keenesburg","Log Number":"US-02022011-0009"}
