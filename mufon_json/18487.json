{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"18487","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy 21 year old daughter asked if she was seeing a plane. I got up and grabbed the camera as I went. I looked up and saw it as it went over our house! It was heading South, a round red light that flashed a small white light near the bottom. It was moving slower than a plane, even in the dark sky we could see it was round. It curved in the sky, and I ran out to our backyard but it was hugging the treeline and made a photo impossible. I saw it heading back toward the North before I could no longer see it. Took three photos but they show nothing viewable. I will save them and send them in if requested. Two people witnessed this event."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.223573","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Red, silent orb with single flashing light curved from North and went in an arc back to the North","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.316693,+-122.223573(18487)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18487) map </A>","Latitude":"47.316693","Log Number":"US-08052009-0003","City":"Auburn","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Auburn","There were no other sightings in Auburn on or around August 4th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"08/04/2009 10:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/04/2009 10:05 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18487.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18487.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Washington"}
