They were diamond-shaped and illuminating with brilliant light I've never seen before in my life.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"New York","Log Number":"US-03072009-0019","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/04/2009 07:15 UTC","Latitude":"40.717833","Country":"United States","divs":["sighting detailsi was sitting on the couch in my friend���s apartment in manhattan when i looked out the window and saw this spectacular bright light in the sky right over new jersey, but not too far off the hudson river. at first, we thought it might be a star or venus, but it couldn't have been because it was so close and clearly in our airspace. my friend had a camcorder on hand and proceeded to film the object. we stared out the window for about a half an hour to see if it would move. it looked as though it was staying in one place, but when i returned to the couch, i noticed that it had changed locations and had dropped about 500 feet and north of where i had seen it originally. this is when the filming starts again, and we catch it zipping around in the air. no, the camera was not on a solid surface or a tripod, but we were holding the camera still enough to catch its movements. we then decided to get a better look on the roof of his building. when we arrived on the roof, we noticed directly below the object, a stretch of brilliant light illuminating and hovering over what looked to be cliffside park, or fairview, nj. i've never seen any aircraft light up such a large chunk of land and for such a long period of time. furthermore, there were planes and helicopters flying under, across, and over the object for the entire duration of the sighting. there had to have been at least one pilot that reported this to the faa. after being on the roof for about ten minutes, we noticed an additional ufo that seemed much lower in the sky than the first. it appeared and in about 5 seconds had vanished completely. after witnessing the second object disappear, we became increasingly concerned. also, the freezing weather was making things worse so we left the roof. by the time we arrived back to the apartment, the bright object was gone, and the brilliant light over nj was no longer present. it's a little hard to describe how we were feeling after the sighting. we were a little freaked out and confused. but, of course we are trying to stay skeptical. aside from being a bit freaked out, it was truly fascinating to have witnessed and up to this point, unexplainable. lastly, i would like to apologize for any profanity on the video. i was just naturally freaking out. the entire sighting lasted for about 1 1\\2 hours. by approximately 9pm, the bright star-like object was gone... note: time displayed on camera is two hours behind. i would like a field reporter to contact me."]}
