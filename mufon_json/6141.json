{"Summary":"Mostly flickering up in the sky but not no constant.","divs":["sighting detailsfist i appologize for not having the cell phone that doesnt have a camera it was around 7:45 to 8:00 p.m. eastern time. i work in and around the mines here in the appellation mountians. the area this occured at was a place called big creek on top our impoundment pond.that is a small man made lake that catches slurry, and its usually on the main top of a mountain. i was working the refuse belt lines, getting ready to take break. i carry my cell phone with me at all times i called up my wife with the usual i miss you chit chat, when all of a sudden this bright flash flickered up in the sky .my first reaction was excitement, because right away i knew this was no ordinary aircraft. it was close no more than a mile away and it almost made me run like a scared baby. this first flash\\flicker lasted only about 5-7 seconds. my first thought is a meteor, or a firecracker, only this didnt move. then suddenly the second flash; this was not at all like the first, this was more like a spotlight on a lighthouse with a greenish hue color. this lasted for more than 6 minutes long enough to get a good picture; oh how i wish i had a camera.the most peculiar thing about it was it stayed in the same spot,and where it was dark it was diffucult to tell the distance. there was also a plane flying over ,(and i know the pilot had to see it also)in the sky almost where this light was. the next time it came on the light changed to almost a solid red ,it was more like the first flickering, not like the spotlight.judging from the distance i was looking it couldn't have been more than mile or two off and not more than twenty five hundred feet up. this color also lasted about 5 min. (i had a clock on my phone.) it still hadn't moved horizontally or vertically ,and also it didnt have any trails like meteors and fireworks normally do. after this last flash dance it went out and never came back on,like it was extinguished, nor did i see it on any more of my shifts later. i was not a beliver in ufo's or alien lifeforms,mostly i didnt believe without proof. again i am sorry for not getting any photos of this spectacle,(that i regret the most). thank you for taking the time to read my story and if there is anybody out there with similar encounters please email me at jared@kymail.com\\\\"],"Date Submitted":"12/27/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Kentucky","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Pikeville","There were no other sightings in Pikeville on or around December 27th 2006"],"Latitude":"37.475169","Date of the Event":"12/27/2006 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.475169,+-82.523648(6141)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6141) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.523648","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6141.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6141.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Unknown","Log Number":"US-01122007-0001","Case Number":"6141","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Pikeville"}
