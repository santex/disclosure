I made a left turn onto Mansfield Ave. Once I got to the first cross street I noticed the full moon and southeast of the moon I saw five bright circles close and somewhat sporadic still in the sky, I moved a little further and saw them in a straight line. I pulled over and snapped two pictures with my cell phone. I got a little scared because of the phone's flash. I pulled off then went home."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Philadelphia","Date Submitted":"08/20/2013 06:51 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"I saw 5 bright circles that were still and started moving into a differently","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.065267","Log Number":"US-08202013-0011","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.065267,+-75.171504(50027)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50027) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Features":"Dome","Case Number":"50027"}
