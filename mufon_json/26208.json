Towards the St. Louis Arch, I saw a V-Shaped craft moving at a speed that was too slow for an airplane to remain in the air. I saw seven lights in an amber color in a V-Shape on the bottom of the craft as it flew over the arch at about 2,000 feet. It made absolutely no sound. It was heading south along the MIssissippi River, then vanished into the night. I continued to watch to see if I could see airplanes, I could see the strobes from the airplanes from a distance. The craft had no strobe lights."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.629492,+-90.196844(26208)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26208) map </A>","Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/29/2010 03:15 UTC","City":"St Louis","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10292010-0028","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"38.629492","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Chevron, Other","Date Submitted":"10/29/2010 09:03 UTC"}
