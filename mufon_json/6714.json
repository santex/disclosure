Last night I was walking home after an english class and I was near a field beside my house, anyway I looked up in the sky and there were these.... two green and red lights in the sky, I thought they were stars at first but they started flickering really strangely and they were really really bright. They looked as if they were right over my apartment building. Umm there were some fireworks going on near me but the lights were pretty high in the sky and they were moving around a bit. So anyway the red one... it looked like it dumped some other red balls over the houses because these little red balls fell out of the bottom of it and sort of disappeared before they touched the street. The green everytime a firework would go off would.... like.. flash it looked like a cone of light with bubbles on the sides, I know that sounds really weird but its the only way I can describe it. The cone was yellowish green and the bubbles were greenish and it would do that a minute after the fireworks would go off. So I went down my street knocking on doors and trying to get people to come out and see them but I dont speak much spanish and I think most of them think Im nuts now. Anyway so I went up to my apartment on the top floor where we put our laundry and I watched the green one go off into the distance and after about 10 to 15 minutes some other green balls appeared in the sky and they all disappeared together. So I went back to my girlfriends house (shes mexican) and waited for her and some neighbours came by (one of my students) and I told him about it and a local boy was walking by and he said he saw the same thing but from farther away... Anyway I was really freaked out and I couldnt sleep most of the night..... Do you know someone here around mexico city that I can talk to? Im in Toluca, Metepec and.... I would really like someone to talk to about this sort of thing.
