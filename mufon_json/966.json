It looked like it was slowly rising up in the sky. Thefirst thing that got our attention,was thered lights that was pulsating acrossthe back end of this craft. We could see that there was blue, yellow, green andwhite lights that was pulsating on thebottom of it. Couldnt see direction oflights pulsating, due to trees in theway, so we ran back to my house, I got mybinoculars, ran back outside, and thecraft had slowly moved away, so we jumpedin my truck,and drove to S.W.29th andCzech Hall road.
