{"Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsLooking sse from our house about 6 miles south of sullivan and 6 miles east of Findlay. Just over the treetops. A glow appeared lasting approximately 5 seconds. The glow was bigger than a star or plane lights. It did not flash or grow or fade or move. When it disappeared, another one immediately appeared a distance away from it -- more southward. A delay of a few minutes, then another one appeared at a similar location, but not the exact location. While it was similar to the glow of a fireworks, it did not arc or move in any way. And it did not slowly appear or fade away.... rather it just appeared and disappeared. Both my husband and I saw these lights -- a total of about 7 or 8. In addition, we saw a falling star to our east during this period of 10 minutes, along with fireworks several miles to our west. We also saw what we assumed was a plane, except it's light did not pulsate and it appeared to bounce along -- not fly in a straight line like the other plane lights we observed at the same time. This light was to our north moving westward."],"Longitude":"-88.753682","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Findlay","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"7797","Date of the Event":"08/31/2007 08:50 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"flashes or glow of reddish orange lights","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"08/31/2007 08:50 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08312007-0006","City":"Findlay","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7797.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7797.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.522537,+-88.753682(7797)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7797) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Region":"Illinois","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"39.522537"}
