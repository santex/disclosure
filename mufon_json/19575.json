I was on my way home from a birthday party, and I looked up in the sky and I saw a shooting star. I looked at it longer. Something was wrong. It wasn't shooting. So I grabed ny camera and took a picture. I still have the picture. It looked like a triangular disc hovering for about 15 minutes in the air. It had three lites on the bottom that were always on. Now I know no man made aircraft can hover in one place for at least 15 minutes. If you want the picture, mail me saying you want to have it.
