[cms\\tg\\pid] * note: approximately on week after this event took place, 2 f-15's followed the same flight path as the ship we witnessed. this may have just been a coincidence.however we don't have f-15's flying overhead around mcclusky. approximately two years after the sighting i was walking down an alley in bismarck nd and an air exchange unit came on up on a roof of a building. i immediately recognized the sound as the same sound that i had heard during the sighting back in 2003. this would explain the sound that i could not match with the thrust necessary to keep that ship in the air. thank you, [cms\\tg\\pid]"],"Log Number":"US-11212009-0007","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Summary":"Reference CMS 2426","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Shape":"Diamond","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"North Dakota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20637.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20637_submitter_file1__UFOSketchFront.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20637.html"],"City":"McClusky","Date of the Event":"07/10/2003 11:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.488241,+-100.440374(20637)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20637) map </A>"}
