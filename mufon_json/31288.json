It was kind of light bulb shaped, but its profile changed as it sat there. It appeared to be possibly spinning? More flat on one side than another. Light bulb, saucer, but up and down perpendicular to the ground, not hovering like a usual saucer. It just sat there for about 15-20 minutes. I tried taking pictures but it was just too small to see. I looked away for a brief moment, and when I looked back up, it was gone. It was weird because there weren't very many clouds in the sky, it was definitely too dense to be a cloud itself. It was too far away to get a real good observation of it. What stood out the most about it is that it was absolutely not moving in any one direction. It was above the same building the entire time, it didn't get larger or smaller or anything, it just hung out there."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.706833,+-92.047598(31288)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31288) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Oval"}
