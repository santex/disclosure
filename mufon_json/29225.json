I went outside to smoke with my nursing assistant. I looked the south and there it was moving slowly across the sky in the south, moving from east to west. Looked to not be flying all that high. Instantly I was shocked at what I saw. I told my assistant look at that triangle, I think we just saw a UFO! Best I remember there was a light on each side of the back and a white light under the front. It was some distance away but the shape was very distinct. We work night shift so I can't remember the exact hour. WOW my first sighting and with a witness. I am located 6 miles north of Dallas tx.
