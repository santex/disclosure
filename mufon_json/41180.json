It came all the way in front of us, and kind of went farther over the lake until we couldn't see it anymore. May have gone behind clouds, or just disappeared. As it came close to us though we could see a bright reflection on the water. After we no longer saw it we went back to the house to tell mom and sister, who came outside 1-3 minutes after the first object and there was another following pretty close to the same path as the first, except this one was over land. The second one was lost when it went behind trees, then out of our field of view. 3 pictures were taken of the second one. Weirdest part is the 2 objects were clearly orange when we looked at them, but the pictures show them as white."]}
