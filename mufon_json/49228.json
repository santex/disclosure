As I watched it continued brightening and dimming in a regular pattern, but unlike an airplane strobe, there was no white light, only the same color of pure red. I mentioned what I was seeing to the person on the phone and called my spouse over to look and he saw it too. Together we watched it until it moved out of sight behind the fence and trees. It appeared to be moving in a straight-line path at about a walking pace in an Easterly direction and the entire sighting lasted no more than 2-3 minutes. At one point the red flashing orb appeared to have two smaller red lights of the same color appeared on either side of the main orb, giving it a lenticular outline. After a moment the smaller lights went out, or the object turned so the lights were not visible to me"],"City":"North Bay","Region":"Ontario","Case Number":"49228","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
