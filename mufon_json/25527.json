We didn't understand at first what we were looking at and we were not able to get pictures in time. We only saw it for a minute or two. It had 3 lights and we knew it was way too big to be a plane. It was kinda swaying side to side but staying in the same general area util it was gone. Just before it was gone, it acted as if it turned straight up and down, instead of horizontal..and each light dissapeared one at a time. We both wish we could see it again!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.595808,+-82.917711(25527)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25527) map </A>","Summary":"3 hovering lights in a triangle shape, then disappearing","Tags":"City","Case Number":"25527","Source":"MUFON","City":"Charter Township of Clinton","Region":"Michigan","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
