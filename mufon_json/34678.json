(i was 8 years old at the time) that ufo wasnt more than 60-80 feet from us, and was a 4-5 foot wide ball of spinning glowing energy that spun red\\orange\\purple colors very quickly. that ufo suddenly shot up into the sky, turned white, and split in two and quickly dissapeared into the night sky. after i saw blow ups of the dec 4th 2011 photos i took, i was blown away, but how similiar the ball of glowing colors was to the ball i saw so many years ago up in mccall.... from a distance, the lights look like a very bright glowing red ball shining with intensity... but up close, there is soft edges, different colors, spinning intensity in the one i saw up close. looking at the photos, blowing them up, using different controls on editing the photos, and even using a redeye removing software to look past some of the red glare, i am convinced this is some sort of plasma formation. there are some very interesting phenomenon\\or camera artifacts viewable in these photos, which were all taken by myself on dec. 24th 2011 at 9.45pm until around 10:20 pm. please ask for permission to publish these photos anywhere. there were some similiar reports the next night in boise idaho, and i noticed also reports in oregon, washington, and california that sounded similiar. i am not very knowledgeable about how plasma balls form. but i have been doing research for the last week ever since taking these photos. a physicist i lived with at one time, told me plasma balls can be controlled by military technology, and even project sounds. this light i saw in december, seemed either motionless\\hovering, or moved in a very regular, seemingly controlled fashion. my impression in the beginning, before seeing the photos, is that this was an oject that was lit up, and not a glowing plasma ball like i had seen as a child in mccall, and that it was some sort of glowing blimp, hoax, or a ufo aircraft. i had the impression that this was under control of some intelligence of some sort. but understand that plasma formations can be a natural occurence. seeing the photos i am convinced its a plasma energy ball, if the photos are viewed under the right conditions\\filtered correctly, you can see flame like whisps shooting out and around the ball of light, as if the plasma ball was actually bigger than it looked. also notice in some of the photos, under the ufo around 1\\2-3\\4 of the photo, there can be seen a strange glowing purple area, either a ball shape, or like two small balls on the sides of a larger ball. i am under the impression, that this is some sort of plasma formation, but very subtle, and that this purple light has something to do with the phenomenon that i witnessed. it occurred to me, that the energy \"feeding\" this plasma ball, might be a field extending far beyond what looks like to be a solid object from a distance. the strange purple light is present in more than 2 of these photos, but is not viewable on all of them. in comparing all the photos, i see what looks like a cloudy mass, with irregularities, but fairly circular, but in others, it looks like a squarish, irregular spinning object, with dimpled areas that sometimes line up quite straight and regularly spaced, almost a sort of stiple effect. and in one photo, the interior looks as if it has bilateral symmetry going on, much like what a walnut shell looks like some sources claim that stationary\\hovering ufo's are in a low energy use period, and glow red, but as they speed up, they turn blue\\white. that might fit somewhat with what i saw in mccall, as the ufo did turn white upon flying directly up into the sky... but the ufo viewed on december 24th, did not \"power\" up, or change color when it did its short maneuver. of course, it was not moving extremely fast comparable to the viewing of the red\\white light in 1978 absolutely one of the most exciting nights of my life, in that i was finally able to get photos of a ufo. everything fell together, right place, right time, camera in the house, and a ufo that sticks around for long enough."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.634684,+-116.224561(34678)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34678) map </A>","Region":"Idaho","Country":"United States","Summary":"a pulsating, bright, red light, that did not blink until the very end of viewing it. it moved a few times and was very bright.","Log Number":"US-01062012-0028","City":"Boise","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There were 2 other sightings in Boise on or around December 24th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Date of the Event":"12/24/2011 09:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/06/2012 10:07 UTC","Case Number":"34678"}
