We saw a bright \"star\" off in the distance, right at the merge of Scott Blvd. and Church Street. When continuing the object became brighter and brighter. We came just below the object at the intersection of Lawrenceville Hwy. and N. Druid Hills Rd. I looked out the passengers window and looked up at it. The object was a triangular object with a bright white light on the bottom and two dull flashing green lights on the sides. I was looking at it and then I lost sight of the object for approx. 2-3 seconds and then it was gone just as a airplane flew over head. There is a public airport somewhat near by but the main object I saw was not a plane or a helicopter because there was no sound at all."],"Latitude":"33.777418","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/03/2008 08:36 UTC","Log Number":"US-12032008-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14209.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14209_submitter_file1__Picture12.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14209.html"],"Case Number":"14209","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Georgia"}
