It took almost 5 minutes for it to approach. Once over my house the noise sounded very low altitude. I was to tired to look outside, but the noise sent chills up my spine. The noise steadily dissipated over the next five minutes to the north, to what sounded like a perfect linear pathway. If anyone else reports this same incident I would love to be put in contact with them so I know that I am not going crazy!"],"Log Number":"US-09202009-0052","Case Number":"19512","Date Submitted":"09/20/2009 08:55 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19512.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19512.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-75.159449","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"no visual....just auditory","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were 2 other sightings in Philadelphia on or around September 20th 2009"],"Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"39.958505","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"09/20/2009 01:30 UTC"}
