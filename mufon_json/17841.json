When i looked up there were 4 glowing amber colored ojects fly in the sky with some distance in between them.We all seen it and people were like its helicopters but they were way to high for that, i thought they were planes at first but they werent flashing and were very bright.My uncle was saying it could be missles but obvoulsy we would have heard bout that sometime after.They just flew North i belive following each other, They seem to be very high in the sky, and how i lost sight of them because of the trees and line of sight as they kept going, but one did look like it went more up than the others and just disappeared. If anyone else has seen hopefully some pictures will surface, my mother did take picturres but they did not come out very well and she erased them."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 12:00 UTC","City":"Highland","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"4 unknown objects fly through NW Indiana.","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17841.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17841.html"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.446954","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Highland","There were no other sightings in Highland on or around July 4th 2009"],"Case Number":"17841","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.561817,+-87.446954(17841)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17841) map </A>","Latitude":"41.561817","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
