There has been a lot of plane activity in the aria lately so I didn���t think anything of it. I drove down the road continuing to talk to my uncle and watching the strange light as we were talking I began to notice the light didn���t appear to be moving it seemed to be staying with me like the moon in the night sky when your driving at night. At this point I began to get this strange feeling and was telling my uncle about what was going on. I had been watching the light for approx 8 minutes. I was now in marshal county approx 2 miles from state rd 331 when things really got strange I was talking to my uncle and watching the light when suddenly my phone went dead, I looked down and my car stereo went on full volume to nothing but static, and all the gauges in my car were bouncing back and fourth erratically. Then my car totally shut down. I hit the breaks to stop the car, looked out the windshield to look for the light and it was gone. I jumped out of my car to look around the sky to see if I could see the light and there was nothing in the sky. My car at this point came back on as nothing had ever happened, all the lights and gauges were functioning normally, the radio was back on the station I was listening to at normal volume, my cell which I had thrown to the passenger seat was now back on and functioning normally. I immeadely called my uncle back, my hole body was shaking at this point, and told him what happened. From his end he said a very loud pulsing sound rite before the phone cut to a busy signal. The time between calls was approx two minutes. Needless to say I was really freaked out. Later that evening I called the Bremen police followed by the state police to see if anyone had reported any weird lights in the sky I told them what happened and they told me that no won had called but the had an officer in the aria and they would be checking it out."],"City":"Bremen","Object Features":"Unknown"}
