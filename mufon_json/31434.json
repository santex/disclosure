ON JUNE 21, 2011 WHEN SHE SAW THE FLIGHT CONTROLS ON THE WING OF THE PLANE SHE WAS START MOVING. SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE AN INTERESTING PICTURE SO SHE STARTED PHOTOGRAPHING THE WING WITH HER DIGITAL CAMERA. WHEN SHE LOOKED AT THE PICTURES LATER, SHE NOTICED AN UNEXPECTED VORTEX IN ONE OF THE PICTURES. I HAVE SEEN SIMILAR PICTURESD FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A VORTEX ON THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE WING OR NEAR THE TIP OF THE WING, BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ONE FORMING ON THE LEADING EDGE AND OREINTING ITSELF PERPENDICULAR TO THE WING. IT APPEARS TO BE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE WING AND THERE ARE NO APPARENT OBJECTS OR AIR CRAFT TO HAVE MADE IT."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Case Number":"31434","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.667627,+-81.508254(31434)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31434) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"27.667627","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":[""],"Log Number":"US-09022011-0035","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31434.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31434_submitter_file1__122.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31434_submitter_file2__123.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31434_submitter_file3__125.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31434.html"]}
