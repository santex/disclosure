It was a group of 10+ flying objects and they were orange. They were flying slowly and they just started do disappear one by one. We do not have an airport in our city, so these things were not helicopters or airplanes. One of our friends has some acquaintances in Belgrade and they said that they saw this too."],"Date Submitted":"11/25/2013 05:59 UTC"}
