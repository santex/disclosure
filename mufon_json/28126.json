{"City":"Ventura","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Other","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were coming out of lions camp in Rose Valley Ojai,stopped at the top of the road and pulled over, turned the car off, and proceeded to have a cigarette, as we were sitting over looking the valley we were looking straight at the mountain called Piedra Blanca(White Rock) we noticed to the right of us about 25 yards away, there appeared a whitish amberish globe floating about the size of a large exercise ball,it was fading in and out a few times, then dissapeared ,then across the valley over to piedra blanca it appeared again then dissapeared. a few seconds later we saw a craft or ufo the shape of a large saucer maybe 300 feet across with a glass top ,in the glass top was a red ,green, and amber light circling around and around ,this craft started to move in and out of the rocks with this huge plasma glowing light behind it ,I noticed there was no sound at all in the valley ,no sound was coming from the ufo, it was very quiet. As we watched for at least 15 minutes went by when the ufo shot out a gold dust beam of light to the bottom of the canyon then a light from were it had been directed slowly went up the face of the canyon circled around the back side of the rocks and connected back to the main large saucer , it continued to go in and out of the rocks for about another 45 minutes then completely disappeared .In our opinion we think it looked as if they were looking for something in the rocks , maybe gold or some other kind of material or minerals.We would like you to invistigate Pierda Blanca in Rose Valley Ojai,california . We also have talked to other people stating they also have seen many things going on in our mountains (Las Padres National Forest) and our skies(Ojai)California.
