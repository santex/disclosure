We were working out on the floor (the courtyard lights were off), and then someone shouted: Look at the sky! Look at the sky! So we saw that huge object on the sky, passing by, silently (no noise at all). It took about 5 minutes. Coming from the east toward west. We could figure out about 500 m from ground. It was beautiful and very impressive due to its size and all those spot lights on its bottom side. I was twenty years old and I felt something like a revelation about extraterrestrial civilization. Our karate trainer, a colleague from the same engineering school, dismissed us from the karate class that day and we remained in the local area talking about what had happened for about half an hour and then we went home. I was so excited when I arrived home (a student house) and I tried to share my experience with my room-mate and other colleagues. They started joking on me and I gave up telling my story. Two days latter, there was a great commotion in the city because it was reported the case of Maria Cintra on a public hospital (The Clemente Ferreira Hospital). Some weeks latter there was the case of Tor���bio Pereira. Those cases can be seen on the internet in many sites. A week latter Maria Cintra gave a press meeting and I attended to that meeting, when I saw her reporting about what had happened with her on August 25, 1968. She reported about the landing of a pear shape object and a woman that asked her for water (aruma). The reporter that organized that meeting was Saulo Gomes from Gazeta Popular a Brazilian newspaper at that time (I am not sure about his correct name and the newspaper). But this reporter was also involved with the Varginha case, and I saw him at the television, several times. Concerning the case of Maria Cintra I am witness of what she said at that press meeting, and I have read several articles in the internet about her (all of them just like she reported, with a few variations). For several months after that day, many important people in the city reported other UFO sightings. Until now I hadn���t enough courage to tell publicly about that personal UFO experience. I am now a retired University Professor from am important Brazilian university and I finally decided to share my UFO experience (you can find about me in the internet just typing my name on a searching site and see several science articles I have written for important science societies). From that day on I started reading about UFOs and I learned a lot about it. Mainly about their psychological influence over or mind. There are many sects that follow religion and psychological approaches. And I keep my Christian faith in spite of the disturbance on my beliefs that followed that experience."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Window(s)","Case Number":"14456","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Region":"SÃÂ£o Paulo","Log Number":"BR-12182008-0007"}
