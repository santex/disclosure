As I do most nights, I walked out of our garage and looked up at the sky. To the west, I saw an orange round object coming across the sky from the west heading toward the east. It flew in a straight line. I asked my husband \"What is that?\" After about 10 seconds, he replied \"I have no idea\". The object moved across the sky at about the same speed as a passenger jet that we see often. We moved onto our front lawn to watch it until after about a minute, it just seemed to disappear in the night sky. We thought at first it might be a jet on fire. When it kept traveling in a straight line, we knew it couldn't have been. Within a few minutes, in the western sky, we saw an object falling at a fast rate of speed that was white, moving from South to North and disappearing. This round object was leaving a contrail behind it. Needless to say, it was an interesting few minutes."],"City":"Batavia","Region":"Illinois","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.851658,+-88.303514(18398)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18398) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-07302009-0003","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18398.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18398.html"],"Case Number":"18398","Country":"United States"}
