(in my rural area it is very quiet at night, and aircraft, even jets way up in the sky are easily heard). i now began to look for the lights every evening, and i began to see that even on nights when there were mid-level clouds, the lights appeared - clear and bright, and evidently below the cloud deck. i also began to observe motion in the lights - not at any blinding speed - they seem to drift both laterally and up-and-down, sometimes crossing each other's paths. duration of these sightings has been from a few seconds to several minutes at a time. they continued to fade and wink out after a few minutes. in november of 2009, i began to see changes in the behavior of the lights - some of them would begin to fade and then change to a strobe mode. when in this strobe mode, they move more quickly, and their changes of direction are abrupt and at acute angles. i also began to see a lot more of the lights at one time in november. when the lights get close to one another (from my vantage, one to three inches apart as viewed between thumb and forefinger of my outstretched arm\\hand) they begin to strobe very rapidly. i have seen as many as four \"orbs\" and twelve \"strobes\" in the southeast sky over fort collins at one time. last night (1\\24\\10) for the first time i saw two \"strobes\" flying directly over my house from southeast to northwest. i have purchased a pair of long-range binoculars, and i could see very clearly that each \"strobe\" in fact had at least four distinct lights arranged in a trapezoidal pattern. i would be delighted to find out that these lights are something ordinary, or something military - there is an air force base at cheyenne, wy, about 35 miles northeast of my location. i'm beginning to feel freaked out by the every night nature of this\\these sighting(s), and that to my knowledge, nobody else has mentioned these events. i did, with some trepidation, tell a colleague about these lights. she and her family also live in a rural area northwest of fort collins, but at a lower elevation than i do. she heard me out, and then rather startled, said that her teen daughter has been seeing the same stuff as i have been seeing, and for about the same length of time. i don't know my colleague's daughter at all. i'm not sure whether to feel relieved that someone else is seeing these lights or not. at least if i'm \"seeing things\", there are two of us. i'd love to know if anybody else in the area (northern colorado, along the front range corridor - interstate 25 and environs) has seen, reported, or knows for certain what's going on here."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"white/gold/orange moving orbs transforming to moving, strobing lights","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01252010-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21638.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21638.html"],"Longitude":"-105.078783","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/24/2010 10:04 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.59406","Date Submitted":"01/25/2010 11:35 UTC","Country":"United States"}
