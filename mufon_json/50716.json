At approximately 8:15pm on 09-09-13 I saw what I can best describe as a luminous line in the night sky. It was as far as I can tell a perfectly straight line, which from my distance must have been extremely long (mile?). It appeared to be virtually motionless despite changing cloud currents near it. Around 8:45pm it began to fade and slowly became obscured by cloud cover. At the onset of the event I called my mom who also confirmed seeing it. I attempted to take a photo of it with my cellphone and digital camera."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Clifton","There were no other sightings in Clifton on or around September 9th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50716.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50716.html"]}
