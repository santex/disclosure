I noticed around 10pm two bright lights moving across the sky in tandem. At first I thought the light was a satellite before I observed the rear light. The object moved across the Big Dipper that gave us some perspective of the size. It appeared cigar shaped and moved at a slow rate across the sky. The lights were non pulsating. I grabbed my cell phone and attempted to record the event. But the recording was too dark. We lost sight of the object after passing over the house. My friend and I were in awe of the event that took place."],"Case Number":"49633","Date of the Event":"08/08/2013 12:00 UTC","Region":"Wisconsin","Latitude":"44.233228","Tags":"City","Summary":"Observed very large object heading east in Appleton Wisconsin.
