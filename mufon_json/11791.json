{"Date of the Event":"07/18/2008 08:10 UTC","Object Features":"None","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was doing yardwork and heard an airliner passing over head. I looked up and noticed an orange object just above the airliner. They were heading east, the airliner along a usual route. The object was orange, seemed to be glowing. It was flying about two thousand feet above the airliner and moving slower. The airliner soon faded from view and about 20 seconds later the object also faded from view. The object was flying at a consistant speed and never changed shape or color. The orange color was similar to that of an orange traffic cone. It was about the size and shape of an oval pill held out at arms length, or of a blimp. About half the length of the airliner fuselage. There was nothing coming off the object, it was very smooth. The sun had set, and the weather was clear. It was still too light for satellites to be seen. The object was moving too slow to be a meteor and lasted too long to be an iridium flare."],"City":"Hemet","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-116.961998","Case Number":"11791","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11791.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11791.html"],"Log Number":"US-07282008-0011","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.75072,+-116.961998(11791)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11791) map </A>","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"33.75072","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Orange object flying near airliner","Date Submitted":"07/18/2008 08:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Hemet","There were no other sightings in Hemet on or around July 18th 2008"]}
