{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was three A.M. and attached to my room is a balcony which faces due west. I walked out on my balcony to urinate and due west just above the treeline i saw a very bright orange light hovering. It hovered for approximately 5 minutes and then slowly went below the treeline in the distance where i could no longer see it. before disappearing it was dead still and very bright no flickering or pulsing or anything. I found this very interesting as I am a believer and wish the government would stop lying about many things to us."],"Log Number":"US-05022009-0005","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"02/08/2009 03:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:17","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Virginia Beach","There were no other sightings in Virginia Beach on or around February 8th 2009"],"City":"Virginia Beach","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"36.857596","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Region":"Virginia","Summary":"Bright orange light hovering then disappeared.","Longitude":"-75.968975","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.857596,+-75.968975(16763)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16763) map </A>","Tags":"City","Case Number":"16763","Date of the Event":"02/08/2009 03:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16763.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16763.html"]}
