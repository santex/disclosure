The light was as bright and the same size as Venus which was in the eastern sky low on the horizon. I then noticed that there were two jets following it at about 6000ft on a parallel course one behind the other and about 5 seconds behind the light. I watched all three for about 30 seconds before they went behind some trees and lost sight of them. The light made no sound but I could hear the jets. I first thought that the light was a jet from the San Francisco Airport with its landing lights on but when it moved past the point when the lights should not be seen it was still just as bright and brilliant."],"City":"Santa Clara","Latitude":"37.359918","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Bright white light moving from north to south","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"02/11/2011 04:59 UTC","Log Number":"US-02112011-0013","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"02/11/2011 06:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-121.952606","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27773.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27773.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.359918,+-121.952606(27773)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27773) map </A>"}
