it appeared to be \"standing\" in the sky for a full minute without any perceptible change in perspective from my stationary vantage point. throughout this entire time, the red\\orange\\yellow\\white lights \"followed\" eachother around the circumference of the craft, as if to illustrate and underscore not only its mass and form, but its mere presence as well. i had rolled down my drivers side window to get a less obstructed view of the seemingly ethereal craft, and there were pedestrians moving through the crosswalk, confused by my deference to their passing. i pointed at the sky and asked, \"am i crazy? do you guys see an airplane or a ufo up there?\" well, i live in a predominantly russian neighborhood, and while their eyes followed the direction which i pointed to in the sky, they said something to me in russian which i did not understand, and bustled their way down the sidewalk. i stared at the anomoly in the sky for another minute, attempting to make my brain accept that it was a plane or a helicopter, and couldn't do so. then, a car came up behind me and blew its horn in frustration for being held up, and i was forced to go along my way., where i lost sight of it in the obstruction of trees and buildings. this is not something i have ever believed in. i always thought those people who said \"i saw a ufo once\" were crazy. and now *i'm* one of the crazies too. this witness has changed the way i feel about everything - from society to politics to religion to concerns about my own human and basic biological self preservation. i don't know who we are, as a country or a world. i don't know who god is- i don't know a lot of things - and it simultaneously stimulates, rejuvenates and terrifies me. i'm scared. and i'm elated. i'm faithful and faithless all at the same time. this may be the most all-encompassing profound revalation any human can experience. if i get the enlightenment, i'll take the opinions that i might be crazy. i don't believe in god - i never have - but this may be the closest thing to divinity."],"Date of the Event":"09/24/2010 08:33 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25553.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25553.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.054924,+-118.238685(25553)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25553) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-09252010-0005","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:04:30","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were 3 other sightings in Los Angeles on or around September 24th 2010"]}
