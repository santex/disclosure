Many appearing out of nowhere in the sky and traveling for a bit, sometimes pulsating and then fading or just simply passing overhead. I filmed one. They were extremely high up and never really came too close (that I'm aware of). I'm using a Sony HD camera with Super Night Shot Plus in order to be able to get them on camera so high up."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/09/2009 09:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
