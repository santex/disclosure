{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 9:45pm July 4th 2010 me and my wife were watching some neighborhood firework displays. Around 10pm we were watching the larger fireworks, the ones that go up into the sky and explode. As we watched a few of these my wife pointed to the sky and said \"what is that light up there?\" when I looked I noticed a round ball of orange light with light trailing behind it. At first I thought it was a firework but then realized how far up in the sky it was. I watched this light for about 3 minutes until it dissapeared into the sky going east. As this light was moving from west to east it would turn and go higher then back down to its original altitude. This was one of the strangest things I have ever seen in my life and it actually gave me cold chills. There were other families watching the fireworks display and they noticed the light too but we could not determine exactly what it was. Seemed like as quick as it came it was gone."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07052010-0036","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Greensburg","There were no other sightings in Greensburg on or around July 4th 2010"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"24183","City":"Greensburg","Latitude":"39.340172","Region":"Indiana","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 10:11 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.340172,+-85.476471(24183)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24183) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24183.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24183.html"],"Summary":"Large orange ball of light traveling east from west in the sky over Indiana traveling rather quick.","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-85.476471"}
