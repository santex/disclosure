It caught my eye because of the speed it was traveling, I knew it was not an airplane and thought for a second that it was a satellite. After watching it though I realized it wasn't a satellite either because of the shape. My friend and I had gone out on the deck to have a cigarette, and by the time I told him to come over and look it was gone. I was pretty excited about what I saw as he can tell you. But didn't report it until now after seeing the Stephenville story. It was fairly distant to me in Fort Worth, but now after reading about the Stephenville story, I would think that would be about the right distance and direction as what I saw. I'm positive this was not an airplane or satellite, there is nothing I've seen that travels that fast."],"Log Number":"US-01162008-0009","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"8923","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8923.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8923.html"],"Summary":"Long narrow light","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cigar","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"32.728699","Date of the Event":"01/08/2008 07:00 UTC"}
