{"Date of the Event":"07/02/2010 07:34 UTC","Summary":"Large flotilla at sunset , zoomed-in photos included.","divs":["sighting detailson a way to a store i've remembered i've forgotten to take my camera so i hurried to get home with some shopping , put it down without taking anything out & i just took the camera in my hand & went to photograph the sky as i felt the light ships are in the sky. well i couldn't see them with the naked eyes so i've concentrated & aimed the at specific parts of the sky , way high ! once i've put them in iphoto & zoomed in bit by bit , there they were & so many :-) my first few photos were directly in the w direction of the international airport with the beautiful sunset backdrop . than towards sw , few in midway of es & last one nearly above my head at 90* horizon level & perhaps 5-10* towards w & that's where most ships were ! they must have been at extreme hight as even in the zoomed in photographs they're tiny round lights. in 1 of the photos facing the airport once zoomed in i could clearly see an outline of a black military jet (it's in the 1\\3 bottom part of the, yet some of the lights seemed to be at the bottom left side but most are in the top part in that particular photo , i chuckled at seeing that. the sequence of the photos taken & the areas it seems they were on a path from wn to w to ws to s (most likely into the us). too bad i cannot submit more than 3 photos with this report , lol ! however , all the photographs are for mufon's disposal if you wish , just let me know :-] to the #5 question , well i almost didn't take a photo of where most of them actually were but this nagging thought came repeating itself \"take the photo anyway\" at the same time i felt joy , so i'm glad i didn't disregard the intuition ."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There was one other sighting in Toronto on or around July 2nd 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Tags":"City","Region":"Ontario","Longitude":"-79.379384","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Date Submitted":"07/03/2010 12:32 UTC","Log Number":"CA-07032010-0002","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.658496","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24097.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24097_submitter_file1__100_1005_2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24097_submitter_file2__100_1005_3.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24097_submitter_file3__100_1009_2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24097.html"],"City":"Toronto","Case Number":"24097","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.658496,+-79.379384(24097)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24097) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
