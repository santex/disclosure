We both thought it was supernatural. So it pretty much dimmed down after a sudden green flash, there was no sound or anything, we went looking for it, checked few roades around the area between Columbia River and Vancouver Lake but didn't find anything. When we where heading home after the search on our way back we saw a strange man, in the middle of nowhere; when it was dark and raining, and he had a little cart that he was pulling and walking on the side of the road, so we though that was a little strange. Also when we where in the middle of our search aproximitley 5-10 minutes after sighting we heard a strange creature like sound in our car."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"None, Unknown","City":"Vancouver","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-122.659726","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Date Submitted":"12/04/2012 10:24 UTC","Date of the Event":"12/04/2012 05:30 UTC","Latitude":"45.646998","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash","Log Number":"US-12042012-0011","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44323.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44323.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.646998,+-122.659726(44323)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44323) map </A>","Summary":"Sudden green light flash and then \"heat down\" and dissapearence few miles away."}
