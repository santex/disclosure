I went outside of my house to grab my wallet from the work truck when I looked up and saw what I thought was a star I hadn't noticed before. It was a large ball mostly white with a slight tint of yellow to it. I was starring right at it for several seconds when all of a sudden it glowed a little bit brighter, then excellerated away at an incredible speed until I couldn't see it. There wasn't any movement before it took off, it just hovered there in the sky just above the trees across from my house. No noise what so ever,no blinking lights like commercial plans have to have, and no tail light a comet leaves behind. I have no idea what it was, and I have to admit it startled and scared me a little bit. I really wish I had a video camera or a digital camera to have caught it. But it didn't stick around long enough for that"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.050554,+-110.669977(21880)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21880) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Medicine Hat","There were no other sightings in Medicine Hat on or around February 10th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"50.050554","Log Number":"CA-02132010-0012","Region":"Alberta","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21880.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21880.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"White ball of light with a little bit of yellow tint to it.
