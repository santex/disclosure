{"Case Number":"28411","Longitude":"-96.819432","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile driving on Ohio drive in Frisco the sky was very clear. I saw what appeared to be a green fireball. It reminded me of 4th of July fireworks however it was just one fireball and very large. My 13 year old was in the car and I yelled \"look\" and we both were like wow. We determined it couldn't be a meteor as we saw a meteor shower two summers ago and it looked nothing like that. We also said why would someone just shoot one firework in the sky and it didn't drop pieces of fire. It just very slowly shot across the sky and went down and just dissappeared. There was also what appeared to be an airplane traveling in the same direction and I was wondering if they saw what we saw."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.156374,+-96.819432(28411)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28411) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Summary":"Bright Green Fireball with a little white glow","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03262011-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28411.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28411.html"],"Latitude":"33.156374","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","City":"Frisco","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Frisco","There were no other sightings in Frisco on or around March 23rd 2011"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/26/2011 02:03 UTC","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/23/2011 09:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"IFO"}
