I'm bordered on three sides by the everglades in Heron Bay TPC. I have footage which I called my wife to tape while I drove home more than a year ago. My College daughter went out mocking my phone call to my back balcony before she changed her mind. The craft flew over my car and I stopped and my other daughter who I was giving a ride home from work started crying and told me to keep driving. We witnessed it from miles away and then encountered it. Tongiht there are several weird objects in the sky, not the encounter I had months ago. They are sitting over Palm Beach Airport. My back balcony over looks five airport flight paths. Palm Beach, Boca Executive, Commercial Executive, FTL, and MIA, also Oppalocka and other small airports.
