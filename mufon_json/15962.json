At first I thought it was a plane but when it stopped in mid air I knew it wasn't as planes don't do that. It wasn't moving very fast but as soon as it stopped it kinda came closer to the ground, to where it was probably about 10,000 feet off the ground then it started back in the direction that it came from. I pulled the truck over and stopped. I got out of the truck and looked up and the object and it stopped again then it sort of zig zagged left then right then the object split into to lights. I followed them as far as I could with my eye but I lost them after a few minutes. I wasn't very afraid as I always knew that there was something out there other then us. Strangely enough throughout the entire event I felt oddly at ease. One of the most calm times I have ever had that I can remember."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Pearson","There were no other sightings in Pearson on or around March 9th 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15962.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15962.html"],"Case Number":"15962","Date of the Event":"03/09/2009 08:40 UTC","City":"Pearson","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Object Features":"Unknown"}
