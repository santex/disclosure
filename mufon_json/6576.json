Noticed unusual triangular cluster of lights much brighter than starlight above tree level in west-northwest direction. At first thought they were Jet plane bright landing lights, but eastern course unusual for CVG. As I continued to walk, they did not move and were still there when I finished 10 minute walk around block. I got my Toshiba 4.2MPixel camera, and held camera steady agains telephone pole, took 4 photos. I lightened up photo considerably to accentuated yellowish collection of lights. Camera set at infinity, don't know shutter speed. By time I took photo object had moved slightly NW, and slightly lower in sky. Definitely not a plane or stars.
