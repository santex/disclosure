(phoenix is about 80 miles south-east of where i live.) the light was not a point source, but was softly diffused as if the entire circular or spherical surface was glowing. the total brightness was somewhat brighter than the star sirius. i watched the light for about 4 minutes, until it was no longer visible. when i went inside and checked my cellphone the time displayed was 5:14. i estimate the object would have passed over az hwy #17 at roughly 5:22, north of anthem and south of black canyon city. perhaps you have a report from someone in that area which will confirm this sighting. i am most impressed by the fact that my conscious awareness was aroused at the precise time necessary for me to observe the light through the bedroom window, as the light moved past my residence. if i had been looking 15 seconds earlier or later i could not have seen the object, as it was moving rapidly and the window is small. what conscious energy awoke me at that moment? -- an intriguing question. as to the identity of the light-source i have no doubt that it was an et craft, making no sound -- i went outside and could easily have heard the engine noise of a small aircraft at that time, just before dawn and very quiet, even the wind was still."],"Log Number":"US-03172012-0007","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Case Number":"36535","Country":"United States"}
