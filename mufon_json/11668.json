I alerted my friend and we watched the object move clock-wise across the horizon. The object moved from a slow rate of speed to very fast as we lost sight of it. I have seen many shooting stars, satellites and comets, but my friend and I are quite certain it was neither of these. I have never before witnessed anything similar. The sighting left both of us speechless and a bit disturbed."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wonder Lake","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"06/08/2008 11:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11668.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11668.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.384167","Region":"Illinois","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","City":"Wonder Lake","Object Features":"Unknown"}
