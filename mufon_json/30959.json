It was so bright I couldn't take my eye off of it. It proceeded to get brighter so I pulled off to the side of the road to watch it. I then noticed it got really bright like a ball of fire then proceeded to ascend slowly. One it stop ascending the ball of fire turned into a diamond shaped craft and proceeded to fly forward. While flying forward it seemed to dip quickly as if it was dodging somethin an very slowly then continued in a straight path right over my head. It had green white and orange lights rotating throughout the diamond shape.
