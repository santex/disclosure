I was worried about a Union meeting I was to be the focal point of the next day. I woke at about 2:30 am. I have an alarm clock by my bed. I have no blinds or curtains on my bedroom window. I am on the 11th floor and have a great view of downtown Saint Paul. As I turned away from the alarm clock I noticed a bright light which struck me as unsual. It took a second to figure out what it was. There were no blinking lights like you notice with planes or helicopters. I sat up and opened the window. It was about 3o degrees or so last night. I was wide awake with cold air blowing in my face. What I saw was a round disc in the night sky. It came from the south moving north towards the state capitol. There were no blinking lights, but it was lit underneath with pastel pink and maby yellow. The dominate color was a light red or pink. It sailed over my building and I lost sight of it. All I want to know is did anyone else see this thing this morning around 2:00 - 3:00 this morning?"],"Object Features":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
