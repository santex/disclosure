{"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"39782","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Utah","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy spouse and I were relaxing on our back patio, when I noticed what appeared to be airplane lights south by southwest from where I live. Since the lights weren't blinking, and since it was moving about the same speed as a commercial jet at cruising speed, I asked my spouse what she thought the light was. We debated for a moment, wondering what it could be. Coming from the opposite direction was a commercial airliner, with flashing white and blue lights. The airliner and the object my spouse and I were watching were going in opposite directions, but a few miles apart as far as altitude goes. While my wife and I were discussing what the object(the light) might have been, and since it wasn't blinking, it was white, not blue and red or any other colors, we determined that it was not an airplane, or commercial jet, nor an airforce jet. As the two objects began to get nearer to each other, the non-blinking light vanished. The light vanished in or around the area between Salt Lake City and Dugway, Utah. The light simply vanished, poof!"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Clinton","There were no other sightings in Clinton on or around June 23rd 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39782.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39782.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 10:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.136815,+-112.028316(39782)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39782) map </A>","Latitude":"41.136815","Date Submitted":"06/24/2012 07:32 UTC","Longitude":"-112.028316","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","City":"Clinton","Log Number":"US-06242012-0029","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"The object appeared to be the light(s) of a commercial jet.
