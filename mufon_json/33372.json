I watched as it noiselessly moved across the sky on a direct line to the east. There were several jets flying at high altitudes in the sky with contrails, this had no contrail and the sunlight reflected off of it like glass. I estimate that it was flying at around 10,000 ft. or so and as it was gliding above me, I realized that it was not an aircraft that I had ever seen before. Read that someone saw a similar craft over Ballwin, MO today. Didn't have a camera or phone with me. Always considered the possiblity, but now know it is a reality."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.714984,+-97.131599(33372)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33372) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/15/2011 11:58 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Andover","There were no other sightings in Andover on or around November 15th 2011"],"Region":"Kansas","Latitude":"37.714984","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"I saw a white shining craft moving east over Wichita, KS at 10:45 am central time.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"11/15/2011 10:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33372.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33372.html"],"Log Number":"US-11152011-0019"}
