I then pointed it out to my husband who also witnessed the event. The object was dark orange in color and did not blink. The shape was either sphere or oval, I could not be certain. it seemed to be coming from the South and heading North along the Mississippi River. The event lasted about a minute and then went out of our sight. It seemed to cover a lot of airspace in a short amount of time. I would be very interested to see if anyone else in or around the Muscatine, Iowa area saw this object as well."],"Date Submitted":"07/07/2013 10:47 UTC","Latitude":"41.431943","Tags":"City","Summary":"Dark Orange, Round Object Moving Quickly & Silently Through The Sky"}
