{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsMother's day outing, Sunday May 12, 2013. Took many panoramic photographs during the day (70+). Stopped to take a few photographs of my wife and of the view overlooking Long Island Sound towards Ct. After I downloaded the photographs, I observed three objects in the clouds above the water. In another photograph, a very obvious object that is not in the clouds and appears to be flying above the water. It appears to be black in color, and radiating or giving off some type of heat or force around the vessel. If you examine the photos, you can see people walking and the object is in the first photo and not in the second taken but a few seconds apart."],"Date of the Event":"05/12/2013 01:07 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:14","Date Submitted":"05/18/2013 10:55 UTC","Longitude":"-74.004393","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05182013-0013","Summary":"Total of four UFOs in two photographs.
