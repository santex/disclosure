{"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/05/2006 10:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was approvimately 10:30 P.M. at night. I had gone outside to look at the stars. I was facing east. I saw a jet in the sky moving from west to east very high. Imediately after sighting the jet, I saw a bright, fast ,moving white sphere like object moving from the south to the north. It crossed behind the jet. As it crossed behind the jet, it(jet) changed course and started in the direction of the object. Appeared to be in pursuit of this object. Suddenly the object disappeared, and at that time, the jet changed course again and continued in its original path. The next night at work, I started to tell a friend of mine what I had seen, and before I could even get a whole sentence out, he said \"I saw it too\". We both couldn't wait to contact each other about this event and were so excited that we both witnessed the same thing. It was good to have some validation. Exciting doesn't even begin to describe my feelings. Awesome, maybe!!!"],"Log Number":"US-09282008-0004","Date Submitted":"08/05/2006 10:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.587537,+-86.675006(12818)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12818) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Delphi","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Delphi","There were no other sightings in Delphi on or around August 5th 2006"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"40.587537","Region":"Indiana","Tags":"City","Case Number":"12818","Summary":"witnessed a jet and an unexplained bright light/fast moving","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.675006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12818.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12818.html"]}
