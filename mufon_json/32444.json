It appeared to move from the 90% angle into a horizontal position as if it were about to land on the roof of Apple Market. At this time it appeared to be about 100 feet above the roof of Apple Market and about 100 feet in diameter. The object itself was not actually visible to me, only the lights. There appeared to be a ring of approximately twenty regularly spaced bluish lights with a second smaller ring of what seemed like four flashing or rotating yellow-greenish lights as if they were perched some ten feet higher than the larger ring of lights. I think there were also three or four other yellow-greenish lights spaced between the two rings of lights, but it may have been the same three or four yellow-greenish lights appearing at different perspectives as the object moved at various angles and changed direction. I almost discerned some black or dark structural aspects that gave the impression of a large disc weight as is used with barbells with a smaller disc weight centered on top of it. As the lights first came into my view moving down out of the sky directly toward me, I thought it must be fireworks, but it did not disintegrate and leave ash trails. Instead it got clearer. I was really shocked and paralyzed with awe as it came toward me and did not seem as if it would stop. Then I thought it must be some kind of an aircraft about to crash, or perhaps a meteor, and you can imagine the thoughts that raced through my mind. I was quite calm and thinking logically through all this. I thought to grab my phone to call and say a final goodbye to family, but did not feel I would have time to make such a call. That���s how fast it was moving and how close it came. I was not afraid, but nonetheless relieved when it leveled off and hovered over Apple Market instead of continuing on towards me. I reached for my camera, which I usually keep in my car, and turned it on, but the object suddenly turned due north of Apple Market and flew over the subdivision immediately north of 63rd Street. It appeared to fly just barely above the treetops and disappeared. In a second or two it reappeared partially obscured from view by the trees. The entire sighting lasted about four minutes, long enough for me to get a really good look at it. I just sat in the car in the parking lot for a few moments trying to figure out what had just happened. The lights were so beautiful, like a colorful constellation, a carnival ride, fireworks, or Christmas tree lights. Once they did not crash into me, I really hoped I could see them again. As I mentioned before, I did not feel frightened, only exhilarated. The object had not made any noise as far as I could tell. I have seen airplanes and stealth bombers and helicopters and it did not seem to be any of those, unless one were painted black or very dark and had a ring of lights attached to the bottom of it. I thought for a moment it might have been a police helicopter searching for a suspect in the dark, but it was way too big and did not have search lights, only the lights described earlier. Plus, those tend to be very noisy, and this object was not. I considered the possibility that it might have been some kind of projected holographic image or special effects for a sci-fi movie being filmed. If it had been a pre-Halloween prank, it was a good one! I looked around to see if anyone else had seen the event. There were only a few cars in the parking lot. I only saw two people and they were outside of Apple Market, one was just coming out of the store apparently oblivious to what had just occurred. The people inside the store I saw through the window seemed equally oblivious. There was a man walking from his car toward the entrance of Apple Market with his head bent downward and he had been parked so close to the building that he likely would not have seen the event. The blinds at the window of Fantastic Sam���s were drawn and I did not see anything unusual through the glass door. The other stores were all closed. Only the bar was open, and I was not about to go in there and announce what I had just 8seen. I sat in the parking lot until 8:08 p.m., and then I began to drive in north on Woodson in an attempt to get a glimpse of the object again. I drove throughout the subdivision north of Apple Market but did not view the object again. I called only a few close family and friends. I was really concerned that if I told anyone else they might think I had become mentally unstable or was hallucinating due to some physical illness or fatigue. I am convinced that what I saw was very real and not some hallucination or figment of my imagination. I had considered that it might be some kind of spiritual phenomena, and as appealing as that thought may be, I don���t think it was. I am highly doubtful that the object was made by aliens from outer space, but I would not rule out that possibility. My best guess is that what I saw was some secret military project of the U.S. or some other country, say, China. I heard on the radio today that numerous independent reports of sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Kansas City, Lee���s Summit, and Raytown areas had been made. That feels like a validation, although I don���t need one to satisfy myself."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.007947,+-94.444889(32444)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32444) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/04/2011 08:00 UTC"}
