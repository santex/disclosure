Looked skyward as it was a beautiful warm, cloudless and clear night. Noticed what I thought was Orion's Belt constellation in the sky, but the stars in the constellation were distinctly brighter and had an odd hue, as if discolored by smog on the horizon. I paused to look closer and noticed that the red-orange \"stars\" were moving westward. They were moving in a loose formation; the individual objects listed lazily in the same general direction. As I continued to watch, individual red-organge lights would slowly fade to complete darkness until there were 2 remaining. They remained visible 20 seconds longer than the rest of the lights. Thought I could see silhouettes of the objects after they had gone dark. An airplane was flying in their direction, but it did not seem to attempt to intercept or change course during the event."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Case Number":"45988","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.783541,+-119.408622(45988)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45988) map </A>","Region":"California","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45988.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45988.html"],"Log Number":"US-03022013-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/01/2013 11:17 UTC","Latitude":"36.783541","Longitude":"-119.408622","Summary":"group of red-orange lights listing westerly. individual lights would dim to darkness with no sort of order","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
