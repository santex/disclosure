Looks cool sometimes. So, I set the camera up to take an MP4 video for 30 minutes and walked away. When the camera finished I took out the SD card, put it into my laptop and opened Photoshop Elements 10 and sped the video up 4000%. I noticed this black object popping in and out. I figured it was lighting or something so I had the software correct lighting. Thin I got what looks like lightning coming from the same spot in the sky and (almost) going back up. I checked the full length video and the black thing is there popping in and out of view, but have not as yet tried the \"lighting effect\". I posted the vids on YouTube (Jarreds Dad) and then facebook. After a while I figured I'd send you guys links to see what your thoughts are. So here you go."],"Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/18/2013 05:53 UTC","Summary":"Took a cloud video and sped it up.
