My family was living on an acreage in northwest Iowa, six miles from the nearest town. At the time we were renovating the second level of our house, and my bedroom was the only room on that floor. The Encounter: One night, at approximately 2:00a.m. I woke up in a cold sweat, because the sound of someone in my room had woken me. Living in the middle of nowhere, my room was usually very dark, but when I liked into the darkness, it was obvious that there was a small red light, blinking at a steady rate, much like a low battery light on a smoke-detector or record light on a handy-cam. The light seemed to hover about four feet off the ground and two to three feet away from my bed. The next distinctive thing I noticed were two thin cylindrical poles, in an A-formation under the light. The cylindrical poles were composed of a highly reflective ���silvery��� metal, much like aluminum. Beyond this ���apparatus��� and light, I saw nothing. For a moment I was frozen in terror because I thought that someone had broken into our house and was videotaping me. As I lay there, I had this horrible feeling that this had happened before. In a panic, I kicked at the apparatus. My toe made contact with one of the poles. It was hard, cold, and metallic. Instantly, The light blinked out, there was a sound, like that of a power-drill, and the two poles snapped together (parallel with each other and perpendicular to the ground) and moved approximately two feet farther from me. It was then that I ran from the room and down the stairs (I used the west stairs, since the apparatus was between me and the rest of the second level) and into my parents��� room (which at the time of the renovation had an open view of the front yard). Once downstairs, I heard footsteps going from my room to the master bedroom. There was a loud series of crashes followed by silence. After about thirty seconds, there a bright light flashed across our front yard. The origin of the light seemed be on, or near, our roof. The light moves from above our house and crossed southwest with astonishing speed and vanished. All the while, the ���aircraft��� never made any noise loud enough to be heard from the downstairs. Convinced that spies had broken into our house to video tape me, I woke my dad, and recounted the story to him. He dismissed the encounter as a nightmare and went back to sleep. The next morning, however, we discovered the east door to my bedroom was open. Which was unusual because we kept it closed to keep my room warm, since the rest of that floor was drafty, due to the renovations . We also found the screen to the front window in the master bedroom had been removed, and a shelf of paint had been tipped over. I assumed this to be the source of the loud crashing, but more importantly, evidence that it was more than just a nightmare. For years, I kept the encounter to myself and close friends, for fear of ridicule. I honestly believed the encounter to have been someone videotaping. Until I watched a show about alien encounters on the Discovery Channel. Now, I don���t know what to think about it. But I am not ruling out extra terrestrial involvement as a possibility. Interesting Aftermath: Since the encounter, I have been prone to sleepwalking. Episodes have been as extreme as waking in a field or waking while driving. The most bizarre episode occurred when hypnotized at a school party, senior year. The hypnotist suggested that we were seeing aliens and UFO���s. He then suggested others would deny that the UFO���s were alien. When a friend suggested they were not alien, I became violent and had to be induced to the ���sleep��� state of hypnosis again."],"Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"12/25/2009 06:07 UTC","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date of the Event":"08/31/1999 02:00 UTC","Summary":"An unexplained combination of lights and sounds in the middle of the night.","Longitude":"-95.155552","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"21133","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","Tags":"City","Region":"Iowa","Log Number":"US-12252009-0019","Object Shape":"Other","City":"Fostoria","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21133.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21133.html"]}
