At approx. 10:26 PM while relaxing and stargazing, I noticed a bright white light in the southern sky traveling north. It was way, way up in the sky moving a rapid pace. It took about a minute to dissapear into the light poluted skys above Carson City, NV. A few moments later another one, and then one more. all traveling the same direction but in different parts of the sky. I'm certain it was no falling star. They had a definate course heading. I've always been lead to believe that you may catch a satelite in the sky but 3 all in a matter of a few minutes ?"],"Region":"Nevada","Date Submitted":"08/08/2008 10:26 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12006.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12006.html"],"Longitude":"-119.764523","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.956074,+-119.764523(12006)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12006) map </A>","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Minden","There were no other sightings in Minden on or around August 8th 2008"],"Summary":"UFO or Satellite ?","Case Number":"12006","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/08/2008 10:26 UTC","Log Number":"US-08102008-0001","City":"Minden"}
