{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Oregon","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting Details I witnessed a coupled of objects that all of a sudden appeared in my vision in a north to northwesterly direction. This occurence lasted about two to three minutes. These objects appeared to be linked by some sort of body between the lights that I witnessed. These same lights at one point did what I would call a wagging motion similar to what a military pilot would do as a salute to fallen hero, but this was not as pronounced as whatr what we normally see. I would really like to find out what I saw a few nights ago, but that might not be possible as our own government doesnt beleive its own people anymore.
