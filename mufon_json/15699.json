It was exactly 2:00 A.M. Tuesday Morning.As I walked pass a window with no blinds, I saw I bright light traveling up and fire underneath. To me it looked like a space shuttle launch but from a far away. I yelled at my wife where she ran to the window and we both continued looking at it for about 1-2 min. We lost sight of it as it dissappeared in the sky leaving a trail of smoke. We were looking South of Fresno. Their is Lemoore air base but that is more South-West of Fresno. Was there a missle launch anywhere South of Fresno or on the Coast like Vandeberg air base?"],"Log Number":"US-02242009-0013","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.749657,+-119.763236(15699)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15699) map </A>"}
