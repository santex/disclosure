I noticed that it disappeared and after a couple of minutes it reappeared. At first I thought it was a street light then I remembered there was no street light in that location. The orb was directly in between to street lights and higher in the sky than the street lights. I went and got my camera and started recording it. The object would disappear and reappear. This went on for about an hour. I also noticed smaller orange orbs going up to and some would go up to it and then away from it. I wondered what it was doing and if it might come closer to me. After about an hour the orb disappeared and did not reappear. I watched to sky for a while longer to see if it would reappear and it didn't. I watched to sky every time I went out that night to see if it would come back and it didn't."],"Object Shape":"Cigar","Latitude":"33.384738","Date of the Event":"10/12/2012 12:00 UTC"}
