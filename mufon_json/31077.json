I started recording their flight and did till the top bird I was zoomed on disappeared. the video reveals it descintigrated and jumped at light speed. It strongly suggests it took off at light speed by seeing the red spectrum addherent to space objects moving away from us at the speed of light or faster. This report is a more broken down analysis of the original recording video.
