Joking with my daughter that there appeared to be UFOs in the night, I thought they were tower beacons. As we drove on the orbs reduced to two and were farther away, still joking with my daughter about UFOs but I started wondering what they were. As we came down the mountain the orbs appeared to flicker off and then a few seconds later with come back on. At this point I asked my daughter to record them on the video camera and this is what we recorded. We were still driving at a high rate of speed which makes the video 'shaky'. When we reached Orlando I remembered a History UFO Show about the Phoenix lights and that is what this reminds me of. I also found out that Luke AFB is in the area and what I saw were 'targeting balloons' but a friend familiar with targeting balloons said they would last this long and wouldn't come back on!!"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Spheres (3) that faded out and then 'relit' -","Region":"Arizona","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5224.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5224.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-08102006-0004","Longitude":"-112.71683","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Gila Bend","There were no other sightings in Gila Bend on or around July 24th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States"}
