I was on the phone with my boyfriend ( lives on west coast up bc of time difference ) when I notice 6 bright orange circular objects in the sky with white lights around them . After staring at the objects for a few seconds I told him I had to use my phone to tape what I was seeing bc I had no idea what was in the air . I then started to video record the event with my iPhone out of my 12 th floor apt window . The aircrafts did not seem to make any noise infact it was extremely quiet out my window which is odd for my location . I stopped recording the objects bc I wanted to call my boyfriend back incase something bad was about to happen . The objects all stayed together heading in same direction made a slight directional change in Unison. After about a minute or a little longer the lights on the objects went out two at a time . I sat back down at my table in disbelief and a bit frightened . About 15 minutes later 3 more appeared heading in same direction but this time I could see a helicopter in distance hovering as if they were watching the objects . I also saw a plane in distance this time . The three bright lights all went out at same time."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","Log Number":"US-03252013-0011","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.939212","Case Number":"46406","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There was one other sighting in Philadelphia on or around March 24th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Six bright orange objects with white lights traveling in a pack.
