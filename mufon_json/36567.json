The reason i noticed it is because they were bright red. At first i thought they might be plains or satalits. The objects were star like, the moves fast in a south west direction like they were being chased. They were parallel and then move apart like they were trying to miss hiting something and then back to the parallel flight. When they got to the tree tops they vanished, like they were never even there. When i saw the objects i was paralized at first, and then i text one of my friends to see if he seen them as well.
