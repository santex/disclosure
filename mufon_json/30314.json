{"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"10/31/2001 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile taking my children trick-or-treating in Lapeer Michigan, essentially downtown Lapeer, we were going from house to house when overhead a large orb of light appeared. It was completely silent. It was hard to tell a size or distance of the object, but I would estimate at 20 feet in diameter and 100-200 feet in the air. The orb just hung in the air while we and about 30 other people looked at it. It began to move with out purpose going to the left and to the right, back and forth, all in very quick jerky movements. It then shot off to the horizon faster than a blink of the eye. We did not know what the object was, but it was 100% not any form of man made aircraft."],"Latitude":"43.057146","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:25","Longitude":"-83.312264","Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.057146,+-83.312264(30314)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30314) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30314.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30314.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"07/28/2011 10:28 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Lapeer","Country":"United States","Summary":"silent and very fast orb of light","Case Number":"30314","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Lapeer","There were no other sightings in Lapeer on or around October 31st 2001"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07232011-0008"}
