It was uneventful and I turned my head to look at the Navalstation in Concord, when I noticed the object. I had seen many before, butalways looked closer and saw they were planes or helocopters. I had been out ofthe loop of reading and watching Documentarys about UFOs so when I saw it I waskind of calm and noncelont about it. The object it self was like a fisbee witha slight indentation on the top, it was refective goldish-silver color and wasjust hovering, soon I realzed it was slowly decending and moving back and forth.I looked away many times and it always was there when I looked back, but when mydad started to talk to me I looked away, when I looked back it was gone I lookedaround the area and didnt see a trace of the object. I simply shruged it off,but didnt tell any one about it, I dont know if my father saw it."],"Longitude":"-122.031073","City":"Concord","Date of the Event":"02/26/2002 06:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.977978,+-122.031073(1959)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1959) map </A>","Case Number":"1959","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1959.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1959.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Saw Silver disk from car","Latitude":"37.977978","Weather Factors":"Windy","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"","Object Shape":"Disc","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"02/26/2002 06:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59"}
