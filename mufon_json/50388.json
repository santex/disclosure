We watched it fly across the horizon at time we started to lose the object because of a tree so I ran to the other side of the deck so that I could watch it start to climb very fast and start traveling northwest at a very sharp angle toward the stars, when the object started climbing it took only a couple of seconds till it vanished. I have been watching the sky for many years now because I know UFO's exist but have never seen anything to verify my beliefs, I truly believe me and my wife witnessed something I can't explain..
