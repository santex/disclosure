I then went back in to my apartment to get my 2 guests to confirm what I just saw. We all witnessed the disc shape craft rotating while hovering stationary. Green, blue, white, red, and yellow lights flashed and pulsated. The craft then descended and looked as it may have landed. All the street lights flickered on and off when the craft descended. For all I know it's still out there. We watched the craft for 20 min and I decided it was time to leave."],"City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-80.453723","Region":"West Virginia","Date Submitted":"04/20/2013 11:12 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/20/2013 09:00 UTC","Summary":"UFO was witnessed by 3 people hovering and then decending with pulsating and flashing many different color lights","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","trends":[],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
