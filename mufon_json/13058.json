It was heading north towards my complex. I did not think anything being I live close to the Huntsville Airport. The strange thing is when it got closer it made an arc towards the west and the flashing red light went to solid red. It then turned again and started heading south and the red light started flashing again. At it's closest point it looked like a triangle, one red light in front and 2 in the back. The lights never had a white or green color like the planes and jets do when flying over. I came in for about 3 mins and went back outside where I noticed the lights again and watched it fly the same route. I am not sure if it is a plane because I would say it's about 15 to 20 thousand feet up but I never heard anything unlike the jet that flew over just before where I heard the engines."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/14/2008 10:18 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-86.983342","Object Features":"Unknown"}
