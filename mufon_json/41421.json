Well we did and neither of us noticed anything at the time but a few hours later when we were at my brothers house I wanted to show my brother the moon pictures and that's when I noticed in one of my pictures this strange light off in the distance under the moon. In the picture you can clearly see airplane lights on the top left of the picture, its the green light way off under the orange moon and above a street light. I'm not sure what it is but I thought it was weird, I took this picture with my samsung galaxy indulge phone with the night scene setting."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
