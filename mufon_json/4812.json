{"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on my front porch looking directly to the west, about 10 decrease from the horizon I see an Bright Amberlight,(as bright as the brightest star in the sky) just appear in the sky. It was moving slowly to the north horizontal with the horizon at about the same speed most jetliners travel in the area. It then shot off at an superfast speed faster than a shooting star. It faded out in less than one second and could not be seen.I then said to my wife ( wow) did you see that. It was only visible for about 20 seconds. After it disappeared I ran into the house to get my night vision. I then scanned the sky trying to find it but could not."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"32.110974","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in De Leon","There were no other sightings in De Leon on or around May 19th 2006"],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Saturn-like, Star-like","Date of the Event":"05/19/2006 10:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-05202006-0001","Longitude":"-98.535882","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4812.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4812.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/19/2006 10:45 UTC","Summary":"Bright Amber light,suddenly just apeared, moved slowly for 20 seconds, shot of to the north.","Case Number":"4812","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.110974,+-98.535882(4812)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4812) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"De Leon","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20"}
