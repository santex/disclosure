{"divs":["sighting detailsi was standing in my back yard, facing west, looking at the stars. i saw several prop planes flying with their lights blinking and could hear their engines. i then noticed a very bright object coming from the west\\southwest. it made no noise and was going in a perfectly straight line to the east\\northeast. it looked like a star, but was even more brilliant the venus. it was white with spikes of light coming out of it like a car headlight coming at you in the rain? spikey, i guess. i first thought it was a plane. the light was as bright as a planes landing lights. but i noticed it didn't have blinking lights like a plane and was completely silent. i watched it until it faded from view to the east. it didn't quit shining, it seemed to fade with the distance and ground lights from the city. i went from puzzlement to being perplexed, then shock when i realized it wasn't a plane. it was too low and far to bright to be a satellite. it seemed just a little higher than the other planes in the area, maybe 500 or so feet."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.963577,+-93.112879(23034)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23034) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Region":"Minnesota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23034.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23034.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Summary":"brilliant star-like object travelling west to east, silent, no flashing lights","Log Number":"US-04292010-0017","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in St Paul","There were no other sightings in St Paul on or around April 29th 2010"],"City":"St Paul","Case Number":"23034","Latitude":"44.963577","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"04/29/2010 11:11 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-93.112879","Date of the Event":"04/29/2010 09:45 UTC","Object Features":"None"}
