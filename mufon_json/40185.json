There are Fireworks all over the skies. We are in the Pierpont area of Ventura. Did anyone else see an odd STATIONARY object in the sky S.- S.SW of the Pierpont, Marina Park area, over the ocean about 45 min.to an hour ago? It had no \"regular\" running lights. no white lights, primarily red & blue, similar to emergency lights. It was below the marine layer. Colors pulsated and switched colors and then became primarily red. The event lasted at least ten min, that I witnessed. There was no air traffic in the air at the moment I saw it, & the stars were not visible due to the overcast. PLEASE tell me somebody else saw this?"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"STATIONARY object in the sky S.- S.SW of the Pierpont, Marina Park area, over the ocean. no \"regular\" running lights. no white lights, primarily red & blue, similar to emergency lights","Object Shape":"Blimp, Fireball, Sphere","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 09:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
