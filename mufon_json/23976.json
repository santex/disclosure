{"Log Number":"US-06262010-0024","divs":["Sighting Details Four of us were standing on the deck at our house in west Houston and we saw the first star of the evening in the western sky. Then we saw another bright object appear, moving across the sky near the star. At first we thought it was a plane, but then we realized it was much brighter than a plane. It was at least twice as bright as the star it was near. It shone with a steady light and was circular to oval in shape. It continued moving upward as we watched, and then it just disappeared. It was far above the horizon and there was no place it could have gone. I was always a UFO skeptic and joked about my husband who is a believer. So this is the first UFO I've ever seen."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23976.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23976.html"],"Latitude":"29.768783","Case Number":"23976","Longitude":"-95.36629","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Houston","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval, Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around June 26th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/26/2010 10:55 UTC","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/26/2010 08:35 UTC","Summary":"We observed a large whiteish blue moving object near the first star in the western sky but twice as large.
