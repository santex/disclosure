{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was lying on my boat last night and noticed two different types of ufos: A) several bouncing like stars that would fade and reappear. B) I also saw 20+ shooting star like object, but they never faded out and they were longer streaks of light and faster. Also one last thing to note, before I went down to the cabin I saw a UFO that looked like a plane, but it never left the sky. It arced over head then hovered just out of my line of sight. Seems like the water ways by Brick and Point Pleasant are good sighting grounds. I also saw some on the 4th."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Region":"New Jersey","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07132010-0003","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24475.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24475.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.059776,+-74.108376(24475)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24475) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24475","Longitude":"-74.108376","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"07/12/2010 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.059776","Source":"MUFON","City":"Brick","Summary":"A-falling star like, never dimmer B- moving eradict stars that dimmed and bounced and disappeared.","Date Submitted":"07/13/2010 03:05 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Flash, Star-like","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Brick","There were no other sightings in Brick on or around July 12th 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
