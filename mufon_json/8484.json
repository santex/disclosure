(i had 20\\15 vision at the time). i was so fascinated with the symbols that i cant remember much more about the ships except they were metallic silver like stainless steel. i guess they were about 20-30 feet long and a smaller dome sat on the top. after handing the binoculars back to my dad . we watched them for a while longer and i just remember my dad muttering ���what the heck are those?��� i just thought at the time maybe we have some sort of secret weapons or something like that. then all at once they began to glow brightly the entire craft glowed like molten metal. then all at once they sped off faster than any lightning strike i had ever seen . it was a blur going up and out to the north. and they vanished in less than a split second. i never told anyone about this until i became old enough to realize that if i didn���t tell anyone, this information would be lost forever. i have never seen anything like this since."],"Case Number":"8484","Summary":"We saw several disk or saucer sheped craft silver metalic in color in broad daylight could see words or symbols on sides They were motionless then glowed like fire and sped off in a blur at extreme speeds.","Date Submitted":"06/15/1972 04:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
