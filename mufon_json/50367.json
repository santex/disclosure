We were walking our dog when I suddenly spotted those two objects gliding over the sky. Those objects were bright orange constant lights... We concluded its not airplaine, helicopter, glider, ... anything we saw. Later that evening we heard six more people talking about the event. Unfortunately we didnt bring our cells to take photos or videos of it... Iam astronomer and I can surely tell it was not a comet, asteroid or meteor...."]}
