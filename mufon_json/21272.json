About ten minutes later we heard helicopters. More than one at first. Could here them for a few minutes before we decided to go outside. One flew over very low. We only saw the one, but we had definitely heard more than one. They were loud and low. Seemed to look dark blue, long and big, and had search lights on. Lights seemed to be too high for fireworks, although it is a possibility. Don't know why helicopters would have showed up like that for one quick incident of fireworks."],"Date Submitted":"12/31/2009 12:07 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12312009-0001","City":"Mt Pleasant","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Mt Pleasant","There were no other sightings in Mt Pleasant on or around December 30th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"12/30/2009 11:15 UTC","Case Number":"21272","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-79.53411","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21272.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21272.html"]}
