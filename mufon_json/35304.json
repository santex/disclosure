{"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsFriday afternoon while working outside I noticed many chem trails and started paying attention to the sky. Between noon and one I was watching a jet moving north to south and could tell it was much higher than the commercial aircraft that was also in the sky, so I figured it must have been putting off a chem trail above thirty thousand feet. As I was watching this I noticed what I thought looked like a balloon, yellowish gold in color and perfectly round,running parallel to the chem trail. It was moving south to north. I watched it for several minutes, sure that it was just an errant balloon until it passed behind the chem trails twice, meaning that it had to be way above the altitude of the the jets laying the trails. It also did not occur to me until later that it traveled in a straight line unlike a balloon being pushed about by the winds."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"32.740017","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/27/2012 12:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Arlington","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-01282012-0004","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35304.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35304.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Arlington","There was one other sighting in Arlington on or around January 27th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.740017,+-97.098236(35304)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35304) map </A>","Summary":"looking at all the chem trails yesterday afternoon and noticed this above them","Tags":"City","Case Number":"35304","Date Submitted":"01/28/2012 03:46 UTC","Longitude":"-97.098236"}
