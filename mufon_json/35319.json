I have a bedroom on the basement floor of my house and my bedroom window faces the road, but the road runs parallel to our house so I know what I saw wasn't car lights. I had just gotten into bed and was laying there for 5 minutes. Then, a blue light started shining in from outside my window, My blinds were down. I could hear a low key buzzing noise. It couldn't have been a car because car lights can't shine in my window. I then heard movement on the ground outside my window and saw a shadow crossing the blue light shining into my room. I was very frightened. It lasted 1 minute and then it suddenly left. I peaked out the window and saw very strange looking prints in the fresh snow we had just received earlier that night. They didn't appear human in the slightest, but I am certain they were no animal. This was my unexplained encounter."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"35319","Log Number":"US-01282012-0019","City":"Pennock","Sighting Duration":"00:01:15","Summary":"Blue light outside my window with blinds down.
