I often see satellites in the sky because I live in a rural area with no city lights. This looked almost like that, but two large, very prominant lights. They did not blink, just traveling along, then reducing to only one light of the same size. The single light traveled for a few more seconds and vanished.I waited to hear sounds from a jet, but heard nothing. It was only seconds after it vanished that I saw what I would usually see, a satellite cruising the sky. Usually I see only one satellite every few nights. This night I observed two satellites, cruising at different angles, just after seeing the odd lights. I know this couldnt have been a satellite, but it was also too high to be landing beacons on a plane. The odd lights were near where the satellites would have crossed paths."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.440865,+-120.564852(34798)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34798) map </A>","Case Number":"34798","Log Number":"US-01112012-0018","Date Submitted":"01/11/2012 10:05 UTC","Latitude":"38.440865","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/11/2012 06:11 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
