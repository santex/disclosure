Thought this was a firework then it hovered and then dissapeared.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking my dog listening to the fireworks in my area. I kept looking up to see the show but too many trees are in my neighborhood. However At one last glance, I noticed a reddish glow moving through the sky slowly. I thought maybe it was a plane but then the shape was more oval and seemed to have soft edges without any flashing lights. The glow was steady and did not dissappear. Then it stopped moving and hovered for about one minute in one spot then soon dissappeared. I always thought the universe was too large to think we were the only ones here. Now I know we are not alone. My thought was that either they thought we were at war or maybe they just wanted to watch the show from the best view ever.
