Next day it was all over the papers that there was a ufo sghtings over the aberdeen area of scotland. Soon after my sighting i was taken into an object from my bedroom. There were strange looking childreen there who i was allowed to play with. Before we were allowed to move and go at unknown speeds i was given a pill to counter the forces of outer gravity and light. We moved into what was given in thought to me another dimension. I feel stupid for saying this, but i have been abducted many times, but not in the last 9-10 yrs."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Summary":"v shaped object","Region":"Scotland"}
