I didn't see the object until I reviewed my pictures the following morning. Out of seven pictures that I took, the object is only in one of them. I never saw this object with my naked eyes, and I am stunned and confused by this picture. My wife was with me in the car at the time that I took the pictures with my cell phone. We were talking about how beautiful the moon looked over the mountain. I showed her the pictures on my cell phone the next morning and we both don't know what to think. I have all of the pictures on my phone and they are time stamped and dated."],"Longitude":"-117.816236","Date of the Event":"12/27/2012 04:54 UTC","City":"Tustin","Region":"California","Case Number":"44847","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Latitude":"33.750891","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Tustin","There were no other sightings in Tustin on or around December 27th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44847.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44847_submitter_file1__C36020121227165439.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44847_submitter_file2__C36020121227165439org.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44847.html"],"Object Features":"Dome"}
