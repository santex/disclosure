I used to work at LAX and have always had a fascination with with flying aircraft. I never thought that I would see something out of the ordinary until I saw bright objects flying around a central object that looked like a star. I had to confirm that I was seeing what this, I asked A person that was on his way into the post office to look up and confirm what I was seeing and he said that he did and asked how in the heck did you spot that?. I just told him to please tell me that you saw that and I'm not crazy. I Immediately drove home to tell my friends about the incident. I pointed to the star looking object. But there were no circulating orbs, they laughed at me and told me it was a star, but when that \"Star\" suddenly disappeared they stopped laughing. That is why I am writing you now."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/14/2010 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/14/2010 03:02 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Gardena","Case Number":"22291","Region":"California","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.893119","Summary":"One Bright central Round Stationary object/ with orbiting spheres","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
