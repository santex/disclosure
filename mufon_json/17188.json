It flew towards Reno and when it hit this tiny puff of a cloud it disappeared. It was just beautiful. The time is not exact but I remember the sun was not down enough that we could see stars. We did see a low flying helicopter going over Reno for a nice contrast. This was the largest orb we've seen."],"City":"Reno","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05272009-0008","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Nevada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.539253","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Reno","There were no other sightings in Reno on or around May 26th 2009"],"Case Number":"17188","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
