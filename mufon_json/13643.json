{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-96.827918","Object Shape":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsat home on the evening of 11\\16\\06, i let my dog out into the backyard and since the weather was nice, i went out with him. it was cool, dark and clear out. i saw a light in the sky that was unusually close, and thought it might be a helicopter flying nearby. it was silent, and i waited for the normal engine sound to follow, but it didn't. it flew by slowly at a surprisingly low altitude (like a police helicopter that is looking for someone), with red and green lights, not flashing. i could see no shape at all. while taking this in, i saw a second one, and then a third. i could see that the \"lights\" were going in a slow circling pattern over about a one-mile diameter area. they would disappear behind the trees and re-emerge. i watched each go by at least two times. while looking at one that had just circled by, it stopped, and started moving toward my home. up to now, i had been feeling curious, but at this point i was scared - it seemed as though it knew i was there. i thought \"wtf am i going to do when this thing comes over my home!\" at this point, it stopped again, and went back into its \"orbit.\" i quickly got my dog in the house and called the police department to ask what was flying over my neighborhood - the officer didn't know, and he radioed the addison airport (which is about a mile away) to ask. i could hear the officer relay my comments to the controller, who said that nothing had been or was currently on radar and that no planes were, or would be, in a circling flight pattern anywhere. (note: my neighborhood is not in any flight path in or out of the airport.) after the call, i went back outside and the lights were gone. a few minutes later, a couple of police officers stopped by to check this out further. in response to their questions, i confirmed to them i had not been drinking, was not on any medication, etc. i explained what i saw and said i simply wanted to know what the lights were. the officers were apologetic, respectful and i felt they believed me. they said they would keep an eye out for these lights during the remainder of that evening."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Addison","There were no other sightings in Addison on or around November 16th 2006"],"Log Number":"US-11102008-0018","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/16/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Three lights in the nightime sky","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Addison","Latitude":"32.97032","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.97032,+-96.827918(13643)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13643) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13643.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13643.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/16/2006 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"13643","Source":"MUFON"}
