Suddenly i noticed a triangle with curved lines orange-red light, over the buildings. I stoped my car and i record for about 30 sec with my cell phone. It looks like fire but with no flash It was moving with one side front and the top of the corner leading. No sound. Flew straight line over the buildings and finally dissapear near to the horizon in the clouds. My first thought was that looks like the fire of a little hot air balloon but the speed was much higher. I dont think it was plane due to luck of noise and the size and color it was not like thw lights of airplane i have see. Maybe a meteor but has no tail and flew straight line no Descent."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Larissa","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Larissa","Region":"Thessalia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31795.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31795.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/13/2011 06:59 UTC","Summary":"Triangle orange-red light flew straight line over buildings for 1min 30sec","Date of the Event":"09/12/2011 12:00 UTC","Country":"Greece","Object Features":"None"}
