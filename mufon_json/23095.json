{"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/28/2010 10:10 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking my dog around the block I live in and was just a few houses from my own home and was looking at the night sky because there was a full moon. It was a few minutes after 10pm. When it came into my line of vision I thought it was a v shaped cloud I was looking at but it was moving too fast and whatever it was made absolutely no sound of any kind and moved through the sky quickly, rather low. It was also as if the clouds were rolling off the edges of it. It was slightly a different color than the night sky but blended very, very well. It looked to be the size of the small home it was flying over. I did not see any lights on it either. I kept looking at it flying Northeast for maybe under a minute when my dog began licking my hand so I looked down at her but decided not to look back up and went into my home. As I read Edavid���s report Case 22911 I said ���EXACTLY!���. He did a great job of describing what I saw."],"Case Number":"23095","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"32.865936","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"V Shaped Camouflaged Cloud","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.865936,+-97.245897(23095)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23095) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23095.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23095.html"],"City":"Watauga","Log Number":"US-05022010-0018","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Watauga","There were no other sightings in Watauga on or around April 28th 2010"],"Date Submitted":"05/02/2010 05:21 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-97.245897","Disposition":"Unknown"}
