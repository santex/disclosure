I noticed what looked like a burning ember from a firework in the sky over the houses directly south of my house. However, instead of falling towards the earth, it was moving parallel to the ground and traveling slowly above our neighborhood from W to E. I watched it for 2-3 minutes - even called someone out of the house to watch it, too. It slowly ascended into the clouds as it continued traveling E. This surprised me as it I thought it was closer to the ground, but apparently it was closer to cloud level (maybe it was bigger than I thought...?). I eventually I lost it in the clouds to the east of my house. I could hear no sound as I observed it."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Menomonee Falls","There were no other sightings in Menomonee Falls on or around June 22nd 2013"],"Longitude":"-88.126465","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.179509","City":"Menomonee Falls","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/30/2013 07:57 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/22/2013 10:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"48535"}
