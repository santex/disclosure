I first thought it was a small aircraft as we do have an airstrip in town and often have small airplanes flying around. However, this was just like a strip of lights and then just vanished after a few seconds of flying in a straight line. At about arms length I would say it was about 2 inches. My little girl was outside with me and even asked me \"what happened?\". I waited about 5 minutes then went in to give my two girls a bath. After about 10 minutes my mother came downstairs and came in the bathroom..I immediately told her that I saw a UFO..she was shocked because her and her husband just came back from a walk and she had just seen what she described as something burning, falling from the sky."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32360.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32360.html"],"Longitude":"-85.572442","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"32360","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/04/2011 08:15 UTC","Summary":"I observed an object coming from behind the tree tops that had a row of lights on the bottom and was a skinny rectangle.
