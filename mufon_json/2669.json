Thelady seated in my car with me also saw the event and we commented on ittogether. It was hard to tell the exact distance and size of the objects. Theyappeared to have louvers across them on all three triangles. One flew separatelyand one appeared attatched to the other flying in a tip to blunt end formation.I could not assertain the size or distance due to the objects being outside myrealm of understanding. We continued to look, but never saw the objects again."],"Summary":"3 Triangles 2 attatched and 1 single all with louv","Date of the Event":"11/09/2003 02:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2669.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2669.html"],"Region":"North Carolina","Latitude":"35.236517","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Charlotte","There were no other sightings in Charlotte on or around November 9th 2003"],"Log Number":"","Country":"United States","Case Number":"2669","Longitude":"-80.836587"}
