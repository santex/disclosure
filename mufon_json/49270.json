I am Not looking for publicity. I don't care what anyone thinks about me. And I don't care if people think I'm crazy. I just want to know the truth. My Mom, step dad and me saw a lot of strange lights in the sky almost every night in the summer of 1998 or maybe 1999. Sorry but I really cant remember the year. A lot happened before and after that. But the night I saw the big red light come up and over the tree's is a night I will never forget (or never remember). Because that's all I remember. The big red light came up over the tree's and was moving toward me and I cant remember anything after that. Before that night my Mom and I both had waking dreams of someone standing over us and we couldn't move. I have a Lot more to talk about but don't want to on here. I really hope you don't think I'm crazy or making this up."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.354672","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49270.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49270.html"]}
