It was a clear night and I was looking up at the stars. My wife came out also and we were talking and as I was looking up at the stars I noticed what seemed like a small red star moving across the sky. I then saw several more red lights following the first one. I estimate there were about 10-15 red lights in what I guess you might call a convoy. The most amazing thing was that some of the red lights would shoot out sideways then return to the group. They were doing this on either side of the convoy. Shooting out then returning. My wife and I kept saying to each other \"What the hell is this, these are not airplanes\" The group of lights were heading north-east by my estimate. When the group began to dissapear in the distance another group of lights appeared. They also were travelling in the same direction as the first group. The entire incident lasted about two minutes."],"Date Submitted":"02/01/2004 01:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"2 separate convoys of UFOs.","Longitude":"-73.997533","Date of the Event":"02/01/2004 01:00 UTC","City":"New York","Source":"MUFON"}
