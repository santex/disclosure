It came back north, turned to the west and disappeared. No sound. The west to southwest turn was smooth and then the flight south appeared erratic. I had no idea of what it could be. I was in my back yard patio as I do when my Yorkie has to go outside. I always hoped to see something in the sky since I observed a slow west to east object blueish in color back in 1951."],"Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17398.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17398.html"]}
