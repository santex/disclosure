{"Object Features":"Other","Region":"Pennsylvania","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside in my backyard and was engaged cooking on my grill. Sitting down on my swing facing South I noticed a small silver dot flying at high altitude from the South at not a greater speed than an aircraft but on a course not noticed on normal flight path of general jet aircraft routinely flying at that altitude. As the unknown was heading toward my position it slowed and hovered. I let my wife know and got a camera. I was able to get photos of the object, some are impressive by any standard, I cropped the image and got a shape of what was witnessed but not close enough for true detail. Approximately 3 minutes after 33 photos were taken the object went West slowly at first then gained speed faster than any conventional aircraft I have ever witnessed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48729.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48729.html"],"Latitude":"40.310402","Case Number":"48729","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Diamond, Disc, Oval","Longitude":"-75.996032","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 06:41 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in West Lawn","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"07/06/2013 03:29 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.310402,+-75.996032(48729)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48729) map </A>","Summary":"Came from different direction than normal aircraft in distance.
