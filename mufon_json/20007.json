It looked like a star but it was bright red. It moved erratically with the wind at times. It was not a helicopter because it did not make any noise. Then a small white light came out in front of it then the object shot off to the east very quickly. I wonder if anyone else saw it? It looked like it was over NW Cicero, Illinois. I live in south Oak Park to the north and west of where I saw it. I did get it on film. I have to figure out how to up load it. I can then forward it to you."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/18/2009 08:14 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20007.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20007.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
