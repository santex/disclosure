(never seen with commercial flights.) their average speeds appeared to be \"too slow\" for any familiar craft at such low altitudes. this was apparent to the original witness, of military background, but obvious to the other witnesses as well. moments after the previous three were witnessed all at once, a dark or black craft of indiscernible shape was seen traveling from northeast to southwest, but was on a completely separate path than any of the other crafts. during the entire event, one witness was using an application (planefinder)on his iphone, which turned up no commercial flights at the time, with the exception of the obvious aforementioned flight. the entire event lasted approximately thirty minutes, with no more activity observed from the witnesses for the additional half hour they remained outside."],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"29540","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Virginia","City":"Hillsville"}
