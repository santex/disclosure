{"Case Number":"49600","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08082013-0006","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"08/08/2013 07:44 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were on our rooftop deck watching the sunset behind the Olympic Mountains when we noticed a black orb flying south of Puget Sound. It moved at a relatively slow speed and at various heights. We are very familiar with aircraft due to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport being nearby, Boeing being local, and the many seaplanes and other light aircraft that frequent our skies. We observed both commercial and light aircraft before, during, and after this event, all with appropriate aviation lights clearly visible, unlike the sphere. When we attempted to photograph the object, our cameras would not focus and thus a blur was all that resulted. Having done some searching on YouTube, I would identify it as being like the one(s) observed and filmed over Southern California and Ecuador around the same time period."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"Washington","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"47.61399","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-122.330601","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.61399,+-122.330601(49600)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49600) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49600.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49600.html"],"trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There were no other sightings in Seattle on or around July 1st 2013"],"City":"Seattle","Date of the Event":"07/01/2013 08:00 UTC","Summary":"Black orb over Seattle"}
