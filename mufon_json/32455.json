{"divs":["Sighting DetailsLast night in about 10:30 pm I witnessed something in the sky that put me and my wife in shock. Over the Atlantic shores of St. Augustine an unknown bright object in a boomerang shape with orange and red lights were drifting in the sky for 45 minutes and then stop and turn into a large white bright ball with a light tale. The object did not make any noise but the intensity of light changed every 10 seconds. So far I did not see any reports of such object from NASA, JPL or any other witness. The entire event was recorded and it will be available for the public tonight."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO OR ASTEROID?
