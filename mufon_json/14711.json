friend and i drove to a beer party in millcreek, pa. millcreek is a township just outside erie. technically, it is erie, but it's out in the sticks a bit more. erie as in erie, pa- situated on one of the ���great lakes���. when we got to the party, all the beer was gone- this was strange since it was not quite 9pm on a friday night. this wasn���t the only thing ���strange��� that would happen that night. in any event, we left party w\\a couple of friends and went to bar where \"minors\" could buy beer- we were all 18 and 19 respectively. after buying a six-pack of beer, we drove to an area close to the kahkwa club (i knew this area because my family belonged to the club) where semi-new development, houses, were being phased in. we parked alongside a road that lead into the partially-completed development. it was dark out that night but not that dark, so we could see our surroundings clearly. as i popped the top off my beer (pull-tabs back then), i happened to look straight ahead to my left- something caught my eye. what i very clearly saw, 300-400ft away, i couldn't believe: it was a whitish disc (saucer-shaped) hovering above a house. by \"hovering above a house\", i mean like almost sitting on it- just right above. i would estimate 50-75ft above roof of house. the disc was smooth and was roughly the size of the house (if not a bit bigger���maybe 1.5 times as large), which was a decent-sized, upper-scale, two-story house. i remember thinking: \"these people in the house should still be awake at this hour.\" i thought also that maybe the saucer was \"picking up\" people from the house. i couldn't believe it was that close to the house- just sitting\\hovering above it like that. surreal. in any event, the saucer was very clearly seen- it had a ring of lights, decent-sized and yellow or standard light color, which rotated or appeared to rotate clock-wise, based on which one lit up as the craft was stationary\\hovering. these lights became brighter as the ���spinning��� effect (of the lights only- the craft itself remained ���motionless���) accelerated. there was no noise associated w\\the disc. i watched this for about 30-40 seconds- the instant i thought to tell my buddy: \"hey, look at that!\", the saucer tilted as if on an invisible axis (it had been on a flat, stationary plane as it paralleled the roof of the house) and the lights started to get brighter and \"spin\" or rotate around at an increased speed. the lights were above the base of the ship, located midway on the disc\\saucer- there was a portion of the saucer that was above the lights. so, as soon as i started to tell my friend, who was too busy\\distracted opening his beer, the thing tilted on its side and took off. it moved very quickly, yet with no sound- it was if the saucer\\disc was sucked up via a vacuum, like it ���displaced��� gravity. i believe it did. by this, i mean the visual image\\representation (what i saw) of the saucer shrank very quickly as it moved upward. the rate it moved upward was nothing short of amazing, so the image quickly became smaller at a quick rate- this was interesting in that the image itself appeared to exhibit just a slight ���lag��� time as the craft moved away. most interesting- i have never seen anything move that quickly. within a few seconds after i thought to tell my friend, the thing was gone. while it moved upward, it did not move laterally- that is what i mean when i say that it moved upward as if sucked up in a vacuum- everything was constant in terms of its position except the increased height. again, i have never seen anything move like this- extremely precise. to reiterate: it moved as if gravity was simply ���displaced��� around it. this was a very close encounter, and the sense i got was that whoever\\whatever was piloting the craft did not want people to be aware of it- so it fled. i also know that we must have initiated heat-based signature-awareness obvious to whatever was controlling that craft. i also believe that it (they���whatever was controlling the saucer) was able to pick up on the fact that i saw it (my thought patterns) and that i was in process of conveying that information to my friend. when people think, energy changes and is more visible with the right type of vision. in any event, my thoughts corresponded to the movement or actions of the saucer. during the following week...after this ocurred...i was very tempted to drive back out there and knock on the door of that house to see what the people who lived there were like...do a quick cursory to see if i noticed anything strange. i decided against that because i thought that this was, in fact, not a good\\safe thing to do... but i kept my eyes open to see if any disappearances were reported in that area via the paper or the nightly news. i very-much thought that would be the case. i wonder how many people have seen a saucer sitting, hovering in the air, just above a house like that. what i have reported is the absolute truth- the saucer was unmistakably clear. if we had had cell phones w\\cameras back then, i could have snapped one heck of a shot. so, this is what i saw back in the summer of 1977, as an 18-year old, in erie, pa. a funny thing i just noticed as i write this description\\report- it���s as if the memory wants to take off- just like the saucer did- i noticed this as i started to write. very strange. another thing: when we returned to the party, we were greeted with: ���you guys were gone a long time.��� when i looked at my watch, i realized that it was a bit after 11pm. did't seem that long. to this day, i can still very tangibly feel the instant that the saucer\\disc took off- that part is very resident. this probably has nothing to do w\\anything- but it���s interesting- my father was part of the apollo project in the late ���60s, so i have seen first-hand up-close pictures of some aspects of that project- what i saw that night in erie was much more advanced- the technology was not even close."]}
