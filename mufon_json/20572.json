I reached up to adjust the rear heat in my truck using the overhead console. As I looked up, an intense bright green fireball appeared in the Eastern sky over Clarence, NY (right passenger side of my car). The fireball immediately shot left and then switched directions toward the right while moving downward at the same time (slightly diagonal direction until reaching a perfectly vertical motion) . As the object moved downward toward the ground it accelerate at a speed that I have never seen before. It continued to accelerate until disappearing as it neared the ground. I would estimate the beginning altitude at about 2000 feet. It appeared so quickly and it was so intense that it frightened me."],"City":"Buffalo","Longitude":"-78.872849","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball","Latitude":"42.892917","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"20572","Country":"United States","Summary":"Green fireball.","Date of the Event":"11/16/2009 09:15 UTC","Region":"New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20572.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20572.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.892917,+-78.872849(20572)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20572) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11172009-0020","trends":["There have been 56 other sightings in Buffalo","There were no other sightings in Buffalo on or around November 16th 2009"]}
