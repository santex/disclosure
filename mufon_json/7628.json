I was sitting with my dad, and I looked to the sky. I noticed an object zig zaging across the sky and blinking rapidly. It was disc shaped with 2 stubby wing looking things coming out of the front end. My heart felt like it stopped, and I felt very exited. my dad got up out of the chair saying \"oh my god, what is that?\". I said \"it looks like some kind of alien craft\" I grabed a spiral note book and drew a picture of what it looked like as it flew over. It stopped suddenly, and turned in place . It flew back towards us at about 1000 mph and about 800 ft. It made no sound at all. We finnaly lost sight of it behind a tree, and it was gone."],"Latitude":"39.266742","Longitude":"-81.561514","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.266742,+-81.561514(7628)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7628) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"West Virginia","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON"}
