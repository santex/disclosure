The flame was not like a liftoff, but instead more like a hovering and slow even force for lateral movement. The object moved across the sky at a very slow pace for about 45 seconds before I noticed that it was climbing in altitude. After about 2 to 3 minutes the light was gone as it went straight up out of sight."],"Longitude":"-98.699021","Log Number":"US-12312012-0009","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"San Antonio","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around December 31st 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.430315,+-98.699021(44869)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44869) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/31/2012 08:25 UTC","Case Number":"44869","Latitude":"29.430315","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44869.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44869.html"]}
