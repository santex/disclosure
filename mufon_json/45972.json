I was sure that it wasn't the average aircraft as the lights were brighter than any commercial plane I've seen so, I brought it to my husband's attention and ran into the house to get my phone for recording purposes. After grabbing my phone, I headed to the front yard so I could have the longest segment of footage I could get. As it drew closer I noted how quiet it was and it's strange rhombus shape. I followed their flight paths until I could see them no more. The aircraft seemed to come from Camp Swift, which is on Texas Highway 95 between Bastrop and Elgin. When you watch the video, note how quiet the first object is. I keep my eyes to the sky when I look toward my back yard as I've seen strange things up there before."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Diamond, Other","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Bastrop","There were no other sightings in Bastrop on or around February 28th 2013"],"Summary":"It was 2 fly-by's one after another about 500 ft in parallel paths","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45972.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45972.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:50"}
