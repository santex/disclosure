I was outside looking at the star's. It was very clear with unlimited visibility. The stars showed steady and bright. I was using a pair of 15X80mm binoculars. I was checking out some doublets, or that is what they looked like. After a moment one of the stars started moving in a straight line towards the NW. The first thing that came to mind was satellite but, I then thought no way, plus it was moving in a retrograde direction. I wanted to try and photograph it and maybe at least get a streak across the star field but, I lost the object and never could find it again.I don't have a clue to what it could have been but, it was like nothing I have ever seen before. It looked to be at a really high altitude but, of course, there was no way for me to say for sure how high it was."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/19/2012 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-102.366633","Case Number":"44173","Date Submitted":"11/27/2012 03:05 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44173.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44173.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Odessa","There were no other sightings in Odessa on or around November 19th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-11272012-0004","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
