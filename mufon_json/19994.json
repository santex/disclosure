It was moving very slowly in one direction. The suddenly it stopped moving and then suddenly and quickly flew away. It was amazing! What was even more interesting is that it made no noise what so ever. I thought it could be a plane but then the planes do make noise and don't stop in the mid air. Another interesting feature was that the object had bright red light and was easily visible in the sky. It appeared to be a disc shape. I was shocked by the happening."],"Summary":"A red dot in the night sky","Country":"The Netherlands","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19994.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19994.html"],"Region":"Noord-Brabant","Longitude":"5.005909","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Woudrichem","There were no other sightings in Woudrichem on or around October 17th 2009"],"Log Number":"NL-10182009-0007"}
