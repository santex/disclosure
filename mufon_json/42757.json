I looked up and I saw a large stationary, shining object in the sky. The moon was up and it appeared that the object was half of its size. I watched it for about 10 minutes and the object never moved. Someone in the crowd said that they thought it was a weather balloon but were not sure. I took a couple of pictures on my cell phone but the pictures weren't very good. I went into the store and when I came back out it was gone."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.52838","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":[],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09232012-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.52838,+-105.86831(42757)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42757) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/23/2012 02:38 UTC","Summary":"Bright shining stationary light in the sky - moon was in the sky and object was half the size","Region":"New Mexico","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"42757"}
