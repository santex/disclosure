As A watcher of the sky I took notice to the fact that it was moving slowly. I quickly observed that it did not have any strobe lights that would indicate it was an airplane. The object continued to move in a NNE direction and I had to cross to the west side of the street to continue observation it. Once it passed overhead it continued to be visible. Suddenly the light dimmed and dissapeared. This reminded me of pass overs of satellites, for which I checked and saw that a passover of SkyLab1 happened at 7;04 but did not coordinate to this objects brightness (as I was dealing with citylights) and direction.
