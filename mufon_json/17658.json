{"divs":["sighting detailsdriving back from work at night my friends noticed a white light moving across the sky at an accelerated pace. the object slowly started getting closer and we noticed that there were very dull strobes flickering underneath. it was quite soon that we realised that it was definitely not an airplane or helicopter as its flight pattern was quite un-natural. we speculated that it was maybe the us engineered predator spy plane. soon it flew slowly above our car while we were driving at approximately 80km\\h. i stared at what appeared to be a black triangle for about 20 seconds. it had 3 dull lights underneath, one for each corner. the lighting sequence went in a clockwise fashion at one second intervals. we were all filled with absolute terror when we saw that it was in fact a triangle with lights flashing in a sequence. the sequence was unlike anything a conventional man made aircraft would have. the impression that we got was that this was in fact some kind of spacecraft. it started to fly away from the car. at this point we noticed that it also featured a red (static) light. it then appeared to turn back around and followed our car as we manoeuvred through long sweeping freeway bends. it then flew away to the right of our car where we continued to watch it for several minutes. at this point we noticed that it also featured a green static light at the rear. my friends and i were in shock and kept saying 'it's a bloody spaceship!'. after a few minutes the object flew behind the clouds and disappeared. as i viewed the triangle for those 20 seconds i constantly tried to see if it was in fact a plane or helicopter. my 2 friends and i are 100% sure that this object was a black triangle. the light sequence on the bottom of the triangle gave us a very strange feeling that was we were seeing was not of human origin. one of my friends in the car claimed to have seen the exact same triangle about a year ago at the same time with someone else. object was silent"],"Country":"Australia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-37.807037,+144.97177(17658)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17658) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/25/2009 06:35 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"06/25/2009 06:35 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"17658","Region":"Victoria","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Melbourne","There were no other sightings in Melbourne on or around June 25th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Watched a black triangle fly above the car for up to 20 seconds.","Tags":"City","Latitude":"-37.807037","Log Number":"AU-06252009-0005","Longitude":"144.97177","Source":"MUFON","City":"Melbourne","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17658.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17658_submitter_file1__MelbourneTriangle.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17658.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
