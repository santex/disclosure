Where were you and what were you doing at the time? In the back yard having a smoke. 2. What made you first notice the object? Since I've had a prior sighting in 2006, my eyes are always looking up. 3. What did you think the object was when you first noticed it? It looked like a white grocery shopping bag floating by. 4. Describe the object and its actions and motions. It was moving in a straight line SE and against the wind with good speed. 5. Describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. I ran upstairs to my brother room to have him take a look at it. At the distance he saw it , it could have been anything. I just wonder how many other ojects stream over our head while we are not looking and I feel everyone will know the truth very soon. 6. How did you lose sight of the object? It crossed over my house from the backyard, ran to the upstairs front bathroom window where it faded away due east."],"Date Submitted":"03/07/2010 12:27 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"22184","Longitude":"-73.94143","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22184.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22184.html"]}
