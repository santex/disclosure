They appear very bright mooving slowly with a slight zig zag motion as they travel in a certain general direction. They appear either dimm and change to bright and back to dim or disapearing all together Or they appear bright and then dimm or disappear and reappear,various senarios. This happens throught the night in different parts of the sky. My first thought is satalites or some other man made objects but the zig zaging and dimming and brightening is confusing."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"STARLIKE OBJECTS","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-104.974763","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/25/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.747774,+-104.974763(29729)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29729) map </A>","City":"Denver","Case Number":"29729","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.747774","Sighting Duration":"00:03:10","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29729.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29729.html"],"trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There was one other sighting in Denver on or around June 25th 2011"]}
