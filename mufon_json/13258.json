(we were about 80 miles south of grissom a.f.b.). as soon as the four u.fo.���s were out of sight, i looked back and saw four more come from the same direction. they were not flying in formation, but all proceeded north\\northeast. a friend caught up with me in time to see the last u.f.o. which is he said hovered and lowered and then took off fast enough to disappear before his eyes. i didn���t see the last u.f.o. because a tree was blocking my view. i wonder if they were experimental military craft\\weaponry."],"City":"Indianapolis","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.777376,+-86.152444(13258)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13258) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10272008-0016","Longitude":"-86.152444","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Tags":"City","Case Number":"13258","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There was one other sighting in Indianapolis on or around October 25th 2008"],"Summary":"8 UFO's appear as orange fireballs flying north/northeast from 91st and College Avenue, Indianapolis","Region":"Indiana","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13258.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13258.html"],"Latitude":"39.777376","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/25/2008 09:31 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
