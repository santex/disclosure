I just showed her Venus in the SW sky. Then something caught the corner of my eye. It was high in the eastern sky. It was the same size as Venus and brighter. No sound came from it and it kept going in a Easterly direction for about 3 minutes. We looked through it with Hi Powered binocular's. It was not a plane. I ran out to the front yard to get a unobstructed view. Then it disappeared like someone turning off a light switch. Last point of view was still high in the Eastern sky."],"Summary":"Looked like a star moving","Date of the Event":"08/25/2013 08:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Fresno","There were no other sightings in Fresno on or around August 25th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"08/26/2013 12:09 UTC","Longitude":"-119.766697","City":"Fresno","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown"}
