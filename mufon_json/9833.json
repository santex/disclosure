A few minutes latter I walked outside. I glanced up and saw 2 round pulsing red lights...one fallowing the other. I was looking west and they were moving s-sw at a very fast speed. I did not hear any sound..as they grew smaller on the horizon I heard jet planes aproaching from the north going in the same direction. Thats it. I live in a very heavy air traffic area and have never seen lights like these...nor have I seen any aircraft move that fast. It is also very rare to hear jets flying so low."],"Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9833.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9833.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
