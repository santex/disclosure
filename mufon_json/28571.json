It seemed to be coming toward us in fairly fast rate. It stopped approximately 500yards from us and began to hover across the neighborhood. The color of the lights were red and blue. There was sound to it as it traveled. We heard and felt vibrations (humming sound) that were going high and low. This object was seen and felt previously approximately 1 year ago near the same neighborhood causing trees to vibrate. Im not sure what it was at first. I though it was a helicopter or plane since the airport is close to us but, this object was very different. After looking at it for about 15-30mins the object headed out of view."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.617127,+-121.328284(28571)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28571) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Carmichael","There were no other sightings in Carmichael on or around March 30th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"28571","Latitude":"38.617127","City":"Carmichael","Longitude":"-121.328284"}
