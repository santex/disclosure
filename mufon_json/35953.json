{"Longitude":"-75.229764","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.102203","Summary":"Orb Like Object rapidly accelerates & decellerates","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was heading into work when I noticed object traveling from east to west. It seemed round and kinda flickered almost like it was rotating with sunlight reflecting off of it as it moved west. I started recording it with my phone and tracked it as it past behind a brick building. When it reemerged it literally shot out the other side. Somehow it accelerated instantly and then just as suddenly slowed down.At the time I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. After reviewing the shaky footage it did indeed appear to do what I had witnessed. After stabilizing the footage the acceleration of the object is clearly seen and in my opinion is quite remarkable. Object continued traveling east then banked to a more south east direction. I stopped recording at that point so I could get into work on time."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Case Number":"35953","Date Submitted":"02/20/2012 05:59 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35953.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35953.html"],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Utica","There were no other sightings in Utica on or around December 10th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-02202012-0011","Date of the Event":"12/10/2011 09:26 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Region":"New York","City":"Utica","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.102203,+-75.229764(35953)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35953) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
