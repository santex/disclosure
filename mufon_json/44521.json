As we entered ramp to M-59 from 75, I observed three lights toward SW at some distance. Having studied aircraft and air flight of various WWII, other planes, these lights were stationary, did not move, bright and immediately caught my attention. I have a video on my phone, and a photo. We pulled over and I filmed. My son was freaked out and we had to get to practice. When I zoomed in, it was clear the lights contained additional colors. I had the distinct feeling this was not of our planet simply because planes at Metro were behind these lights. I am still uncertain of what I saw and am hoping to upload my video and photo soon."],"Log Number":"US-12132012-0016","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Pontiac","There was one other sighting in Pontiac on or around December 6th 2012"],"Object Features":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"44521","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.640202"}
