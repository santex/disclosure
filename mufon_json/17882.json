It was traveling east to west in a straight line and the height was between 150 to 300 feet . When it passed by or over the building I could hear a hum other than that there was no engine sounds or jet sounds . Five bright white lights across the back side of it and a red light . It was strobing with some of the white lites doing a double flash , like blip blib every 10 secounds or so . The size was about 30 to 50 feet across the back side if not longer . I had it in sight for about a minute and a half untill it faded out of sight in the distance . I did a drawing on my pc of what I saw , sorry the drawing is crude I did it with my mouse . This is the fifth time since January that my girlfriend and I have seen something over the river here ."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17882.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17882.html"],"Summary":"Object over Tennessee River.","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 50 other sightings in Knoxville","There were no other sightings in Knoxville on or around July 5th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.969368,+-83.919149(17882)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17882) map </A>"}
