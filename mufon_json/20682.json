I was star gazing as I normally do. I saw a satellite moving across the sky moving from the North to the South and told my buddy hey look its a satellite. As it passed Jupiter on the left, heading North the Dot grew to the size of a golf ball brighter than Jupiter but in a dull orange color, then dimmed to a dot, a few seconds later it grew but only half the size as before, this time as it dimmed it looked as if it split into four different object and all went in compass direction, N,S,E,W only this time they never brightened again. At first, I thought it was a reentry or something skipping off the atmosphere, but that doesn't happen like that, and it was to slow for a meteor. I am an amateur Astronomer and have never seen anything like that."],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Lake Charles","There were no other sightings in Lake Charles on or around November 2nd 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Region":"Louisiana","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/23/2009 06:18 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.228105,+-93.214476(20682)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20682) map </A>"}
