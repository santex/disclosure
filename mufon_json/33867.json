In fact as bright as the moon gets bigger than a star looks. White in color travelling SE from the north out over Pirt Phillip bay. As soon as I got home I grabbed my video camera and tripod, climbed on the roof of house. It had moved further away but could still see it. I set up camera and videoed it, by this stage I could not see it with a naked eye but it was clear through camera. It was diamond and pulsating, it appears to have a pattern of faint lines like crop circles in it. It morphed into 5 separate lights all pushing and changing shape. I got 10 minutes on video. This was about 9.30 pm on the 6th of December 2011 Melbourne Australian time"]}
