There was very heavy cloud cover so I am sure it was not a star or a satellite. I also ad my scanner on in my truck set to the aircraft frequencies and there seemed to be no local traffic in the area. I got off the nearest exit (#4) and the orange sphere dimmed on and off while it traveled from North East to the South East. As a person with aeronautics experience, I can say with great certainty this was not an aircraft. I ave emailed my friend who works at Morgantown Airport (KMGW) to see if he had anything strange on radar tonight."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.637526,+-79.949347(15438)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15438) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15438.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15438.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Round orange disk traveling from North West to South East.","Tags":"City"}
