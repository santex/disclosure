We had just layed back and were looking up at the stars when all of a suddon there was a very fast object in the sky. I pointed it out and asked the other person do you see that? It was moving very quickly we both sat up. It was in our sight for about 7-10 seconds. It was moving from north to south. The object was triangle shaped with the edges rounded. It reminded us of the movie the pretato be cause it appeared to be see through and I guess a better word for it was cloaked. however the very front of it had lights or was glowing. The glowing could have been because of the haze. There were light clouds in the area. We were outside for another hour in hopes of seeing it again. Other then shooting stars we saw nothing. We have never seen anything like it until we ran into the house and started searching on the interet and saw a video of a cloaked booerang. It was very similar if not identical!!"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.435","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"12/05/2010 01:11 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/04/2010 08:50 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26856.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26856.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-105.062041","City":"Littleton","Summary":"Very fast triangle-shaped boomerang-like object flying south toward Colorado Springs with cloaked glowing lights in front"}
