I noticed the three circular lights and said; Mom look at those beautiful three lights. I didn't relate it to being UFO's that evening. I said, that represents the holy trinity or three angels. Mom answered; No, those represent the three children you are going to have. At the time I was pregnant which weeks later resulted in a miscarriage. :( I didnt' notice the perfect circular figure untill tonight when I zoomed in on the photo. THAT'S when I said OH WOW!!!! I think I caught three UFO'S in this picture. My heart started pumping and I felt chills all over. But when I look at this photo I get a sense of peace, I set this photo as my wallpaper on my cell phone, because I love those three lights with the sunset. It definitely has a meaning. The objects remained in that same spot untill the sunset. I haven't seen them again. I do hope they come back. Has anyone taking photos like these of seen anything like here in Colorado? I'd love to know."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Saturn-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/14/2009 05:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Dome","Country":"United States","Region":"Colorado","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10082009-0001","Case Number":"19856","Latitude":"39.555401","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.555401,+-105.779587(19856)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19856) map </A>","Longitude":"-105.779587"}
