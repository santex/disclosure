They were moving straight across the sky with no engine noises, no emissions. They were dark in color, brownish-black. They were moving from east to west over Ridge rd. One wing was shorter and smaller than the other, and both wings had round wing tips. They were identical to one another. I thought they seemed like some kind of ultralight gliders until I researched images on the web. There is nothing on the web that looks like these \"planes\". They were shaped just like boomerangs but there was a protruding \"bundle\" or baggage area between the wings, off toward the larger wing. I kept on going. Unfortunately I didn't have a camera with me."],"City":"Fairfield","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41295.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41295.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fairfield","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"41295","Latitude":"44.608971"}
