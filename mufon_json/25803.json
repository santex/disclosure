back yard, rochester, monroe county, new york, usa. 2. what made you first notice the object? stargazing and watching satellites and meteorites, bright flash caught my eye, followed the object to see that bright pulses were regularly spaced and faded over an approximately 2-second period from maximum brightness to base brightness, followed by approximately 6 seconds before the beginning of the next 2-second bright-to-dim phase. 3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it? satellite, due to the high speed and star-like appearance, but exceptionally fast compared to satellites with brightness that was at least as great as comparable planetary bodies visible the same evening. 4. describe the object and its actions and motions. straight-line, no deviation. 5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. became keenly alert to this object as it clearly was something unusual - i have been a stargazer, aircraft-watcher, and satellite-watcher for some number of decades and have serious credentials in both military and civilian aviation including time at government entities that describe themselves with letters, as specific as i am willing to get on a public disclosure. 6. how did you lose sight of the object? object made its last pulse\\fade cycle slightly beyond the apex of the dome of the sky, would estimate that the closest recognizable constellations to the path of travel would have been lyra and cygnus, likely passing through a portion of cygnus. no sound emanated from the object during the entire event, not unusual as it appeared to be very high altitude or orbital."],"Date of the Event":"10/10/2010 08:16 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25803.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25803.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"43.16708","City":"Rochester","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"New York","trends":["There have been 53 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around October 10th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"25803","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-77.609362","Summary":"Probable hypersonic aircraft sighting of terrestrial origin by individual with military and civilian aviation credentials"}
