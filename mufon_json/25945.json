As I came around back of one of the buildings I looked up at the moon that was visible even though it was not dark out. As I did that I spotted 2 what looked like cylinders or bars flying at the same speed, at first I thought they were airliners or helicoperts but they made no sounds and usually you can hear planes and helicopters at this height. I also thuoght it was odd how they flew in a perfect line and seemed to be travelling at exactly the same spped. I radioed my co-worker hoping he could see them on the buildings camera system but unfortunatly he could not get a good camera angle. I watched as they disappeared into a cloudy area of the sky. Then as I turned around I looked up to see another flying object that was black in color with 4 flashing lights on it. They did not look like the normal lights you would see on a commercial airliner."],"trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Ottawa","There were no other sightings in Ottawa on or around October 17th 2010"],"Tags":"City","City":"Ottawa","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25945.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25945.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-75.692093"}
