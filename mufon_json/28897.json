I noticed a very strange \"ancient lunar ruin\" while scanning over the surface with my telescope. This temple is massive if scaling of the moon is correct. You can see huge steps leading up to the \"T-shaped\" entrance of the temple. A strange cubed structure sits in back of the entrance. Either something is living on the moon now, or was many years ago. Pictures of the lunar surface can be hoaxed, but this video footage is raw and very clear. This may not be a UFO sighting, but it definitely could answer a lot of questions, or maybe raise some!!!!!!"],"Date of the Event":"Unknown","Latitude":"29.954336","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28897.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28897.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-90.065702","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.954336,+-90.065702(28897)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28897) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05012011-0015","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in New Orleans","There were no other sightings in New Orleans on or around","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"New Orleans","Summary":"Alien lunar temple located on lunar surface","Case Number":"28897","Region":"Louisiana","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
