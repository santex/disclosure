Quietly, a UFO-shaped cylinder flew me silently. A very white came from the craft. It was beautiful and pleasant to contemplate. A sweet strong magnetic field connects me with the UFO, I had the impression of floating. I welcomed the UFO and offered a smile. He took some time before realizing what had happened. Unfortunately, a UFO ever returned as close to me. No fear in me ... only pure sweetness of this event. I hope the military will have a more open mind than sending warplanes in pursuit of UFOs. I understand that the military could try to understand what goes into their airspace, but there is nothing to fear from them, quite the contrary, I think we can trust these visitors and that we could get to work Overall the construction of a better world. For example, if we could work with them to stop the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico? We do not have any official institution to accommodate these visitors, what are we waiting for?"],"trends":[""],"Summary":"Very bright white cylinder at close range","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"23523","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.942646,+-73.542016(23523)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23523) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Latitude":"52.942646","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"05/27/2007 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.542016"}
