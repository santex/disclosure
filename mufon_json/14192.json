This is a no flight corridor as it is over the Diableo Canyon Nuclear Plant so I was amazed to see anything there! The whole thing was gone in less than a minute, fortunately I had my camera in my shirt pocket as I was going to take a picture of the sunset. This must be some new military craft as I am a pilot myself and I know No-One in his right mind would fly that corridor!"],"City":"San Luis Obispo","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-12022008-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.286122,+-120.650306(14192)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14192) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
