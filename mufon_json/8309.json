{"divs":["Sighting DetailsPlease see attached diagram. At approximately 9 p.m. on March night, I was at work. I was outdoors when I noticed what I thought was an approaching jetliner coming in from the east and preparing for a landing at either the San Jose or San Francisco airport. I typically watched that flight corridor whenever I was outdoors. I am constantly looking at the sky (I am an amateur astronomer. The single object I saw that night was stationary when I first noticed it. I did not see any other lights that are normally seen as aircraft approach at night. I watched it hover for roughly 90 seconds, then it started to travel forward and to a lower altitude (about 2 seconds elapse time), at which point it instantly reversed directions and flew off into the night sky ��� disappearing in the distance as it blinked out of sight. I saw it appear smaller and smaller in the short second or so before it disappeared. One night roughly 4-5 weeks after my sighting, I was listening to the radio program coast to coast when a woman called in to report she had seen and object in the night sky at about the same time and date that I that I had experienced. I don't usually listen to coast to coast because i have little time, but I do have quiet interest in the ufo phenomenon. I have had other sightings before but this was the best of all. Some other sightings included 4 or 5 disks travelling in a straight line formation silhouetted against a full moon as I looked at it through a telescope (i documented this sightings with sketches and notes- date: circa 1977 ), ���v��� formations in the night sky, a cylinder from a distance, a thick fluffy roughly spherical cloud that I video taped and that disappeared in the time that it took for me to switch my camera to photo-mode (about 3 seconds), and a cigar shaped craft when I was very young. I certify that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and i hope i have provided all the necessary information.
