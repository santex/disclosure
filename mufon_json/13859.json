Look out the window more and this strange looking object blinking blue, red and a white color is outside. Its off to the east towards Watervile and the longer you watch the stranger it seems. Makes sudden smooth moves, some times in half circles. I latter notice legitimate looking planes and lots of them, some moving close to the object. I heard around 5 jets over this time period, odd for night time in rural Maine. When I went out side, it seemed the teardropish object had something sticking out to my right, it seemed to move closer at times. It never scared me, but I got a sense it was watching something and the other planes where sent into, to look into the matter. Lost sight when I feel asleep around 1 AM, woke up at around 3 it was gone. It moved from time to time, but stayed in the same area roughly."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/19/2008 11:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Maine","Longitude":"-69.829444","Summary":"Object towards the east darts around in the same area for about 2 hours, does not look or act like a plane","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Smithfield","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"11/19/2008 11:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13859.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13859.html"]}
