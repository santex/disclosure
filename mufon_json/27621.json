One star looked extra bright so I got the binoculars and looked at the star. It started to change shape and color. Three distinct shapes it made are: 1. Jellyfish with long dangling tentacles reaching earthward. 2. A large round shaped diamond with red lights around the perimeter and over the top surface of the diamond. 3. A face with eyes and a mouth that moved as if speaking and the expression seemed stern. The star object continued to change shape and moved further away and came closer to earth. It seemed to move with the earth���s rotation in a westward direction. There was a second star in the west out over our marsh area and it was much closer to the earth and had a dimmer light shining from it than the first star described here. It also appeared to change its shape when viewed through binoculars. This object moved closer to the first star in a south east direction. My mom, dad and sister viewed the stars and I called into the Marinette Sheriff���s Department. They sent an officer over to investigate. He thought it was something but could not determine what it was. At times the object looked web like or faceted like a diamond with a hole in the center. It would change into a disk like figure and tip to the side so that one would see the edge as if looking at the edge of a coin. It had white and blue and red lights around its perimeter that moved and changed. I have not heard of any weather satellites that change colors and shapes. Last summer, 2010 my mother and I viewed a UFO hovering just above the tree tops over our pond and marsh area. There are no houses in that area for miles and no one ever goes into the marsh. It is to the west of our home. It was oval shaped and had white lights all around the edge. It danced and tipped itself on edge and the lights changed colors of white, red and blue. It shot a white beam of light just over my head as I was standing outside viewing it. I noticed it at about the same time and for the same length of time. It had numerous claw-like feet around the edge of the oval shape that looked like landing feet. They were not sharp but flat and shaped like a gold bar with a half gold bar size and shape for the under joint foot pad part. It seemed to be white in color or silver white. The odd thing is that our satellite tv and internet were not working. It was a clear night and there should not have been any disturbances from the weather."],"Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date of the Event":"02/02/2011 08:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/03/2011 02:19 UTC","City":"Crivitz","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27621.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27621.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
