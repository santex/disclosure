We see satellites quite often where we live and that is what I thought I was looking at. But this object was going straight then it would go from side to side like in a zigzag pattern then it would go in a straight line and zigzag again. It did this for about four minutes and was out of site. I thought I was imagining it , but my wife could also see it.It was at 8;41 pm and went from south to north. Lots of activity going on up there. Approximately 2 weeks before I watched a satellite looking object travel for a bit then stop. It did this over and over. It went from north to south. Both times straight over head."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32134.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32134.html"]}
