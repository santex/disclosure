(about an hour before the images of the objects were taken, i was 5 miles or so closer to where the objects seem to be in the images, taking photos at mckee bridge. both of my camera batteries died suddenly within 30 seconds of each other. there are 2 witnesses to that. we left the area so i could find a place to charge the batteries. once we left the area, i turned the cameras back on and the batteries were showing full charges again.) i did not notice the objects while in the area. i think the circular polarizer lens on my camera helped block glare from the intense sun and haze, so my camera could see what my eye could not. when i first saw them in the images, i thought the white sphere was a cloud and then when i zoomed in, i saw a shadow, like a sphere would have and it made sense with the direction of the sun. i had also never seen a cloud look what appeared to be perfectly round. then i checked the image i had taken moments before the one i initially noticed the sphere in and there was what i though looked like a dark line in the sky - stick like. the shutter speed i was using was so fast that it would have photographed a plane clearly and the object is too far away to be a bug or debrie that flew by quickly. even then, my camera would have showed it more of a see-through blur rather than a solid object."],"Date Submitted":"04/21/2011 08:14 UTC"}
