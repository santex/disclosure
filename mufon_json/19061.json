I am 65 years old and retired from the USAF and have seen the SR-71 flying and this thing was much faster. The altitude was very high, I could see any object nor was the any sonic boom. It was travelling in a southeasterly direction and finally disappeared over the horizon."],"Summary":"Something very fast across the sky","Date of the Event":"09/03/2009 06:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Clarkston","There were no other sightings in Clarkston on or around September 3rd 2009"],"Region":"Washington","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19061.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19061.html"]}
