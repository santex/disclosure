It seemed to be highly reflective of the sunlight and seemed to be moving from west to east. About 30 minutes later I noticed what looked like a spray plane traveling in the same path and direction at a high rate of speed and flashing some type of light or laser off the bottom of it. Within 15 minutes of the spraying the sky was a complete white out. Total elapsed time from first to last photograph is 49 minutes."],"Region":"Wisconsin","Case Number":"22758","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
