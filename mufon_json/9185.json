I thought this to be odd because usually at that time of night I would see lights coming from the west going towards the east to the airport. These are fairly odvious because they typically decend from the west towards the east and quite clearly an airplane. But the light I saw that night traveled from the south east to the north west fairly quick almost like it was crashing. It stopped like it hung in the air for about ten seconds and then departed to the south at a very rapid speed, disapearing in aproximatley 5 seconds. When the object turned the lights where still as bright going towards the south as it was when it was heading north."],"Case Number":"9185","Date Submitted":"01/21/2008 11:20 UTC","Longitude":"-78.855278","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/21/2008 11:20 UTC","City":"Tonawanda","Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.981389,+-78.855278(9185)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9185) map </A>","Summary":"Streaking across sky","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01232008-0013","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"New York","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Tonawanda","There were no other sightings in Tonawanda on or around January 21st 2008"],"Latitude":"42.981389"}
