It was morning. I looked up and saw the UFO. I first thought it was sometime of plane from the first glance. But it was not. I soon realized what it Was, this has happened before. There was one at first and then three others to follow that came out of no where. I ran inside to get my cell phone, to snap a picture. But when I came back it was completely gone. The other time I saw this was in October of 2011. It was at night and I was with my mother driving. The UFOs moved just like they did that morning when I saw them for the second time. The first time they looked like fire balls in the sky and hovered slowly in a triangular shape together. When I saw them that morning I knew it was exactly what we saw in October."],"Log Number":"US-06222012-0020","Region":"Oklahoma","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39722.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39722.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"06/22/2012 11:08 UTC","Latitude":"35.417696","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Choctaw","There was one other sighting in Choctaw on or around June 18th 2012"],"Summary":"In the morning, UFO was sauser/sphere like, silver, gray.","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
