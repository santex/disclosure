Noticed 3 bright unusual lights over Tampa Bay that hadn't been there earlier in night or on other nights. My wife and I saw them while outside hotel so I went to room and filmed them from the balcony. Have no idea what they were. There is an airport nearby I believe but these lights stayed pretty much in one area above the bay most of the time (at least 30 minutes). I dont know if they could have been helicopters searching the bay but they didn't seem like that to us. I have attached a picture that came from the video I took. It is of one of the objects when it is orange. I have about 10 minutes of HD video of them, although it gets pretty shaky at times."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"3 Rrange orbs..changed to bright white, irregular shape, with flashing lights on side","Date of the Event":"03/10/2012 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"St Petersberg","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.670327,+-81.512254(38203)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38203) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/17/2012 02:58 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05172012-0012"}
