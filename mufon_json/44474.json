We were on our way back to my house when I noticed a strange red light hovering in the sky. I asked him if he knew what it was. We observed it hovering in place, then moving to the right and then back again to the left, which startled me. I knew this wasn't a plane or a helicopter because it seemed much too low, made too sudden movements, and was silent. Satellites tend to blink or move in one path, this slowly moved back and forth and had a steady, non-blinking light. After about a minute or so of this, it passed over some trees and faded away. We ran down the highway to catch a glimpse of it again, but it was gone."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
