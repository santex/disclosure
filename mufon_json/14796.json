I happened to look up and saw what appeared to be a weird circular formation of stars. As I watched, I realized it was one big object and there were smaller light blue lights on the object's periphery slowly revolving around a bigger light blue light in the center. I ran in the house, grabbed my digital camera, turned the flash off and took a quick picture. As I was preparing to take a second shot, the UFO disappeared straight up in the sky at an unbelievable speed. Location: my back driveway Camera: Canon Powershot S-50 5.0 megapixel Object: was moving south-east to north-west at a very slow rate directly over our neighborhood Noise: absolutely none Feelings: surprised, intrigued"],"City":"Pittsburgh","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14796.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14796_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14796_submitter_file2__UFOrev1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14796_submitter_file3__UFOrev2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14796_submitter_file4__SaturationUFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14796_submitter_file5__CYMKContrastUFO2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14796.html"]}
