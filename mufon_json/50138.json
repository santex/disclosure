I seen something in the corner of my eye. Looked up and I saw the first object. I told everyone to look. It went straight then zig zag, went straight and it was getting faint as it proceeded straight. Once that one disappeared another ne apart. The next one did zig zag but by as much. It moved faster than the first one. Then it disappeared in the Sam spot as the first one. First everyone thought it was a airplane but then it zig zag and the was only on light and it was bright red.we were all creeped out about it. I did take a video of the second one."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
