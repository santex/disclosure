As I got out of the car, I looked up 88% angle to the east and I saw a bright, round object about 35,000 feet (or aircraft cruising height). Then four more objects, round but not as bright, joined the main larger object. They made a perfect triangle shape and hovered. Objects break apart briefly, moved fast to the west and joined together in an upside down triangle as one hovered then moved slightly northwest, hovered and moved slowly back to the east. Two objects shot off at a very fast speed. Three stayed side by side, then another shot off. Only two remained; the large, bright object and the smaller duller on. The large object pulsated. It was very bright. By this time, about 4:00 PM, I saw two jets approach out the northeast toward the objects, which, at that time, sped off at what I can only estimate at about 17,000 ��� 18,000 miles per hour and out of sight. The jets then turned around and headed back to the northeast. My brother, Joe Goforth, also witnessed the objects. This statement is true and accurate."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"03/29/2008 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"10194","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Taylor","There were no other sightings in Taylor on or around March 29th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
