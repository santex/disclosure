We saw a orange orb slowly going across the sky, below the clouds. It was absolutely silent and moved in one direction. After getting about halfway across the sky, it fizzled out and disappeared. About 20 mins later, 2 more orbs appeared out of the same direction. One seemed to follow the other one. The first orb made it all of the way across the sky and out of sight, while the other seemed to fizzle out and disappear. Our whole family (6 people) witnessed the 2nd instance with us. I found out that the clouds were at an altitude of 6000-7000 feet, so that gives a good idea at how low to the ground these objects were....they were definitely below the clouds."],"Case Number":"18025","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-83.133821","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around July 11th 2009"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07112009-0016","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.680588,+-83.133821(18025)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18025) map </A>"}
