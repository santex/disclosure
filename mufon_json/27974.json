I thought it was a comet of some sort, maybe made of copper since it burnt green, until it vanished. It was bright geenish blue and it had what looked like chunks breaking off in tiny fireballs. It looked like a giant firework but it was shot down at the earth not up into the sky. The whole incedent only lasted between 10 and 20 sec but the object seemed to vanish when it got to around 10000 feet. There was no more fire but when it vanished it looked like spikes comming from where it dissapeared. I couldnt explain anything. i was awestruck and got the chills."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"27974","Summary":"Green Fire Ball fell out of the sky from 25000 feet and disapeared at 10000 feet","Latitude":"39.621381"}
