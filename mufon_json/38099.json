This object was moving at least two times as fast as the plane. I recognized that the object was not following the curve of the earth. It traveled in a straight line and continued until it faded and left the atmosphere. Objects that are entering the atmosphere will fall and light up as they burn. The light was steady like illumination."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38099.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38099.html"],"Case Number":"38099","Summary":"Object entered in apmosphere and then left"}
