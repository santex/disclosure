It was very bright and it was moving all over the sky. At first I thought it was a firework but then I saw it moving all over the place and at that point I knew it was a UFO. The ufo was very bright and was moving very fast and moved all over the sky. It then shot straight into the sky until I could not see it anymore. When I realized what it was I freaked with excitement and I ran home and just thought to myself about how lucky I was to be able to see such fenonima. Like I said the UFO shot straight up into the sky until it was out of sight."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"3598","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3598.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3598.html"],"Latitude":"39.377329","Date of the Event":"07/19/2004 09:16 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Parkville","There were no other sightings in Parkville on or around July 19th 2004"],"Longitude":"-76.539688","Region":"Maryland","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.377329,+-76.539688(3598)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3598) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/19/2004 09:16 UTC","Summary":"bright light moving very fast moving in many directions and then shot into the sky until unseen.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
