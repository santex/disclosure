I was driving from a client site on Research Dr. when I looked up and saw what appeared to be a large shard of metal in the sky. It was tilted at a 50-60 degree angle. Much more then a plane taking off. It kinda just appeared then got really reflective and faded away. I couldn't make out any windows and it was probably within 2-3 miles of my sight."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42455.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42455.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/10/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.787231,+-119.416162(42455)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42455) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-09102012-0027","Summary":"UFO Tilted Like A Shard of Metal Above Irvine","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-119.416162","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
