The light pulsated and then it disappeared. I was bummed out cause I didn't catch it on video. Then as soon as I thought that, the copper light appeared hovering below the mountain then slowly move around and back up in the air. This time I grabbed my cell phone and got it on video. I am writing this shortly after capturing this UFO in hopes others may have seen the same thing. There is no cgi involved nor is this a hoax of any nature. I have the original left on my phone. Phone is a Samsung Galaxy S 4g.
