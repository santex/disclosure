It was around noon I turned toward the window looked up at the sky moving towards me in a curved line about 50 to 150 feet in the sky not more than I saw something black on the front of the sphere then it spun in a circle without moving from the spot it was in. I saw it for a few seconds then for reasons unknown I looked away. When I looked back it wasn't there. When I first saw it I thought it was a satellite or camera. It was about a foot to 15 inches in diameter inches in circumference. I remember thinking as though I was being watched I stopped moving for a brief moment then walked to the window to get a better look for a few seconds before I turned away."],"Latitude":"41.244547","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.244547,+-80.810117(22108)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22108) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/30/2004 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22108.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22108.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-03032010-0009","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"03/03/2010 06:37 UTC","City":"Warren","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Warren","There were no other sightings in Warren on or around November 30th 2004"],"Region":"Ohio","Disposition":"Hoax","Case Number":"22108","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
