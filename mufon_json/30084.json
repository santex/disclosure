{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI live on a hill, in an area where I have an impressive view of the city and a window that takes up my entire wall. I was sitting on my bed on my laptop. Around 7:00 pm, I glanced out my window and saw what I initially thought was a plane, because I saw a light on it's tail end. I got up to get a closer look and watched it fly over the city slowly before stopping in midair and disappearing. It hovered for maybe a minute before completely vanishing; it didn't get smaller like it was going off into the distance, it just vanished."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/09/2011 07:00 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Longitude":"-104.817893","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.842212,+-104.817893(30084)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30084) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07102011-0002","Object Shape":"Cigar","Country":"United States","Summary":"Silver cigar floated across the city and then disappeared","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","City":"Colorado Springs","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30084.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30084.html"],"Case Number":"30084","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There were no other sightings in Colorado Springs on or around July 9th 2011"],"Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"38.842212","Date Submitted":"07/10/2011 01:50 UTC"}
