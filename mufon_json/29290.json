{"City":"Port Republic","Latitude":"39.520673","Summary":"Bright red glowing object in the sky that dimmed and flew away quickly","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy boyfriend and I were driving to my house in a town called Port Republic, NJ. (small town) My boyfriend noticed first and I noticed about two seconds afterwards. It was a bright red glowing object in the sky. It was really bright and there were no flashing lights like a plane or anything like that. I hit the brakes to get a better look and try to get a picture but just as I did that the object stopped glowing so bright and became a dull red dot. Then took off and disappeared behind the tree line. I couldn't quite tell how high up in the sky it was. I'd say it was higher up than a plane, but my boyfriend thinks it was lower. He did see it first. I was truly freaked by this."],"Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29290.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29290.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Port Republic","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"05/28/2011 09:50 UTC","Case Number":"29290","Object Shape":"Fireball","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.520673,+-74.485707(29290)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29290) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-74.485707","Log Number":"US-05282011-0012","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/28/2011 09:16 UTC","Region":"New Jersey","Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
