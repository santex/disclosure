I was driving my SUV and friend was in the passenger's seat. I was about 3 miles from Farmersville and I happened to glance to my left and noticed a white object in the sky. It was not a plane or bird and I kept wondering what the heck it was. It appeared and disappered a few times. I kept asking my friend if she saw it and at first she said no. I slowed down to about 10 miles an hour and while I was looking West she finally saw it appear North of us and then it was gone. The object was a white skinny oval is the best I can describe it."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Farmersville","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/26/2008 12:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Farmersville","There were no other sightings in Farmersville on or around April 26th 2008"],"Log Number":"US-04282008-0010","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.165499,+-96.357892(10585)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10585) map </A>","Longitude":"-96.357892","Region":"Texas","Latitude":"33.165499"}
