I heard the sound of a low level Jet. I like taking pictures of low flying planes over my house. So I grabbed my camera fast and went outside. Facing South West from My yard in North Manchester, I noticed an A-10 flying to the west from the east. I took a quick picture with my camera and put the camera down..Then I noticed 3 white balls going the same direction as the plane. They didnt really didnt look like they were following the plane..but it was the same direction..East to West. The balls were at an angle. After seeing this very quickly..I went to switch my Camera to video..looked back up...and didnt see the A-10 or white balls. The whole experience lasted maybe 3 or 4 seconds. Weather was clear and Temp. was 77 degrees. Im not sure if these were UFO's or maybe something the A-10 had done..but thought I would report it. I did get lucky and caught the balls on my digital camera."]}
