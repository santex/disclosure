(I drive a cab for a living) I saw a large, orange ball of light in the sky at about 40 degrees from horizon. It would take a quarter at arms length to cover it. It hovered in the same place for about 60 seconds, flared up and got brighter for a second or two, s and then dimmed in and out for a couple seconds. It did this a few times. The final time it started to get brighter, it began to move and suddenly then shot really fast to the east. I watched it until it was out of my sight."],"Summary":"Large orange ball of light","Region":"Indiana","Date of the Event":"07/05/2011 02:45 UTC","Longitude":"-86.125573","trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in Kokomo","There were no other sightings in Kokomo on or around July 5th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"07/06/2011 11:52 UTC"}
