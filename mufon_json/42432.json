I was driving down highway 7 going west when in the corner of my eye i noticed a bright light but disappeared right away leaving only with a ghost trail behind it. I quickly jumped a bit and kind of played it off at first, shortly after on the other side of my windshield, I recognized a bright orb a few seconds then it shot in the same direction heading quickly west. As soon as the second one passed I turned my head to my boyfriend, without saying anything to him he told me \"Yeah, I seen it .\" I asked if he seen them both but he only seen the first one that I did, and neither of the friends in back knew what we were talking about."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Two objecta flashed across the sky in the same direction on opposite sides of the sky.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09102012-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.921061,+-93.473279(42432)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42432) map </A>","Object Shape":"Flash","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.473279","Date of the Event":"09/03/2012 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"44.921061","Region":"Minnesota","Tags":"City","Case Number":"42432"}
