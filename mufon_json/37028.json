I knew right away it was not a plane because it stated at a tiny light and not far at all from where I was and it glowed very brightly as it came over us. By the time it glowed I had called many people to come see it. Everyone saw it. I was extremely excited. 2 people were skeptical but knew it wasn't a plane. It went so far in a straight line that it disappeared like a tiny white dot. It did pulsate but not like an airplane. It's hard to explane but nothing here from earth."]}
