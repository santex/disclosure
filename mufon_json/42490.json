She looked up into the distance and automatically called for me and my younger sister to look at the UFO's. We automatically knew what they were because our neighbor has told us about them before and told us his theory of them having a base in the oceans and he shared how, on a clear night they would go in various directions. They looked like red-orange lights surrounded by star-like UFOS that blink and pulsate and conceal themselves in clusters to resemble constellations. Tonight was the first time I have witnessed them and they left me baffled, curious, and anxious. It faded away into the distance and I'm now worried about whether or not it will turn into some \"Signs\" thing, but these aliens not being allergic to water. They affected my cell phone and it kept shutting off and my neighbor tried starting his car for 5 minutes and it would not come on."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.839011,+-81.162204(42490)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42490) map </A>","trends":[],"Summary":"multiplying, multicolored lights moving in different directions and trying to conceal themselves like stars","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-09112012-0024","Date of the Event":"09/11/2012 08:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
