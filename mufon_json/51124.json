I was just looking up at the shy and saw something flying it got my attention because of how big it is there aren't any air ports in my town. I tried to figure out what it was but i had no idea what it was it had no visible motor wings or propellers to support flight and it was up high enough that it wasn't a remote controlled toy and it was in the air for at least two three minutes before me and my buddy lost sight of it. It was cream sickle orange rectangle with what looked like a bubble or force field around it it was flying in a straight path. It made me feel a little uneasy i din't know what it was or what was gona happen next. i really wanted to snap a picture of it but it was to high up in the air for 2.0 mega pixel camera i had at the time on my phone"],"Latitude":"40.685249","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.685249,+-75.225856(51124)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51124) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
