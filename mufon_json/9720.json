The skies were clear of clouds. The craft glowed a orange-yellow. The underside of the craft appeared to be charred like that of a space capsule. The craft flew completely silent about 100-200 feet in the sky. I estimate the craft was 1000 feet from me and about 30'-40' in diameter. The event only lasted about 2 minutes from the time it dropped from the sky. I had just finished mowing the grass at the church on 131 near Newtonsville. I felt started when I saw it."],"Latitude":"40.422397","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Witnessed a disked shaped UFO over Newtonsville Ohio","Case Number":"9720","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Region":"Ohio","trends":[],"Longitude":"-82.901613","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/30/1985 02:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-02262008-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9720.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9720.html"]}
