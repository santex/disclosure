should we call 911?\" i said, \"i don't know. they'll probably just think we're drunk or crazy.\" so the two us grabbed our stuff and headed into the house. we were both in utter disbelief & excited at we saw and we kept talking about it. i then picked up my phone and told my friend what i saw. next, both of us posted on facebook what had just happened. initially, i stated on facebook that i thought the ufo was at an altitude of 500 feet, but after i thought about it for awhile, i estimated the craft was probably twice that. my girlfriend and i were so excited about what we had seen we couldn't fall asleep. at 12:45 am we were still talking about it and in the morning it was the very first thing we discussed. as a back ground note, i am very familiar with seeing all types of aircraft fly, and i have been to many military and civilian air shows. i have even been in a military flight simulator for a rc-135. i have seen every plane fly in the us military and i have seen f-18's, and f-16's fly super sonic. so i know, and am very familiar with, the silhouette of all military aircraft, including the flight characteristics, size and aircraft speed."],"Longitude":"-90.177158","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Marshfield","There were no other sightings in Marshfield on or around October 27th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Wisconsin","Summary":"Massive black perfect triangle with dim red lights at points (non flashing), we could see craft very well.","Date of the Event":"10/27/2011 10:35 UTC","Case Number":"32926","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10282011-0010"}
