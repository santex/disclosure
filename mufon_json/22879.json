{"divs":["sighting detailson april 18th at about 12:00am 7 round objects were flying in the sky. they made no noise at all. my boyfriend was leaving my house, then he called me on the cell phone and said to come out side. i went out and he pointed to the sky. there was all these roundish objects. they were lit up kind of orange and it seemed something was spinning around it. the color changed or flashed in the middle of it (blue\\white). two of them stayed the left and got really close together and separated again. they darted up and to the side and came together again. coincidentally there was what looked like a falling star that came flying down and disappeared. one was moving independently. 4 of them that were to the right started making formations. they made a triangular formation and held position. then they separated and took off in different directions. they came together again in a straight line formation. they separated again and came together in a circular formation then separated in different directions. they disappeared behind the clouds in the sky going up. we could barely see them through the clouds for a little while. then one came back down through the clouds and held it's position. again, there was no noise at all coming from any of these objects. we watched it and it started moving again up and over the direction of what looked like the 405 freeway. past carnegie middle school. i live in carson california and i am not sure how far these objects were from my city. they were very clear. and big. the neighbor looked out his window at us and i pointed to the sky and he looked and came outside. his wife watched from her porch. the neighbor watched with us for about 10 minutes. the object went up into the sky higher and higher up until it disappeared. we walked back towards the house and we were talking about how amazing it was then 1 of them came back but it stayed pretty high up in the sky it traveled straight then it appeared to slow way down. from my viewpoint it looked like it almost stopped. then it went straight up slowly though the clouds it went higher until it disappeared. at 12:10 i called the carson sheriff station and reported it. i tried to record it on the ipod nano but it couldn't from that distance. i have about 35 minutes of audio while trying to record it in the sky it 1 was about 10 minutes another was 20 minutes and a couple were about 2 minutes long. each time i tried to record it, it could not pick up the objects. they were very big. they were about the size of the moon when the moon is out. one time one of the objects moved really fast all the way across the sky. there were 2 small planes that had past by towards the end of the sighting. the planes did make noise. and they had the typical light that airplanes have and traveled in a flight pattern that planes fly. these objects were bigger than those planes and they were farther away. these planes had to have seen something. one was going one direction. then later the other was going a different direction. again, the planes did make noise. the objects did not make any noise at all. it was very quiet. i could hear the insects chirping. this went on for so long, that someone else besides us and the neighbors, had to have seen it. the formations that they made were incredible. it was also incredible how close they would get to each other and then hold their positions. we were not scared. we were just really amazed and excited. i don't think they were here to harm anyone or anything. please, if anyone else saw this, can you come forward and let us know what you saw. i was viewing this from carson california 90745 usa (la county area) this event lasted about an hour. thank you"],"Date Submitted":"04/18/2010 04:35 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.839406","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22879.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22879.html"],"City":"Carson","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04182010-0004","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California","Summary":"7","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-118.277266","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Carson","There were no other sightings in Carson on or around April 18th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.839406,+-118.277266(22879)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22879) map </A>","Case Number":"22879","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Date of the Event":"04/18/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change"}
