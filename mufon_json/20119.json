There were two lights in the middle and one each on the outside of the middle lights about 5 feet out They were in a straight row and kind of looked like headlights. They did not blink. While I and others were watching an additional set of lights started out from the middle in a straight line til' they joined with the outside lights and then shot back to the middle and then it was gone. What blows me away is that nobody said anything about it to anyone there . I believe I remember asking the person I was sitting with if they saw it but we never talked about it. Like it was something you see everyday or you have no reason to talk about it. I don't remember fear but I do remember feeling surprise. I wonder too about the lack of discussion with anyone as we were not alone on that stretch of beach."]}
