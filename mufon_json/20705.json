At first I thought it was a helicopter . But it had no sound coming from it , not an engine or a jet and no sound from rotor blades . Under it , it had two sets of triagler bright red lights , three lights in each set , one set in the front and the other in the back . Also it had white lights on the right side of it . It was moving slow maybe 20 mph or less , and the height was about 200 feet or so and it was about 600 feet to my left . As it traveled down the river , it looked like it was following the bends of the river . till it fadded out of sight . Total time of the sighting was about 2 minutes . Again no planes or helicopters fly up or down the river . They fly the banks and cross the river , but never drectly over it ."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20705.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20705.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"11/24/2009 11:04 UTC"}
