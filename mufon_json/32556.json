{"Longitude":"-81.286979","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on my balcony smoking a cigarette talking to my boyfriend about the sky and stars when I saw what I thought was a plane in the sky. I noticed there were only 6 straight lights. I got up, walked to the edge of my balcony to see what these lights were. There was no \"form\" to them. They were just 6 bright lights in the sky. There were in a straight line horizontally. They were moving E.S.E. pretty fast. One light did fall out of formation before rejoining the group. I lost sight when they traveled too far for me to see them anymore. The lights were as bright as those \"euro white\" headlights you see on the cars these days. There was NO sound at all coming from these lights."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Sanford","Date of the Event":"10/12/2011 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-10122011-0016","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sanford","There were no other sightings in Sanford on or around October 12th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.766472,+-81.286979(32556)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32556) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"28.766472","Case Number":"32556","Date Submitted":"10/12/2011 07:51 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32556.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32556.html"],"Summary":"Like"}
