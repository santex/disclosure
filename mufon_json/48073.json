My father screamed out to me from our deck \"COME OUTSIDE NOW!!!!\". He pointed up to the sky where I saw 4 bright randomly flashing lights all in a straight line. My father and I conversed about what these lights could possibly be but could not seem to conclude that it was anything from this world. These lights began to progressively spread out until they took on the shape of a rectangle. They then proceeded to move towards the ocean at a relatively quick pace. I got chills running all down my body and began hearing an uproar of what sounded like a jet engine. The lights moved into a cloud that was just of the coast, and when it did lighting shot of in all direction for duration of about a minute. Afterwards the lightning ceased as did the clouds themselves."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.630454,+-78.961125(48073)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48073) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"4 bright lights move towards ocean, then vanish in cloud of lighting."}
