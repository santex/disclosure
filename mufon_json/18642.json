I didn't see it at first because it was stationary and I thought it was just another star. The \"star\" started moving across the sky and then moved down toward us. It's movement was on the slow side at first and it kind of sped up as it came toward us and got brighter as it came. We could see this for about 3 minutes. It actually startled my daughter and I so much, she jumped into my arms and we were heading for the door. I looked back, and it stopped abruptly, went straight back up to where it started and then sped off to my north. We watched it leave. After it was on its way to the north, it was only visible for about a minute."],"Date of the Event":"08/11/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"46.734553","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"18642","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Minnesota","Summary":"Whit light..looked like a star at first"}
