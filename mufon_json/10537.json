It hung there for a few seconds and then fell in a slightly wavering line towards the ground. In terms of size, if a normal shooting star (which this is defintiely not) were the size of a golf ball, what we saw would be equivalent to a basketball. At the time we were the only car on the highway that we could see. We both immediately fell silent and after a few more seconds both expressed total astonishment at what we'd seen. We both independently described it as looking as if the object had \"popped\" into the atmosphere from outer space and then fell to Earth."],"Date Submitted":"03/21/2008 02:00 UTC","Case Number":"10537","Longitude":"-72.587361","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/21/2008 02:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
