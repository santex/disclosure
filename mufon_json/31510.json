It caught our attention because it was so bright! This object was diamond shaped and was one solid light (kinda like a star but it was moving). We watched it move across the sky and it began to dim until it completely disappeared. I have always been a skeptic until now. Could this have been a satellite? Do satellites dim their bright lights and then completely disappear into thin air? That is the only possible explanation I can come up with but I can assure you that what we saw was not normal!"],"Case Number":"31510","trends":["There have been no other sightings in lily","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-09042011-0012"}
