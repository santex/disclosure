In the sky a star seemed to form and expand and \"explode\" (there was no sound), an expanding ring of light was left behind , much like a wake when a pebble is dropped in the water.There was no distance relationship to make, it looked initially like a star so there was a mental assumption. She has asked me about it since. I am not a believer in \"extra-terrestrials\" or \"spaceships\" , this was a phenomena I have never been able to explain, my best explanation has been some kind of missile or rocket testing in Nevada during this time period and landing in the ocean. This is not intended to \"report\" anything, I am seeking information that would connect this sighting to something ordinary."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.59129,+-122.387485(18780)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18780) map </A>","Region":"California","Latitude":"40.59129"}
