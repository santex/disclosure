My sister, my seven year old son and I were driving on Topanga Canyon Boulevard in the hills above Chatsworth. 2. It was blocking the road. 3. A vortex. 4. It hovered about a foot off the road about twenty feet in front of us. When it disappeared, it just closed up, like a cat's eye but closing from side to side. 5. My son and sister screamed. My son dove behind the driver's seat to hide, and my sister and I froze. 6. See number 4 above. I don't remember the ride home. We left around 1pm, it's a 20 minute ride, but when I got home it was dark. My sister would never discuss the event with me. That was the last time I saw her sane. She developed schizophrenia and bipolar condition."],"Case Number":"4475","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4475.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4475.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-02232006-0003","Date of the Event":"04/30/1987 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
