Just before 11 p.m. in the evening, I heard a tremendous buzzing or roaring sound. Running out, I saw a huge dirigible like craft moving from west to east. Though it resembled a blimp, it was quite unlike any blimp I have ever seen, and much larger. The roar was incredible. It continued moving from west to east until it was out of sight. NOTE: I have checked \"approximate\" time, but it was very, very close. It couldn't be off by more than 4-5 minutes."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.842023,+-118.290076(45976)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45976) map </A>","City":"West Carson","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"33.842023","Longitude":"-118.290076","Object Shape":"Blimp, Bullet, Missile"}
