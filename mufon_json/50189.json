{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was smoking a cigarette on my porch and I was obviously looking up at the stars. I noticed that it looked like a star was moving. It looked just like a bright star was moving in a straight line. This was August 24th of 2013 at about 9pm. I was watching the star like UFO move for less then 5 minutes and then I noticed that the light got dimmer and soon vanished. I didn't see any blinking lights like a normal plane makes. It looked like it was high up in the air, I thought it was a star at first and it looked just like a star that was moving. I only watched it for less then 5 minutes but I don't know what it was so I'm calling it a UFO. The light was a constant whitish light that looked like it was moving in a straight path and then the light got dimmer until it disappeared.
