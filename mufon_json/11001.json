{"divs":["sighting details i was driving west on oh rt 6 just east of miner rd when i noticed a bright circular light, like an airplane headlight, in the western sky below and to the left of my view of the big dipper. there were no flashing lights\\beacons anywhere around this light like an airplane would have. i looked up again and watched as the light dimmed. like someone had turned down a light fixture with a dimmer. in approximately 10-15 seconds the light had dimmed from looking like an airplane light to about the size of a star. i looked down at the road and when i looked back the light was gone. there were still no flashing lights in the area where i last saw the light. there is a small regional airport a few miles from where i was, but planes approaching or departing from there are so low when they pass where i was that there is no mistaking them for what they are. the light appeared to be close to the flight path for arrivals into cleveland-hopkins aiport(the path follows i-90) but the light was facing in the wrong direction, as if it was a departing flight. i'm willing to believe i could have seen a plane turning it's light off but what bothers me is that there were absolutely no flashing airplane lights in the sky after the light dimmed. also, i tried to locate the light as i continued driving and there were no airplane lights anywhere nearby."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11001.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11001.html"],"Log Number":"US-06022008-0001","Date of the Event":"06/01/2008 11:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Region":"Ohio","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Willoughby Hills","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Latitude":"41.598382","Summary":"Bright circular light dimmed then disappeared","Case Number":"11001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.598382,+-81.418447(11001)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11001) map </A>","Longitude":"-81.418447","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/01/2008 11:00 UTC","City":"Willoughby Hills"}
