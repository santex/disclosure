I was running about with another boy around my age and I remember the conversation, saying that his dad was in the airforce and he transported some space men in his plane. An additional image in my mind was that they were laying down on racks as if they were shipped. This is all I can remember and just wanted to relay that to you. If there is a person from that location and time period talking about the same thing let me know."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.024413,+-118.407547(9328)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9328) map </A>","Longitude":"-118.407547","Latitude":"34.024413","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"08/21/1953 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9328.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9328.html"],"City":"Los Angeles","Date of the Event":"08/21/1953 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Conversation","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around August 21st 1953"]}
