They hovered and circled one another then a third orange ball appered in the same spot the first one occured. within a few seconds the 2 balls came back together to become one and then all there just dissaperead. the second night i saw one orange ball break off into 2 then go back together and then dissappear. I saw it two more time between 8:30 and 10:00 pm. When it would appear and dissapear it would resemble a light being turned on but slowly. I would grow and get brighter over 1-2 sec."]}
