I had just got off shift from work. I got out and immediately noticed 2 bright objects in the southwestern sky. At first I thought they might have been planets that I had not noticed on previous mornings.The sun had not yet risen. The objects were running side by side, with one higher than the other. They were moving at a noticeable rate from the southwest to the northeast. They appeared to be as bright as any of the stars in the morning sky, with they same color. I saw no twinkling or color variations. I watched as these objects moved rapidly northeast,(they were moving as fast as I have watched satellites cross the sky) when suddenly one went left and one went right from my standpoint and seemed to disappear straight up within 4 to 5 seconds. I wss very puzzled because I had never seen anything move like these objects did. No sounds or vapor trails were heard or seen. The sky was perfectly clear, no wind, and the outside temperature was 42.4 degrees."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"25683","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
