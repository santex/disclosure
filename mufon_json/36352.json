They were driving and the white flashes emitted sequentially. They thought the object was a possible UFO yet nothing occurred after whatsoever. No sight was loss after seeing the object. Reaction's were unease, such events are not known in the area, however, due to the proximity of Northrup, SpaceX, and two airports, it's a possibility that something could have came out of those four areas. Despite this, the beam was pretty big and could be not of some normal human activity. A possibility of a meteor entering the area made a lot more sense."],"Object Flight Path":"N/A","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.91719,+-118.35031(36352)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36352) map </A>","City":"Hawthorne","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/09/2012 05:40 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03092012-0013","Case Number":"36352","Date of the Event":"03/09/2012 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hawthorne","There were no other sightings in Hawthorne on or around March 9th 2012"]}
