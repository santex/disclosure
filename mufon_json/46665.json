It seemed to wobble around in a tight circle getting bright then dim as it did so. I was excited to see something unexplainable, I immediately called my cousin and asked him to step outside and look at it, then I yelled for my girlfriend to see it. The object passed over the ridge line in front of my house as it traveled on what looked to be a straight course North East."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.25308,+-83.188308(46665)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46665) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/07/2013 08:40 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/07/2013 09:06 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"46665"}
