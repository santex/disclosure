It was close to the tree line so we thought it was some type of rescue or search helicopter, we watched it over the course of two hours as it slowly and steadily rose in the sky but remaining just as bright and seemingly motionless."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21421.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21421.html"],"Log Number":"US-01092010-0015","Date of the Event":"01/09/2010 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/09/2010 10:08 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Longitude":"-75.476019","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Tags":"City","Summary":"Super bright star like object with flashing colors","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pocono Pines","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
