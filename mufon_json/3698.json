To our left (south of us), we noticed a yellow light. It looked like a large yellow planet, although it was slightly larger than a large star or planet. We thought it was just a star or planet, because it was going the same speed as us and appeared to not be moving. But as soon as we stopped, it kept continuing on, so we could tell it was moving. So we kept an eye on it, and sure enough, as soon as we started walking, it appeared to not be moving. All of a sudden, it dissappeared, and reappeared in front of us (to the north). It was slightly larger. It wasn't blinking, like a plane or helicopter does. We could also compare it to an airplane, because in the distance, to the south of the object, we could see two airplanes. It moved to the right (south)for a little bit, then it stopped. All of a sudden, it just dissappeared completely."],"City":"Arvada","Summary":"It was a yellow light, moving slowly in the sky, dissappearing and reappering once","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Arvada","There were no other sightings in Arvada on or around July 29th 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
