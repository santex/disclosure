2:05 (appears to split); 2:26 (different orb, more yellow color); 2:32 (same structure); 2:36 (planet in background); 3:18 (different orb, same structure); 3:20 (structure, same ���crab��� shape); 3:31 (structure); 3:47 (wing shape); 4:52 (it is moving away and dimming, has appearance of crescent shape); 4:47 (strange blur and object appears to split)."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36114.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36114.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/26/2012 07:05 UTC","Summary":"Bright Red FIreballs slow straight line 3-4K ft ASL South to North","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"40.69703","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Mars","There were no other sightings in Mars on or around February 26th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball","Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Mars"}
