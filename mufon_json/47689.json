I was outside my house at about 10 pm having my last cigarette of the night. I live in an elevated area so I have a nice view of the sky. An orange light caught my attention. Then all of a sudden there were about 15 orange glowing flying objects. At that point I called my brother out to look. There were approximately 30 around that time. My mom came out as the last of the objects flew west. By that time they all went out of my line of view due to some cloudiness. I captured the last of them leaving from my iPhone. The quality sucks but you can make out some of the lights. I was too in shock to even think about filming the first swarm! My mom asked out loud \"Are we being invaded??!!\" They were flying too low and too close together to be an airplane or a helicopter. This event has made me question our whole existence but was also very intriguing."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/28/2013 01:11 UTC"}
