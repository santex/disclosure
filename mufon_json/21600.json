{"Latitude":"39.926785","divs":["Sighting DetailsHi I am 18 years old and i saw something last night that i can not explain. At 11:15 last night January 22 2010 i was walking east on a street called Porter avenue in Seaside Park New jersey, I just so happened to look up and very high up i saw lights. What i saw was 4 lights in a strait line spaced out evenly, they traveled to the north east at a constant speed they moved like that for about ten seconds then they came together extremely fast to were i could see the trails of light as they moved meeting in the center of the four lights, next the single light shot very fast in the same direction as the four were traveling and it had a trail much like a commet it disappeared not on the horizon but obviously much farther over head to the north east. thank you I spoke to a man named loran last night and he advised me to email this to you."],"Summary":"4 stars moving together and eventually changing shape.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/23/2010 02:47 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Seaside Park","There were no other sightings in Seaside Park on or around January 22nd 2010"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01232010-0009","City":"Seaside Park","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"New Jersey","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21600.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21600.html"],"Case Number":"21600","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-74.077081","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.926785,+-74.077081(21600)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21600) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/22/2010 11:15 UTC","Country":"United States"}
