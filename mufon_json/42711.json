Something outside attracted my attention and I looked out of my sitting room window and saw what initially looked like a meteor about to crash into my street. It was a fireball with a long bright tail. I raced outside to see it slow down and change its shape into a very large object with a series of lights at one end and a series of lights a little further down. It moved slowly at rooftop level down my street. Again, no sound at any time. I watched in disbelief for around 18 or more seconds as it disappeared over farmland at the end of my street. My heart was racing like mad during the whole time. I could not go indoors for a long while in case it came back, though heaven only knows what I would have done then. I called a couple of friends and texted some more but, because of the late hour, they were all asleep. I know I will not sleep tonight so I am going to make a cup of tea to calm my nerves and watch a movie and wait till it gets light. I reported it to the local police.
