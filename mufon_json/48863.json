As I was waiting I looked up to the sky and saw a larger than a star very bright orb sharped object. The direction was in the northern sky between the bottom of the big dipper and the north star. It wasn't moving when I observed it but then it moved in a north direction getting smaller the farther away it traveled. Also one second it was there, then it wasn't, then it was, then it was gone. The night was cloudless. When I first saw the object I had no thoughts on what it might or might not be, the whole experience happened in a few seconds. Afterward, I collected my thoughts I remembered seeing the same thing a few nights ago. The same area in the northern sky and the same looking object doing the same movements."],"Longitude":"-97.126701","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48863.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48863.html"],"Latitude":"32.037009","City":"Hillsboro","Date of the Event":"07/09/2013 10:50 UTC","Case Number":"48863","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Date Submitted":"07/11/2013 12:48 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Hillsboro","There were no other sightings in Hillsboro on or around July 9th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.037009,+-97.126701(48863)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48863) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
