(to my left out the car window) as i watch this bright light, another one and then another one popped in on either side of it. the new 2 were not as bright and were a little higher in the sky than the very large one. they kinda formed a triangle pattern in the sky. they were approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon. the larger one was about 35-40 degrees up. the larger one was about the size of 1\\2 a baby asprin at arms length. the other two were about half the size of the bigger one. just as soon as the 3rd one appeared and the three of them made the triangular pattern and kinda looked like they were just bobbing a bit, in sync with each other and floating there, looking all orange and sparkly bright, they popped off one at a time. first the two smaller ones popped out one at a time and then the bigger one just kinda faded into the dark.. the whole thing lasted less than a minute. funny thing was i was scanning the sky as i traveled down the road and i was just thinking it would be a perfect night to see the orange balls of light. and within seconds of having that thought, there they were! blew me away! i raced home to get my camcorder and went back out to see if i could see them again. i noticed that when i got home all the dogs in the neighborhood were howling and making strange noises. and barking like maniacs. (it is now nearly midnight and they are still out there barking their lungs out) i did not see anything when i went back out. (i think from now on i won't go anywhere without my camera!) this is the third time i have seen these lights in just a few weeks time. the weather was nice. sky was clear, lots of stars, temp was 45 degrees. no wind and no moisture. i felt excited. and a little creeped out."],"Date Submitted":"04/15/2008 09:25 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10363.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10363.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10363.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/15/2008 09:25 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-86.127843","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.490907","Region":"Indiana","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.490907,+-86.127843(10363)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10363) map </A>","Summary":"3 orange balls of light"}
