We observed a large spotlight in the back of my grandparent's pasture, which was across the street from my parents land. The light covered about an acre and was very bright. Everything this light touched in a white out. You couldn't see the grass it was covering. The spotlight traveled up the front of Rooster Rock and then traveled quickly over the Methow Hill to the R. Rock's right. The light then traveled back over the route again, back to where we first saw it. It then shrunk down until there was no light left on the ground. Until now, all of this had been observed from the car in which we were traveling. My sister and I arrived at our parents home almost as the light disappeared in my granparent's pasture. We leaped out of the car looking up into the sky to see what could have created the spotlight on the ground. There was a small while light in the sky that would have blended in with the stars had it not been moving quickly and zig-zaging. It was in our view for about ten to fifteen seconds when it just winked out. My sister and I went inside and told my parents about it. About eight to nine months later, I saw the same thing happen, only I was with one of my good friends. The same senario happend, the hill being bathed in that bright light, only this time, we didn't observe anything in the sky. I was glad when my friend saw it, because he didn't think my sister and I were crazy anymore. The first time I saw the light, I thought it was a spotlight that was being used at a new shopping centre in my home town, but if it had come from there, Wenatchee is in a valley, if the light had been able to reach my granparent's place from where that spotlight had been place, there would have been shadows. It had to come from up above. If I had known there were sites like this to tell my little story about what I had seen, I would have filled this form out eight and a half years ago!!!"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"10995"}
