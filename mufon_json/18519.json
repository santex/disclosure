I notice this object, as I was at the top of I-45 over pass going south towards Pearland, TX. I slowed down to get a closer looked at this object- it was suspended 12��� to 14��� above Dixie Farm Rd. I looked for cables or something that it could be hanging from, but nothing, it was stationary in sky on its own. I drove under it and kept going. I looked in my rear view mirror and it was still there, I know, I was not the only person that saw this object. The sky was clear ������Blue Bird Day���, something came over me- (Traumatized), I carry a camera with me all the time, which I use with my job. It���s funny; I never thought about stopping and calling 911 or take a photo of the object. When, I first saw this object, it looked like a surveillance probe; cylinder with dark windows around the top, the object was 3 to 4 feet in length, approx 10 inches in diameter. The object was stationary in a vertical stance and never moved-NO NOISE- I heard about UFO Probes before, when I got home I told my wife about what I had saw. The sky was so clear it would have made a great clear photo or movie��� I called my brother-n-law and told him what I had seen. He said he saw something like this on Discovery Channel... that the FBI and CIA...my have. This photo is the area where the probe was seen and the photo of the probe is one that I made on Photo-shop to show what I had seen. This is not the original photo of the probe���but is of the location and what the probe looked liked. I���m an aircraft inspector and been around aircraft for forty-two years,Twenty-two in Air Force and Twenty with NASA--still working... I have seen two UFO���S in my life time. One last year in Trinity Bay will I was fishing and one over Arizona in 1974, from a airline.... Both were disk shape. The one I saw over Trinity Bay was a glow- orange moving away from me slow an in seconds it disappeared.. One in Arizona was dancing all over the desert flood and sped off much the same way, both sightings were in day light."],"Longitude":"-95.279617","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/30/0002 12:28 UTC","Object Features":"Window(s)","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.571347,+-95.279617(18519)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18519) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08072009-0003","Case Number":"18519","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Latitude":"29.571347","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
