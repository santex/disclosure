As I came to a three way intersection, maybe about twenty(20) feet from my neighbor's front yard, I looked up at the horizon to see if I could spot any constellations. While I was looking, I saw a large object move rapidly across the sky. It was teardrop shaped, and very bright, almost like the sun except it didn't give off any ambient light. It only took about five to ten seconds to move across the sky. I don't know how fast it was actually travelling, but it was going too fast to be any conventional aircraft of my knowledge, an it certainly did not behave like a flare or firework. I didn't know what the object was at first, but I just shrugged and continued walking to my friend's house, slightly confused and wondering exactly what I had just saw. It was one of the strangest things I'd ever seen."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.634259","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/12/2006 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27850.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27850.html"],"Latitude":"38.487654","Tags":"City"}
