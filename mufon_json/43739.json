At first we thought it was a ghost until we zoomed in, remember at the time the superstorm sandy was raging outside and the window is two stories up with a strait drop. There is no way for anybody to be looking in that window, we don't even have a ladder on the property that can reach that high. I keep my blinds closed at night now. None of the other pictures contain the image and we tried to recreate it many times - I won't be shocked if the men in black show up and confiscate my computer. There Has to be a reason that other pictures of creatures like this have not surfaced. Weirded out."],"trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Woonsocket","There were no other sightings in Woonsocket on or around October 29th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43739.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43739.html"],"Log Number":"US-11062012-0004","Date Submitted":"11/06/2012 11:25 UTC","Longitude":"-71.537925","City":"Woonsocket"}
