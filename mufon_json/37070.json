I couldn't go to sleep, so I stepped outside the side porch for some air. 2. I was just gazing at the stars when I noticed the lit object. 3. When I first noticed it I thought it was a plane in the distant, but when my eyes adjusted to it, I noticed it was huge with multiple lights. 4. It was a V-Shaped UFO with multiple lights under it. It was traveling pretty quickly from a South to North Direction. I was getting excited because it was going to pass pretty close to the moon and I was going to get a better view of its outline. As it got closer the lights quickly dimmed and it vanished. 5. At first I was startled to see something so close, then I got excited about it. 6. It seemed to vanish and there was no more sign of it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37070.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37070.html"],"trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There were no other sightings in Colorado Springs on or around April 2nd 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.838802,+-104.818193(37070)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37070) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"37070","Date Submitted":"04/02/2012 03:32 UTC","Summary":"A V-shaped UFO","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Colorado Springs"}
