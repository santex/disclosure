It was a bright ball yellowish in color and went what looked to be slow but was actually faster then thought. we at first thought is was a plane but as it got closer we noticed it had aboslutly no flases so I thought may be it was not on. I looked harder and saw the light was all overthe object and then I saw the object it self was mostly the light. Then another was about the ufos from prayer. I read online and saw the news about Prophet Yaweah a religious person who prayes for ufos and on the news tape you can see it for your self. So I decided to try it Every one else online on a website said the got two bight flashes and the color was green. I did this and it matched othe claims which was seven and I was the eighth."],"Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere"}
