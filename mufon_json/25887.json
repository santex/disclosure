As I got closer to it and looked up in appeared to be a triangular shaped metalic object just spinning around stationary. It was not a plane or a helicopter thats for sure. I don't know what it was. I thought to myself other people have had to have seen this as well. I looked in the paper this morning, but did not see any mention of this. Maybe people saw it but only told people they knew about it. It was pretty weird."],"Latitude":"40.016146","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25887.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25887.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/14/2010 02:23 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Downingtown","Longitude":"-75.695384"}
