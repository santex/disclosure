{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my way home and looked up at the sky and saw a white thing, which I first thought was a plane, but then I noticed that there were no wings, and that the object was very white or fluorescent. I do not know exactly what altitude it flew, but it seemed to fly quite low. In the midst of cumulus clouds. March speed of the object was probably the same as commercial aircraft. There were no visible logos on the item. I would estimate the size of the object to be as large as commercial aircraft. I looked at the UFO about 10-15 seconds then it flew into the clouds and I lost sight of it."],"Region":"VÃ¤stmanland County","Longitude":"16.544809","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"Kingdom of Sweden","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"SE-05312010-0004","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Chevron, Cylinder","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Vasteras","Summary":"Shining white tube shaped UFO in Sweden","Date Submitted":"05/31/2010 08:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23544.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23544.html"],"Latitude":"59.6099","Case Number":"23544","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Vasteras","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/31/2010 01:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=59.6099,+16.544809(23544)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23544) map </A>"}
