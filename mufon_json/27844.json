i know this sounds unreal, and maybe that's why i've kept our story between the four of us and a few close friends for 2 years, but i swear to you that this next experience has changed all of our lives forever. we cannot explain what we saw. we saw the bright light, and then we saw this giant, black mass coming right at us. i will never know how it traveled from a distance relative to stars to the rooftop so quickly. it was literally seconds. we all kind of screamed, watching the light get closer, but never taking our eyes off of it. it came so close that we thought it would begin to knock over treetops or crash into the house. the object we saw was enormous. it dwarfed the house and the property and was the blackest black, with no details visible except for a few orangish white lights on the bottom. it was shaped like a guitar pick and it seemed as if these dull lights were placed in the corners of the triangle. it was traveling fast and made no sound. it is impossible for something so gigantic to fly. it is even more impossible for it to do so silently. as it flew directly over the house, i ran inside, through the house and out a door on the opposite side to catch the rest of it's descent. i saw the mass, but it was so low that i lost it to the trees as soon as it passed. we were hysterical. my father and i were yelling, excited and scared at the same time, recounting what we has just seen. my boyfriend was quiet, stunned, not sure how to react. my brother solemnly whispered \"holy f*&#, that was the starship enterprise\", not trying to be funny, but in a reflective, shocked manner. we all went over the sequence of events a hundred times that night, and probably hundreds since then. we assumed no one outside the house would take us seriously, so we kept it to ourselves. the family and close friends we did tell gave us pitying looks and offered up explanations like 'planes' and 'search lights.' that is not even close to what we saw. we are all level headed, educated people, and we were the first to try and debunk what we were seeing, but we could not. this experience has changed our lives, and i think that we are finally ready for real answers and real input. was the strange sound\\shaking of the house related to what we saw? why did it come so close to us? where did it go? did it land? how could it have been so big? what was it?? it has taken me a year and a half to share my story, but i have thought about this every day. i live not even 2 miles from where this sighting took place, and have since witnessed other ufo activity which i would happily share with anyone who is interested or willing to offer answers, but what happened on that night is the most haunting experience of my life. i need to know what we saw."],"Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like, Triangle, Other","Region":"Pennsylvania","Longitude":"-76.787925","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27844.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27844.html"],"Summary":"4 Witnesses-strange moving light in sky turned into close encounter","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.897032,+-76.787925(27844)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27844) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"40.897032"}
