{"Date of the Event":"02/20/2008 10:20 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs I was watching the Lunar Eclipse from my back Yard, I decided to try and record the event. I took photos of the Moon with a Digital Camera but I thought I wouldn't even be able to see the Moon in the photos. I decided to try and record with my Sony 990X Video camera. The Eclipse was Very Visible through the view finder. I placed my Camera on a Tripod and started Recording. I don't know the exact time as I don't wear a watch but it had to be around 10PM Eastern Time, give or take 20 minutes I saw what I thought at first was a Falling Star. Later as I plugged the Video into my TV, I was stuned to see an object come from the Top Right Corner to the Bottom Left Corner with Amazing Speed and Flashing White Lights. Check out the video and make your own decisions. I feel sure others had to see this UFO also."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Case Number":"9661","Summary":"Object came from Above Right of the Lunar Eclipse to Lower Left With Flashing lights","Log Number":"US-02212008-0004","Date Submitted":"02/20/2008 10:20 UTC","Region":"South Carolina","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Anderson","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-82.648533","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9661.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9661.html"],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Anderson","There were no other sightings in Anderson on or around February 20th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.507839","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar, Cross, Flash, Saturn-like, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.507839,+-82.648533(9661)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9661) map </A>"}
