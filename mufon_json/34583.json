I went outside. I at first thought they were planes landing at D.I.A. however the did not move and were not blinking. More showed up and were also stationary. Some vanished and then they made a v formation. Then they made a line going from the ground up. My friendly.d and I attempted to drive closer but by the time we got to a in-lit area they were all gone. They were right above the airport where the airplanes take off. So we knew they were not planes waiting to land. And while they were their no planes were leaving or landing. It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life I was so excited I could hardly breath. My thoughts were going a million miles a second it was intense."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/29/2011 08:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34583.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34583.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","trends":[""],"Country":"United States","Summary":"lights that appeared and dissapeared making a v formation and then a strait line. smaller dimer ones apeared and vanishid.","Log Number":"US-01042012-0004","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown"}
