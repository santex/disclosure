And there again I witnessed more strange lights. This was like a falling star I thought, except when I looked it was a ball of light that was descending down towards my window very low and it had a trail following after. It squirmed down towards my window like an eel in the air. It lasted only a few seconds and once again I am shocked and getting sort of worried. A few weeks before my daughter woke me up and said there was a buzzing noise over her bed like a wirily bird I went in and she could still here it but fading away but I never hear it. Lots of strange things here by LAX!"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31933.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31933.html"]}
