{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home one night (at about 2AM) in January, 1974, southbound on the 405 Fwy on the Sepulveda Pass as it approaches the Westwood area. It was a clear night, and I noticed a light hovering in the sky over Westwood. I thought it odd that a helicopter (which I believed it was) would be up so high, and at this hour. I watched it for a minute or so, and then, it shot across the sky toward the downtown LA area. It took only 1-2 seconds to travel the approximately 15 mile distance and then hovered over the downtown LA area. I was amazed at how quickly it traveled that distance, and knew it couldn't be a helicopter. After about 10 seconds, the light went straight up and disappeared into the sky. At that point, I was certain that I had seen a UFO."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Latitude":"34.00009","Date of the Event":"12/31/1973 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Culver City","There were no other sightings in Culver City on or around December 31st 1973"],"Summary":"A hovering light that traveled over LA in a split second, then shot straight up.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16464.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16464.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.00009,+-118.427984(16464)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16464) map </A>","City":"Culver City","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-118.427984","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-04102009-0002","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/31/1973 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"16464","Region":"California"}
