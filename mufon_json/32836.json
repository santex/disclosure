{"Log Number":"US-10242011-0020","divs":["sighting detailsgreen red and blue flashing lights usually in the shape of a triangle. they like to hover over our pasture above the horses. the horses don't seem to mind them, however my children like to look at them altogether but will not try to observe them alone. we hear a very distinct humming when they are near and they sometimes seem to jam the cell phone for pictures. the most resent was up the street from our house and hovered for a while and then shot staight up in the sky and disapeared. i saw this while driving and turned around to get a better view but it was already gone. my son was screaming for me to take him home he did not want to be anywhere near the object. back in january i was laying down ready for bed when one shot a light into our house and continued the beam for about 2 hours into my eyes. i was trying to sleep, after getting tired of the light i moved to get out of the light. the light moved with me and continued to shine in my face. my husband saw this and blamed it on the moon but what i want to know is how can the moon stay in one spot for 2-2 1\\2 hours and only move once i did. my son and i looked out of the front door to see where the light was coming from and it was just in front of our house right above the trees. i was very scared and unable to sleep for a very long time. now we have seen them so many times that we no longer are afraid. but we dont want to be alone outside at night!"],"City":"richmond","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in richmond","There was one other sighting in richmond on or around October 22nd 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32836.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32836.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.373804,+-78.146029(32836)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32836) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"several we see them very frequently","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-78.146029","Date of the Event":"10/22/2011 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"32836","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.373804","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Virginia","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Sphere, Triangle","Date Submitted":"10/24/2011 07:58 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
