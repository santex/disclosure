Good evening, I would like to tell about my extraterrestrial experience in brief words: One night, when I was sleeping, a \"machine\" settled on the right side of my head and almost hypnotized me to insert a device through my right ear. I called this artifact the \"mini-machine in my brain.\" Since then, I have suffered uncountable bad experiences because the \"mini-machine in my brain\" controls all my body from my brain. Definitely, it is not about an illness of the mind or of the nervous system, but about a phenomenon that I can not explain since I do not remember seen an UFO. Probably, now, instead of coming inside UFOs, the extraterrestrials send mini-robots to accomplish their missions. Why have I been captured? What should I do to get back my freedom? Are there any other cases like mine's? If you need more information about it I can provide it. Thank you very much for your interest and best regards, Luis Villegas. spvh_hvps@hotmail.com"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"Mexico","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-102.552784","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6599.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6599.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"23.634501","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Summary":"Abduction with mini-machine implant on my brain.","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in México","There were no other sightings in México on or around March 1st 2003"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/01/2003 11:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/01/2003 11:00 UTC","Region":"","Case Number":"6599","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
