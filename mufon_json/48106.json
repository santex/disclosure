My son asked me \"what is that \"? I said I don't know but it is coming right at us. We both witnessed a sparkling sphere traveling from the North going due South. I can best describe the sphere as omitting multi colors as would a sparkler used by small children on the 4th. We watched the sphere stop and shoot straight up to the heavens. The speed resembled the reverse of a shooting star. I'm not an expert on aviation, but I am a retired engineer. I do understand G-Force. No living thing of this earth could withstand that type of force. My son was really upset at what he had seen. I was lucky enough to see a saucer type UFO in the sixties. I was aware of the existence."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Winchester","There were no other sightings in Winchester on or around July 4th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Winchester","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Region":"Indiana","Longitude":"-84.971995","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None"}
