(and maybe that is still true for some) but in this case, you would have to have something significantly powerful that could focus in on it. like you would be trying to focus in on a plane that high up and be able to show you some specifics (like how many windows are on it that far up)...so you can see how hard this would be. unfortunately, as this is my first experience it took me a minute to finally think about pulling over and doing a poor attempt at getting a picture with my cell phone. so, now photos or anything. but i am really considering bringing my recorder even though i probably won't be able to get much if it's that far up again. for sure, this was not a plane or a weather balloon or any of that nonsense. anyway, my first ufo sighting (i'm 33 and somewhat of a skeptic). hoping for more now..."],"Longitude":"-92.436371","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/03/2009 07:13 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-08052011-0068","Latitude":"35.090496","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arkansas","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Egg","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Conway","There were no other sightings in Conway on or around December 3rd 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20861.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/05/2011 04:43 UTC","Tags":"City"}
