It takes less than a second to shoot a bracketing of 3 photos. When I got home to process them, I noticed on one of the three bracketed photos was something to the right of this stone arch i was shooting. I was angled up towards the sky with my canon 7D camera. The craft is only on one of the three photos, I was also using a tripod. I didnt notice anything while shooting the pictures, no sound, nothing to grab my attention. I only noticed when I got home and started processing my photos."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Date of the Event":"05/24/2011 02:18 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29232.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29232_submitter_file1__IMG_2017.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29232.html"]}
