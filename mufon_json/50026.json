(Quality Inn & Suites, 3301 Atlantic Ave., Ocean City MD 21842, Phone: 410-289-1234, FAX: 410-289-0123) His wife and children were asleep inside the suite and the lights were out, except for a night light. The witness��� position was: N 38* 21.697��� W 75* 04.263��� Elevation: 20���. The night was clear with a minor degree of light diffusion from nearby hotels. The moon had not yet risen and would not for several hours hence. Above the horizon, due east, were occasional flashes of light, emmited by a thunderstorm occurring beyond the curvature. Several meteor streaks were observed by the witness as well as a number of commercial aircraft at standard cruising levels, before the sighting. At approximately 10:00 - 10:15 PM the witness noticed a small orange light to the north that appeared to be quite low over the ocean surface at approximately 100 ��� 300 feet in altitude, moving in a southerly heading toward the witness at a rather rapid rate of speed. Within approximately 10 seconds, the light had reached the size of a full moon and was very bright ��� the brightness and color approximated the coloring and intensity of a setting sun. The witness had binoculars and focused them on the light. With the magnification, the object appeared to be a glowing orange sphere with uniform color and brightness. The color was soft and muted and emanated from the interior of the sphere. The sphere was pleasant and soothing to the eye. There were no other lights or visible characteristics appearing on the sphere. The sphere was approximately 5 ��� 10 miles, north, of the witness when it reached its maximum size and it remained several hundred feet above the ocean surface. At this point, the sphere began moving in an easterly direction, directly out to sea, and it diminished in size due to its increasing distance from the witness. It continued on its easterly course for approximately 10 ��� 15 seconds until its size appeared to be that of a very large star. At this point, the sphere commenced a straight climb of approximately 45* on a southerly heading. The climb was rapid and it leveled off at approximately 10,000 feet. It then continued straight and level on its southerly heading. The angle of inclination of the sphere, at this point, was estimated at approximately 30*. The sphere continued on its southerly, level course for approximately 10 seconds then turned to a south-easterly heading, in the general direction of the the thunderstorm, and continued on this course until it was no longer visible due to the increased distance from witness. The witness continued to watch the sky for approximately 10 minutes thereafter. Then, assuming the sighting had come to an end, he entered the suite and proceeded to the kitchen where he filled a bowl with caramel popcorn and returned to the balcony. The witness was absent from the balcony for approximately 5 minutes in procuring his snack. He resumed watching the sky for any further activity. After about 10 minutes, the witness noticed a second sphere in the same azimuth as he had initially seen the first sphere. his second sphere was identical to the first sphere in every respect. It proceeded to follow the same maneuvers as did the first sphere at the same speed and altitudes. It proceeded to the final south-easterly course and, like the first sphere, was no longer visible, after a short time, due to the increased distance from the witness. Approximately ten minutes after the second sphere's disappearance, a third sphere, identical to the first two, appeared in the same azimuth as the first two spheres and repeated the same course maneuvers, identical to the first two spheres. This process continued, until a total of eight identical spheres observed. The sighting came to an end after the eighth sphere. The elapsed time from beginning to end of the sighting was approximately 60 to 90 minutes. All the spheres were silent throughout their manuevers and their speed remained constant. All legs of the course were flown in a straight flight pattern, with no irregular movements, and at a constant velocity. The only aspect of their maneuvering that was anomalous was that their course changes appeared to be angular in nature, while normal aircraft require a curved course to change heading because of their dependence on air pressure differentials to accomplish flight and directional control. Although the flight, velocity and climb characteristics of the spheres were unremarkable, as a former military pilot, the witness had never observed any aircraft of this appearance in the sky and had never witnessed any craft, at this close range, under precise directional control, do so in total silence. These aspects of the sighting were, to the witness, totally anomalous to his experience. As a former military pilot, the witness ruled out the possibility of these objects being baloons, due to their precise, controlled maneuvering and their velocity and climb characteristics. He also ruled out the possibility of their being blimps, due to their speed and maneuvering characteristics and, also, their physical appearance."],"Summary":"Witnessed 8 identical, glowing, full moon size,orange spheres, one sphere at a tme which first appeared in the same azimuth and performed the same course manuevers at the same velocity.","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Ocean City","There were no other sightings in Ocean City on or around July 29th 2013"],"Region":"Maryland","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50026.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50026.html"],"Log Number":"US-08202013-0010","Latitude":"38.382202","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
