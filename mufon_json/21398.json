was walking the dogs one night in lincoln lincolnshire at about 20:00. i used to live on tudor road, which backed onto hartsholm country park below. harts park, lincoln. around 3 miles from lincoln city centre is hartsholm country park in lincolnshire uk. i used to have an open mind about ufo`s in those days as i thought that we the human race must be very arrogant as to believe that we are the only living thing in the universe with intelligence. confirmation that intelligence does exist elsewhere in the universe was proved to me that night 02\\01\\2000. routinely i would walk the dogs every night up a path which leads from birchwood avenue to the edge of hartsholm country park, the path ran around the back of my house in tudor road. the night started off as a normal every day night until whilst walking up the winding path i stopped and let the dogs off the lead, this was as we were reaching the end of the path which leads into the park, it was common practice for me to let the dogs run into the woods to do their business while i waited for them at the end of the path, there is a street lamp there and on this occasion the filament was red instead of orange. while i waited not thinking about anything in particular i experienced a severe pain in my temporal lobe, it felt like the worst migraine that i have ever experienced before, i put my hand up to my head and i felt compelled to look up as if the pain was coming from a direction, and when i looked up i could not believe what i was looking at, i saw a huge bright white light, and it was blinding to look at, it was the brightest whitest light that i have ever seen, i was ridged to the spot in shock, and i felt like my mind was being read, i remember feeling very angry because without my permission all that was in my mind was stolen, mind raped is the best description that i can give. i began to fight back mentally and i cursed it with every thing that i could from god and jesus through to mary, then all of a sudden it just shot straight up at an indescribable speed and became a star, you remember the old black and white televisions when you turned them off the picture would reduce to a tiny dot, well that is as close to the speed that i can get. i stood there still ridged to the spot when my dogs suddenly appeared, i did not even hang around to put the leads on them and i ran home as fast as i could, the dogs thankfully arrived with me unharmed, i ran because i was afraid that it would come back and get me. i told my partner at the time and we agreed that we should keep it to ourselves. the following day at around 15:00 in broad daylight, i decided that my partner and i would have fish and chips for tea, so i took a walk with my german sheppard dog down to the chippy, which was at a shopping precinct called the forum just off birchwood avenue, when halfway to the chippy i felt that compulsion again to look up and there through a gap in the clouds was this huge black triangular craft with lights very dimly lit, the lights where fuzzy and distorted to look at as the clouds passed under the strange craft, the colours omitted was red and green, i watched in shock as cars went down the road and the drivers not knowing what was hovering above them, school children walked the pavement on the other side of the road blissfully unaware. i didn���t raise the alarm, i don���t know why but i just watched, then another thick cloud passed underneath it, then another gap appeared and there was nothing to be seen, it had completely vanished. i hatefully got to the fish and chip shop, said nothing to the staff apart from ordering my meals and got home as fast as i could. on arriving home i told my partner and she was surprised but very understanding, we talked all night and agreed what we had before, to keep it to ourselves. two weeks later we had a neighbour come over for dinner, and as the night progressed the wine flowed and bill my neighbour who worked for boeing aircraft manufacturers on their breaking systems at waddington airbase, i told him myself what i had seen. he listened intently and said, \"you should have mentioned it before as i believe someone else reported seeing a ufo to the lincolnshire echo\". i still have not seen the report that���s if it exists at all, and it would be great if it does then it would confirm my sighting. the houses in area that i lived in called doddington park are mainly occupied by raf pilots and personnel, i wonder if that has any bearing to my sighting, i myself am not connected to the raf, i am just an ordinary civilian. yours truthfully ash"],"Latitude":"40.813492","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21398.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21398.html"],"trends":["There have been 42 other
