I came out and saw what looked like red flashing stars flying over the building. I pulled out my phone and began to record. Some of the objects seemed to be flying to close together to be planes and they were flying slow. I immediately thought it had to be military planes because I knew it was not regular planes. I recorded 7 objects flying but there were more before I began recording.They sort of just disappeared into the night."],"Case Number":"36724","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36724.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36724.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Georgia","Log Number":"US-03252012-0011","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"32.162585","Longitude":"-82.905123","Date Submitted":"03/25/2012 11:13 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/24/2012 09:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.162585,+-82.905123(36724)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36724) map </A>"}
