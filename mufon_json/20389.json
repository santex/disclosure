When I first looked up I saw what I first thought to be a \"shooting star\" with this massive aircraft circling the airspace where the shooting star was descending at. The strange light in the southern sky that at first appeared to resemble one single shooting star with a small tail on it entering the earth���s atmosphere. Then I noticed the object start slowing its descent, then the object \"deployed\" I watched as the light split into four separate lights each with their own small tail on them, that began to perform their own flight maneuvers. I pulled over to the side of the road near Westlake Parkway, from that advantage point it appeared that the first light I saw had stopped descending and was hovering as the three other objects descended in a spiraling pattern. At this time I also saw \"Other Lights\" suddenly pop on around the first light that was appearing to be stationary in the sky. At one point I counted up to six of these strange yellowish lights in the sky. The entire time there was a strange military craft circling the area. I picked up my Iphone to try and make a call but I the phone had no signal (Very Odd!) I drove down the road to Trophy Lake Dr. and pulled into the shopping center parking lot where I was able to make a phone call. I got out of my car and could still see some of the lights but was not in a very good vantage point. However I was able to get a better look at the strange military craft, it flew directly over the Blockbuster Parking lot I was at. As it flew maybe 2000-3000 feet over my head I could make out the sounds of four big prop driven engines. I did not see any maker���s or insignia���s on the aircraft, however, this massive aircraft also had four big lights on it (two on each wing), that made the aircraft very easy to spot in the sky as it held its very tight bank around these strange lights. This sighting lasted maybe five minutes afterwards I returned to my trip home."],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-97.195014","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20389.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20389.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/08/2009 10:46 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.991235,+-97.195014(20389)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20389) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","City":"Westlake","Date of the Event":"11/06/2009 07:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
