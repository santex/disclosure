They were all really easy to see and closer than they should be to the earth... (probably going to Toledo Airport or something).. And that's when it caught my eye... it was this pulsating white light in the shape of a crescent mood but turned like a smile and the object seemed like it was reflective... it pulsated to a neon red-orange light and back to white.. then the brightness grew and then it completely disappeared leaving no trace. I felt like the how feel of the atmosphere changed and I felt a extreme sense of vulnerability but it might have been just my reaction to what I saw... I am not one to really get nervous about this kind of stuff so it was weird that I was feeling that way... also felt like my equilibrium was off."],"Latitude":"41.380584","Country":"United States"}
