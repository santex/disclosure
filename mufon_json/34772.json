It was heading my way which was north, going a little fast a few seconds later it went really fast and turned around and headed south, it went faster then, and became almost completely invisible 3 times I watched it as it kept going for a few minutes and then it disappeared. There was no noise at all either. When I first seen it I knew it was a U.F.O. And I was excited because I've always wanted to see one and I finally got to."]}
