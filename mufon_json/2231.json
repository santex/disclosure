Ilive in Fort Worth Texas. This was around 1038 am.My husband was in the passenger seat, my three children were in the back.My son cuts their lawn on Sundays. I was traveling north and saw two objectsstrait ahead up in the sky, one was clearly a passenger jet, the other appearedsimply to be a ball, a sphere. It was behind a fair distance and above thepassenger jet. I began to slow down, cause I was very curious as to what thiswas. I kept my eye on it, and pointed it out to my husband, who glimpsed it.I looked down for a second to steer the car, and looked back up and it was GONE.The airline jet was traveling on its way, but the shiny sphere was just gone. Iwas able to observe it for at least 10 seconds.It just couldnt have been any aircraft we are aware of.. it was just so simplyand firmly what I saw.. a shiny sphere. Would like to know if any one else hadseen anything in the same areastate as I did on that dayThanks,Sandra Vargas"]}
