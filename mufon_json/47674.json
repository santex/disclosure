I only filmed for a minute because my batteries were weak. After loading the video in my computer, I watched closely. At 21-22 seconds there appeared to be an object at 0900 direction, similar to a stealth fighter. There is also a possible shock wave noise just before the craft flew by. I've attached the video. Turn up the volume to listen to the noise and observe the object at 21-22 seconds. It's gone in a millisecond."],"Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-05272013-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47674.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47674.html"],"Region":"Mississippi","Summary":"Set up video camera towards the NE on a tripod.
