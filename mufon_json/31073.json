Two white objects appeared and are seen at high altitude (30,000ft or higher) making a vapor trail traveling from west to east that did not dissipate quickly. Tracked at 37x zoom seeing two distinct, separate white objects. First thought that the objects were a commercial aircraft making a strange vapor trail due to the weather conditions. The two objects were different in size (smaller leading with larger following) with both being rectangular in shape, totally white with black dots along all four edges traveling at normal commercial aircraft speeds and appearance from the ground without the digital camera. The objects disappeared when tracking became too far away to see anything but the vapor trail in the eastern sky. Duration approx. 1 min."],"Disposition":"IFO"}
