I stopped to take a look at the sky and I noticed the object sailing across the sky. First of all, it was moving VERY fast. It was spherical and giving off a fixed red glow. There were no flashing lights or noises. The object smoothly sailed off. I lost sight of the object when it went beyond the horizon."],"trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Norfolk","There were no other sightings in Norfolk on or around October 21st 2008"],"Region":"Virginia","Latitude":"36.851909","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/21/2008 07:57 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-76.284813","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/21/2008 07:57 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"13146","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10212008-0018","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
