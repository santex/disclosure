{"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Kittitas","Region":"Washington","divs":["sighting detailsit was the day before opening deer season. i had brought a girl along with my family because had never went camping. we were outside waiting for the camp fire to go out. my girlfriend said \"what the hell is that?\" i looked up and said it's probably an airplane. she said no it's not. i grabbed a a pair of binocaluers and walked toward the direction of the light. i scoped in on it. it was an sphere of orange light with a red light rotating around the middle of it. (there was also a near full moon seeing was not a problem) the red light made three rotations, on the third rotation it split into two seprate lights, same size. i asked my gf did you see that? airplanes don't do that. she started freaking tell me to come back into camp. i got closer to her to make her feel better. then we saw it. a third light literally came out of thin air. you saw a twinkle of white light then bam it would turn into an orange sphere. they flew in purposeful patterns, then disappeared behind some hills. i went into our trailer and had my husband come out. maybe two minutes went by and two of them came back, twinkle then bam. my husband told us not to be too loud he did not want the kids to worry. he went back insidew\\kids. i grabbed a flashlight. my gf asked me what i was doing. i told her i was going to see if they would communicate. she freaked no don't do that. i did it anyway. two more showed up after i started flashing the light. we went back inside the trailer. the next night i, with my oldest daughter took my gf home. eight fourtyfive we headed back up the pass towards ellensburg. my daughter said mom are those the lights you and marina were talking about. they were back. they showed up again the next night. then nothing til several days later. we were at my girlfriends house in yakima visiting on the 22nd. we were on her front porch. it was 6:30ish. i looked up and saw the damn light again. i looked at my girlfriend and she said \"you see it too?\" i told her \"is this thing following us?\" she said \"your the fool who tried to talk to them.\" i haven't seen them since. i am thinking it's point of origin was around the yakima firing range (military base). my gf said military aircraft doesn't split in half, i agree. i believe they are not of this earth."],"Date of the Event":"10/10/2008 09:45 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"46.983182","Date Submitted":"10/10/2008 09:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"14509","Longitude":"-120.41701","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.983182,+-120.41701(14509)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14509) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14509.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14509.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Kittitas","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Ball of orange light w/red light circling in the middle.","Log Number":"US-12232008-0013","Tags":"City"}
