I looked across the field and observed 3 bright light low in the sky NW of where I stood. Luckily I had a camera in my truck and ran to get it. I then filmed 3.30 minutes of the objects hovering. They were in a triangle shape and move together so I thought it was a single craft until the one to the farthest right made a path to the north and disappeared. Then the one to the left did the same. Eventually the one left also did the same. I watch the sky often and have never seen aircraft in this area like this before. I walked back inside to look at the video and heard a couple jets fly over. Now it is pretty silent. Oh, also, while I was outside the neighbors horses were acting very strange."],"City":"Gilroy","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47716.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47716.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"37.014342","Log Number":"US-05292013-0001","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Gilroy","There were no other sightings in Gilroy on or around May 28th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.014342,+-121.566975(47716)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47716) map </A>"}
