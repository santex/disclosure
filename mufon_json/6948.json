{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is a MUFON - Wisconsin case. The Witness and her husband were returning to Wisconsin from Florida aboard a Midwest Airliners flight when she saw a pair of white lights out the right side window of the aircraft. The was one small and seemed far away and the other was very bright and large and was very close to the aircraft. After watching the lights for a few minutes, the small light disappeared. A few minutes later, the nearby large light switched off. After about ten minutes, the witness observed another very bright star-like light which began to maneuver and change position. After repeating the maneuvering for several minutes, the light returned to its original position in the sky and resumed looking like a huge star. The witness lost sight of the light as the aircraft began it's approach to land at Milwaukee's General Billy Mitchell Field."],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"43.040192","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6948.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6948.html"],"Case Number":"6948","Longitude":"-87.898474","Date Submitted":"06/30/2001 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"06/30/2001 12:00 UTC","City":"Milwaukee","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Large White Light Close To Airliner","Sighting Duration":"00:25:00","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Milwaukee","There were no other sightings in Milwaukee on or around June 30th 2001"],"Region":"Wisconsin","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.040192,+-87.898474(6948)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6948) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-05012007-0011"}
