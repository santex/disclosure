I noticed a light out of the corner of my eye. When I turned to look out of the window which faces due west I noticed a light that started as quite dim then brightened almost like an airplane landing light then gradually disappear. It was approximately 3 times the height of the mountains which are about 70 miles away. At first I assumed that it was an airplane but it did not move. I went outside and watched for approximately another 5 minutes but it did not return. There were no airplanes or stars in the vicinity. Total time was approximately 8 - 10 seconds."],"City":"Grants Pass","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"7793","Summary":"Very bright stationary light.","Longitude":"-123.319472","Log Number":"US-08312007-0002","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"08/30/2007 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"42.445827"}
