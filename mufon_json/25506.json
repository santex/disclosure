They over a mountain called Doublehead, near Black Mountain in Jackson, N.H. Every once in a while the larger one would send a beam of red light to the smaller one and the smaller one would then return a beam of red light! They stayed in one spot while this was happening. Don't know how long this lasted...seemed like a very long time. Fear made me go back into house. About a year ago the sky in the same location was completly lit up with the same kind of action. The night skies are very active in this area every August, September and October!"],"Region":"New Hampshire","Log Number":"US-09202010-0004","Latitude":"44.146261","Longitude":"-71.1851","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25506.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25506.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Oval","Date of the Event":"09/18/2010 09:15 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Jackson","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"25506","City":"Jackson","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
