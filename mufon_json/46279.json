(there were at least 300 people at the event) i had just purchased a new cell phone a few days before and had not yet learned how to use the video recording feature, so i learned \"on the fly\". the resulting video is attached. for the first few minutes, i could not get the video recording feature working, so there are some minutes where we observed the object for which there was no video. i also attached two maps, one a closer up view, and one further out. the blue dot in both maps is our position. the red dot in the second map is the perceived position of the actual object. this is only an estimate, as it was not possible to accurately determine how far away the object was. the coordinates where we were att were 45,863746 \\ -122.405199, according to itouchmap.com (this is the blue dot in the attached maps) note that i am an active mufon field investigator for oregon. i would have reported this case earlier, but my sim card on the phone died, so i thought i lost the video. i just recently discovered that i had a backup of the sim card contents that i had made before the sim card died, so i decided to submit the case."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46279.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46279.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 09:55 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Washington","Latitude":"45.869938","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.869938,+-122.410424(46279)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46279) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03182013-0016","City":"Yacolt","Longitude":"-122.410424"}
