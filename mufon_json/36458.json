His flight was late, arriving at 12:15 am. We were driving home going north (west) on I 10 at about 12:30 am. We were adjacent to city center when we both saw a bright glowing green equilateral triangle descending very fast in front of us, over a mile away (a guess) but in front of the Tortalitas. At about 45 degrees from the horizon, it gave off \"sparks,\" or small balls of light from the triangle point on the bottom left ( it was descending with the triangle pointing up). As it neared the horizon it winked out. it was a very quick sighting. We both saw it and compared notes."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Tucson"}
