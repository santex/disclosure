{"Date of the Event":"01/29/2009 07:20 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son(13yrs) and husband(33yrs)saw a fast moving orange star like object move across the sky last night while sitting in our hot tub star gazing. I believe from thier description it was going from northwest to south. They have seen satelights before, but my husband said this was not a satelight. I'm reporting this on their behalf. I did not see it last night, but last summer we saw a bunch of them. I have reported most of our sightings. My son always yells to me from our back door to tell me that there is another ufo that they can see. We have a very large obstructed view of the sky, so I think that's what helps us see so many."],"City":"West Jordan","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in West Jordan","There were no other sightings in West Jordan on or around January 29th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/29/2009 07:20 UTC","Longitude":"-111.936643","Latitude":"40.6119","Case Number":"15206","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01302009-0011","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.6119,+-111.936643(15206)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15206) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Saw fast moving orange star move across the sky","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15206.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15206.html"],"Region":"Utah","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
