Approximately betweeen 5 and 8 pm California time. It was still full daylight. Family members and I were outside when we saw 7 unidentifiable round objects come down out of the sky, one at a time. They were whitish in color. They were not close, but close enough to see. We watched for I would say at least 10 minutes. Then one by one, they retreated back into the atmosphere. What we saw were not planes, blimps, or balloons. We believed them to be UFO's and watched them in awe until they disappeared. Given the fact that this occurred on July 4, like many other sightings, reinforced the belief that these might have been alien craft. I am wondering if anyone else witnessed this event over Los Angeles, CA on that day and time."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20429.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20429.html"]}
