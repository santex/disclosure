The object was moving at 323 degrees NW. The object then dimmed to no light at all then re-appeared moving 0 degrees N. Second object was similar in nature but moved from the 323 degrees NW to a 70 degree NE route. While writing this observation another object did the exact same thing. Shined bright then dimmed to nothing then came back very bright again. Moving in the NW route. Approximate time 11:05 PM PST. I used my satellite app and it showed no potential objects in that direction. There was also an airplane that left San Jose International Airport heading approx 60 degrees NE at the same time of seeing the third object."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.907442,+-121.315721(48846)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48846) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown"}
