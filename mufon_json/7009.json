I was lucky enough to have captured what I think is NOT a conventional flying object! I have learned not to just 'save' the picture as the 'saved' picture refreshes when the webcam does, so I use 'Print Screen' instead so the saved pic remains the same. I have a few pics and I have one that is huge in size so you'll see it much bigger. I can't say for sure, but it looks like it may be a cylinder because of the 'flatness' of it. In any event I think I am lucky to have captured this image."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7009.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7009_submitter_file1__HZ1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7009_submitter_file2__HZenlarged.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7009_submitter_file3__HZ3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7009.html"]}
