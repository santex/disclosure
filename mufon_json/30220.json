I went out to check the mail when i got home. As i started to go down the drive way, notice some orange to red dots pretty low, qt first i thought they were just helicopters. As i watched for a moment, i then thought maybe they were some type off fireworks, at that moment they started to turn at a certain point. It wasnt all at once, so it couldnt be the wind. At that point i called my mother to tell her to come out right now! Shes not the type to curse regularly but when she saw what i seen she said \"what the #$%& is that!\" The whole ordeal only lasted about 5mins. Unfortunatly i was not able to get a pic or video as i only had my phone and the street light was too bright to get anything else."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/16/2011 11:39 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.997272","Case Number":"30220","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/16/2011 09:30 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"11 ufos in winfield mo","City":"Winfield"}
