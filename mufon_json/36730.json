Then i immediately turned around and saw it, at first it was just one multi-color changing orb, then another appeared out of no where right next it; and then a third one on top of both of them. they all changed color very quickly, and had a fire looking kind of touch to it. Eventually two of them faded a little bit, and moved away from each other while the one on top of them elevated even higher and in the sky and stayed there. 10 minutes later the other two came back. and at a flash I saw two blue lights right next to the two orbs that had just came back, these blue ones were very quick. they were gone in a blink. I was very amused because I enjoy these kinds of things, they're mysterious."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Longitude":"-117.884663","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.771949,+-117.884663(36730)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36730) map </A>","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36730.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36730.html"],"Log Number":"US-03252012-0017"}
