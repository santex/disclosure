Dark in color a little lighter toward the bottom of it. The \"object\" reminded me of an very large X-Ray in the sky. The object was just floating in one place, it looked almost like it was \"transparent\" in some way, it looked like I was viewing from an reflection from an swimming pool, (if that make sense) Another odd thing was, I drove around trying to get a better view of it but for some reason I was not able to. It should have been visible from a few other advantage points but it was not! (Weird) I first thought maybe it just floated away until I headed back to my home (same route I first noticed it) and there it was again floating in the exact same spot!! (??) I took off (twice) to see if I could get closer to it and I could only view from one paticular view point. (taking left-hand turn into my subdivision) Very Strange! I noticed it around 3:40 p.m. and I got home around 4:03 p.m. (Judge Judy had been on only a few minutes)!
