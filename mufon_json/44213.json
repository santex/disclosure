It appeared this fireball fell to the earth but may have just travelled out of the horizon and my view. But it appeared to me that the thing was falling as it streaked accross the sky. I originally thought it was a helicopter that had caught fire and was crashing to the ground. Due to its west to east travel and downward descent, I soon realized this wasnt the case."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11282012-0023","Source":"MUFON"}
