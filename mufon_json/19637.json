Dripped into another star shape. Now 2 equal sized stars. bottom one moved above other and then lower star gradually faded and moved away. then top one faded","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs I was looking out my southern window about 6:35 am, I saw a HUGE bright star. I realized it was too big to be a star and I thought it might be a reflection from something in the house so I went outside and it was definitely a bright light low in altitude. It was light out and no other stars were visible. I went back inside to call my brother who lives 6 miles east and noted the time was 6:40. I went back outside and it appeared to be molten when it \"dripped\" down and formed another star of equal size. Now there are two. The bottom one moved slowly to be above the other. The bottom one which seemed to be the original star then faded slowly and moved away to the south. The top one then did the same."]}
