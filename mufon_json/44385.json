The odd thing that my wife noticed first was that there was a strange lightning storm to the east approximately 10 to 15 miles away. It looked like a cloudy Jellyfish. The lighting continued for several minutes. (50+ minutes���) I grabbed my camera and drove to the edge of the Indian River for a better look. I took several pictures on 12 megapixel Kodak camera set for low light. I was trying to capture the Lightning. It was not until I returned home to review the pictures that I realized what I captured. I thought initially that is was star or a pixel artifact. I rapidly changed my mind when I noticed that it (The pixilation spot) continued across three separate pictures. Upon zooming I could see clearly that it was a craft. This is for real. I am not a hoaxer. See attached pictures."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Indian River","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Other","Latitude":"27.694773","Longitude":"-80.543845","City":"Indian River","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/07/2012 10:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44385.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44385.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/06/2012 10:10 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
