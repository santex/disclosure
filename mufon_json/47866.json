I was sitting in the front passenger seat and snapped a photo, with my cell phone, out the car window, looking south. Later when I had arrived to where I was headed I went to upload the photo and noticed a glowing white object next to the moon. I thought it was strange because there were clouds in front of the object. I was hoping that you could help me identify what it is and let me know. Thank you for your time."],"Summary":"Taking picture of the full moon looking south","Date Submitted":"06/04/2013 04:39 UTC"}
