I could not see anything that may of been wing lights. the objects shape and real size is unknown because it was around 1 am and all I seen was the lights moving. what was also strange was the speed of the object. it seemed to be flying way faster than the planes going to and from DIA. I was heading west on I-70 after work and it was heading north around 3 or 4 miles away and about 1 mile above the ground.it seemed to be traveling about 4 or 5 times faster and was about 4 times longer than jets I see near the airport. I lost sight of the object as it flew too far north."],"Date Submitted":"09/19/2013 09:55 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-104.983268","City":"Denver"}
