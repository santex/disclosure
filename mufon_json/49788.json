Out of the corner of my eye I saw two lights, behind trees in the distance. I went to look more as the trees were in the way and I saw a third reddish-orange light like the other two. It slowly moved by and I told the others...Two or three came to look and saw the lights as well and then it suddenly vanished. We all agreed it was nothing like we have ever seen in our lives. It was a really large Isosceles Triangle...no craft seen, just the three lights. All were moving at the same speed none moved away from the other, then it vanished."],"Region":"Ontario"}
