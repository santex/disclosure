{"Longitude":"-77.686109","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy boyfriend and I went to a trip to Penns Cave, Centre Hall, PA to take a tour to see a cave and the wildlife tour. While in the wildlife tour, we saw what looked like a rainbow so we took a picture. When I got home, I placed the chip in my printer and printed some pictures. One of the picture has an orange ball in front of the tall trees. At first I thought it was the sun. But the sun could not be in front of the trees and so close. There is an emission of colorful rays about 42 rays very beutiful. below the orange ball, there are some colors hot pink, aqua blue, light yellow. I think those colors are what is emitting the rays. I want to get the picture copyright before I mail or sent it by email to you. In another incident, my boyfriend and his neighbor were jogging in our neighborhood and they say a light ball fly above them very fast and low in the sky. It was at 5:00 a.m. in the morning early December,2010."],"Log Number":"US-12302010-0007","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/31/2010 12:00 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Summary":"Picture of Orange Ball with colorful rays","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.847564,+-77.686109(27169)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27169) map </A>","Latitude":"40.847564","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Centre Hall","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Centre Hall","Date Submitted":"12/30/2010 12:58 UTC","Case Number":"27169","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27169.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27169.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle"}
