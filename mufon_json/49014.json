I then observed a standard small aircraft behind it. The red light then seemed to pause for a minute or 2 I called inside the house for my husband to come out who saw it as well. We watched it slowly change from a north path to a sudden change to a westerly flight path. At that time we called the kids to come out and see it. We all watched it fly slowly over the western low hills over the military base (Behind the low mountains). It was followed by what sounded like a small standard plane. We all watched it for a full 2 minutes until it was out of out of sight behind the low mountains. No recording was possible due to outside light sources in the neighborhood."],"Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Bright blinking red light over military gun rang followed by aircraft with standard light","Source":"MUFON"}
