{"Case Number":"6589","Region":"Connecticut","Disposition":"IFO","divs":["Sighting DetailsObject hovering in sky then darting left right up down with several dif light colors. Object was first seen approx 11 days ago and not seen again until March 18, 2007. First sighting was dismissed as a possible satelite or star. Upon seeing the object a second time on March 18th we started recording video footage. We recorded footage for 4 min and 11 seconds at which time the battery ran out. We captured the footage into a computer and with digital zooming had some startling and suprising results that we are interested in sharing. The footage was filmed on a Canon GL-2 at 16:9 ratio. We do not feel comfortable posting the footage via the web. For additional info please contact us directly. Below you will see a few frames attached as stills, that are zoomed at 330%.
