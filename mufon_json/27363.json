{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/11/2011 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsStrange lights were reported to have been seen by many people in the area of Newton Alabama. Many 911 calls came in. My husband, who works on Fort Rucker, called me to say that some military operations were shut down because of these lights. People he works with reported they had seen many black government vehicles rushing to the Newton area where these lights were being reported. One co worker said he found his truck had been moved unexplainably to the end of his driveway when he woke up this morning. My husband also said the military was already trying to keep a lid on this event, and telling people not to talk about it. Nothing in the news at this time. I am still seeking more information."],"Summary":"Strange lights","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Newton","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"31.335172","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Newton","There was one other sighting in Newton on or around January 11th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/12/2011 10:25 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.335172,+-85.605213(27363)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27363) map </A>","Longitude":"-85.605213","Region":"Alabama","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27363.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27363.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"27363","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01122011-0004"}
