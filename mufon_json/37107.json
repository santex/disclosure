Were watching our 3 grand children and I happend to look up and there were two white saucer orb things almost directly above us. I have seen these same things sometimes 3 times a week but my wife was never home to show me how to use her camera. She was there this time though. These litterally stayed still when I told my wife I was going in to get the camera and started moving again when I got back outside. I then pointed to one when my wife lost sight of one. I pointed it out and jokingly said stop please and she was shocked when it did stop. This one was the one picture that appears to be dropping plasma or whatever it is behind the tree. They stayed about 10 minutes this time and then vanished."],"Case Number":"37107"}
