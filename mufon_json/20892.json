In just a couple of seconds l joined her on the deck.Shana exclaimed \"look Mike...Look up there!\"The sky was clear and our view unobstructed.When I looked up I was shocked to see above us ,moving at what appeared to be a high rate of speed,seven or eight white starlike lights.It was hard to determine the exact number as they were manuevering in and out,back and forth,and around eachother.The movements,while I am by no means an expert,were not possible by conventional aircraft.All of the lights traveled at the exact same speed and in the exact same direction across the sky.The direction of travel was WNW to ESE.No sound was evident and they had left our field of view within 30 seconds of my arrival outdoors.I hope this information will be of use.You are welcome to speak to myself or my wife,we would like to be as helpful as possible.Thank you for your time."],"Region":"Illinois","City":"Pittsfield","Date Submitted":"12/05/2009 11:05 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Grouping of 7 or 8 starlike white lights.","Latitude":"39.611385","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12052009-0013","Case Number":"20892","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"12/05/2009 09:26 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None"}
