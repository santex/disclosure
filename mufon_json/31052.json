Beginning in the middle of July we started noticing stars that would just take off at a high rate of speed and swap locations in the sky. Some would vanish and some would just move around in different directions. We see about 10 to 15 of these a night. It is august 20th now and we are still seeing them. We have no camera that is clear enough to veiw these objects let alone capture any. They seem to be getting more and more friendly and showing up everynight. Couple days back we saw a football sized craft fly right over our heads making little to no noise. It wasn't even flying fast enough to stay in the air but it did. We just want to know what these are and why they are picking my back yard to play with."],"Longitude":"-69.35917","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Palmyra","There was one other sighting in Palmyra on or around August 1st 2011"],"Date of the Event":"08/01/2011 09:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"star like objects plus really large craft","Source":"MUFON","City":"Palmyra","Country":"United States","Latitude":"44.84639","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.84639,+-69.35917(31052)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31052) map </A>","Region":"Maine","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"04:00:00","Case Number":"31052"}
