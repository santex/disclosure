{"Summary":"More photos of ORB shaped objects in the skies above London, Ontario - Canada","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/22/2008 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile having a cigarette-break on my balcony, I photographed these ORB shaped objects, looking at the East side of my view. They were really far away, but I could see them moving in what appeared as slow erratic maneuvers. You will have to MAGNIFY the pics (I highlighted the outer area of the ORB shapes with YELLOW) to see the objects. The time is on these photos (just figured out how), along with the date. The skies have been really \"active\" above London, Ontario lately; I can only wish I knew why."],"Country":"Canada","trends":[""],"Latitude":"51.256265","Case Number":"13212","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Longitude":"-85.317874","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13212.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13212_submitter_file1__HPIM0716-highlighted.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13212_submitter_file2__HPIM0719-highlighted.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13212.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-10242008-0015","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/22/2008 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ontario","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.256265,+-85.317874(13212)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13212) map </A>"}
