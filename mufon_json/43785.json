The eastern section of the room had a large window facing the ocean. I saw a bright orange light that we thought was from a boat on the ocean. We turned off all the lights in the house and went outside to get a better look at it. It was then that we noticed the light was too high off the horizon (about 10 degrees). I had a set of binoculars sitting on the deck and used them to get a better look at the object. It was a pulsing orange light that appeared to change shape as I looked at it. Within a minute or so another object appeared to the right of the first. This one was slightly higher than the other. The distances between the two objects were about a ruler���s length away from each other (if you held a ruler at arms length). The objects would take turns fading out and back again. They began to appear closer together. We watched the objects for about a half hour when they both faded out. I decided to take a shower while my fianc��� watched for them to come back. She came to the bathroom to tell me that one of the objects came back. I hurried back outside to see that there was one very bright one. When I looked at it with the binoculars, it was two objects very close together and separating. I then noticed the very same thing with another object. We were now looking at four objects that were working into the shape of a V. The base of the V was pointing towards the ocean. This lasted for about another half hour and they slowly faded out, one at a time. This was a very interesting sighting. I could see where the ocean was and sky began. These objects were not lights from boats. The distance from the ocean was too far and the behavior of the objects would not suggest conventional aircraft. Location of sighting from shore: 18 S 231392 3765261 ---- UTM WEATHER PARTLY CLOUDY - TEMP. ABOUT 50 DEGREES. STARS COULD BE SEEN IN THE NIGHT SKY.
