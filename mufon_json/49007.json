My girlfriend (Crystal) was inside yet coming to join us. As Pat and I were talking I happened to look towards the western sky and saw what looked like a star but it was moving slowly from the south to the north before fading out. If you were to hold a ruler at arms length that's about the distance it traveled across the sky. Pat and I both were saying \"what the hell is that?\" About 30 seconds after it disappeared Crystal came out and teased us when we told her.... until 5 minutes later it was back, and did the exact same thing. Same spot. Same speed. Another 5 minutes, same thing again. 3 times total, never saw it again. I'm not good at judging distances distances but whatever it was was VERY far away. From our perspective it seemed to be moving slow, but I'm betting the distance it crossed was many miles in a short period of time. I'm certain this was not a plane."],"Case Number":"49007","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.071508,+-88.232315(49007)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49007) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"43.071508","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Pewaukee","Log Number":"US-07172013-0008","Longitude":"-88.232315","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Pewaukee","There was one other sighting in Pewaukee on or around July 17th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"07/17/2013 01:24 UTC"}
