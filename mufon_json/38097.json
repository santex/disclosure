Noticed a black to dark gray, measurable (longer than a jet liner), rectangular shape object tumbling below cirrus clouds (they were probably 35K - 40K Alt from my flying experience) periodically reflecting sunlight (golden flash) as it tumbled lengthwise. It traveled from SSW to SSE in a matter or 40 secs���. I estimate that it was no more than a mile high, most likely lower, based upon my familiarity with observing jet planes flying overhead from PVD. I am 65 yrs old, an amateur astronomer, and have never seen anything like this, EVER. If not for the shape and speed, I would think it was a released helium baloon from a child's event. This was not the case. I estimate that this object was moving at approximately 200- 400 mph. I am a professional civil engineer and my wife, who also observed this, is a high school teacher. We are in our mid-60's.
