{"divs":["sighting detailsmy daughter and i witnessed his object. it is still there as we speak and we have taken pretty good pictures of it. it has bright lights, seems like a really big round one in the center, and other light on the right side - which is smaller. it has been hoovering and sometimes it moves to the side - more or less in the same area. you see at least 6 beams of lights\\front & back as well. looking at the sky is one of my hobbies and what called my attention is that this item is at times stationary - no noise, and hooveringas well as moving sideways. i am making this report at 9:00, but this object is still there and behaving in the same fashion. no noise is heard. there seems to be some metalic gray material around it...as far as i can see. pretty clear skies here in orlando. this is happening on the corner of semoran blvd & curry ford - in a shopping plaza so many people are witnessing it as well."],"trends":["There have been 112 other sightings in Orlando","There were no other sightings in Orlando on or around January 26th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45423.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45423.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"28.523644","City":"Orlando","Summary":"Its still there!
