It cought my eye enough to look at it. It had rapidly blinking white lights that appeared to fly in a zigzag motion for a short period of time before darting off to the right, that is when I went outside with my husband to look at it. We noticed it was oval to disc shaped, flying fairly low, with all white pulsating lights almost giving it a spinning appearance. The lights seemed to be alternating on and off. It was silent. It moved quickly and was out of view within minutes."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/10/2009 07:30 UTC","Tags":"City"}
