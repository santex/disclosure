I kept my ufo camera right next to the door on top of a cabinet at that time so i grabbed it as quick as I could, took these seconds of video then as I was refocusing I could not find it anymore, but I could hear it. There was a buzzing hum coming from the object that sounded like a really muffled prop plane"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Ripon","There were no other sightings in Ripon on or around August 16th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34878.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34878.html"],"Log Number":"US-01152012-0023"}
