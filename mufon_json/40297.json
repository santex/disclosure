Suddenly all lights went off & black object continued.","divs":["Sighting DetailsFrom my kitchen window I could see in the western sky a red blinking light that appeared to be rising slowly. The lights seemed to be blinking slowly. At first I thought it was fireworks rising from the ground. I was very curious so I went out on my deck. Now the object was moving in a straight line as an airplane or helicopter would do. The object seemed to be flying at an altitude that a helicopter or small plane would fly. I heard no sound as the object headed southeastward. After about a minute or two of watching it all the lights suddenly went out. Because there was still some light in the sky from the recent sunset, I was able to see what appeared to be a diamond or square shaped black object moving on a straight path. I followed it until I could no longer see it. I did not see any lights come back on & I never heard a sound."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07062012-0012","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.355001,+-87.415746(40297)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40297) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40297.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40297.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 08:45 UTC"}
