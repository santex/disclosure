Ilooked up and saw 12-15 disc shaped objects flying in a infinite shaped motion. I showed a few friends who also saw the lights. They continued flying for aboutfive minutes when all of the sudden they steadily grew brighter and then shotoff in all different directions. I called the local tlelevision stations andreported what i had seen. Of course their response was as expected. They triedto tell me that Ihad seen some weather related phenomena. Which from myperspective was completely and utterly impossible. What I had seen could nothave been swamp gas, or venus for that matter. It was I am convinced somethingnot explainable by any means so for. I hope that I have something here that canbe substantiated. This was only the first sighting."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2063.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2063.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
