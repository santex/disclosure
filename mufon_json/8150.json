Northwest to Southeast, I noticed it since it didnt look like an airplane as it was bright red. It went Northwest, and immediately reversed direction and went Southeast. I have seen it approx three times so far as it keeps repeating the pattern. It does not blink like an airplane, and airplanes cannot reverse direction as quickly as this thing has. Also it travels at a higher rate of speed than a plane."],"Log Number":"US-10152007-0008"}
