In my driveway cleaning my barbecue. 2. I just happened to look north, slightly up. 3. There were two equally bright \"stars\", one directly above the other that I didn't recall seeing before. They did not seem to be moving. 4. Two equally bright \"stars\" that were in a vertical line. As I was looking at them, the bottom one slowly dimmed until I couldn't see it anymore. Then the top one did the same thing. About an hour later the same thing happened but there was only one \"star\" this time. 5. I just stood there thinking that stars shouldn't do that. I didn't think they were aircraft as I couldn't see a green or red light attached to them as an aircraft would. 6. As I said, they slowly dimmed until I couldn't see them."],"Longitude":"-119.285808","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3947.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3947.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON"}
