It then stopped and hovered over the house next door (still very high). I watched as it moved up, down, went to the side for about 10 feet, went back up, straight down about 15 feet, hovered again for quite awhile, then shot straight up and out of sight.This is nothing new to us, the only thing new was this was the first one that I have witnessed during the daytime. I always feel elation and a sense of peace when I see these."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"bright white orb, very high up, moved up and down, side to side then ascended and vanished","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48095.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48095.html"],"Longitude":"-98.088292","Date Submitted":"06/12/2013 06:29 UTC","Case Number":"48095","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/10/2013 07:10 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"29.769455","City":"New Braunfels","Log Number":"US-06122013-0015","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:09:03","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
