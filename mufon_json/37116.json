Went out with camera and observes light still moving same direction then hovered and disappeared. Took a short movie but quality is poor. Then second light appeared same direction color and MO. Light also disappeared as other one did. I observed an helicopter flying same path right after second light disappeared. Lights had no noise and was a bright orange &pulsating. Helicopter was very loud. I was very excited and shaking all at once. I am used to planes flying over my area towards palm beach airport. this was completely different objects without blinking or engine noise. Also quite big compare to an approaching plane."]}
