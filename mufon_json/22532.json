{"divs":["Sighting Detailsas my friend (pilot and works for spirit airlines) and i were looking up at the downtown Miami skyline i noticed a small flying object in the sky. it was a triangular shape with red lights. it moved slowly and descended down onto the water it landed. it was close enough for me to recognize that it wasn't a plane and it made no noise. it drifted to the right and stopped for a few minutes. i noticed a small boat that passed by it and the ufo's light shut off and after the boat passed it turned back on. then the ufo drifted to the left about a mile then the lights went off again and it disappeared from my sight.."],"Date Submitted":"03/28/2010 12:12 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","City":"Miami","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"03/22/2010 11:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-80.222899","Latitude":"25.797269","Object Shape":"Disc, Fireball, Triangle","Summary":"small, with red lights","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22532.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22532_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22532.html"],"Log Number":"US-03282010-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.797269,+-80.222899(22532)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22532) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"22532","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There were no other sightings in Miami on or around March 22nd 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
