{"Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"Pink Teddy Bear Riding A Snake in mid air?","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were at The Jefferson MONTICELLO at Charlottesville Virginia. We were walking the Flower Garden of the Plantationat about 11:30 AM. Taking pictures of the grounds, Then taking Pictures of the Jefferson Home. When I down loaded the pictures I noticed something strange in the pictures. Very out of the ordinary. It looks like a Pink Teddy Bear riding a Pink Snake, with the arms of the Teddy Bear pointed up. When I took the picture I don't recall seeing this in the air before. I didn't see any balloons in the air as we were walking. Any help would be great.
