We were riding around on the lake looking at all the lovely homes we stoped the boat to see something that showed up on the fish finder and we fished for a bit .. I was sitting in the back of the boat and admireing the moon which looked full and was in the sky in the middle of the afternoon then all the sudden I wittnessed a bright light in the sky to the left of the moon it looked very high in the shy and looked small because of the distance .. It was moving very fast to the other side of the moon and then comeing back .. It moved so fast before I could blink my eye .. It would do this same thing four or five different times , each time it would just disapear and return .. I was the only one on the boat that could see this ... I was asking the other girls if they could see it because it was so exciting to me but the other girls kept talking and teased me and said do you need some help honey and laughing at me .. I know what I saw and will never forget it .. I want to know what it was .. I was not able to get any pictures at the time because I left my phone on shore so it would not get wet .. I wish I had some photos to share maybe then someone would believe me .. Left here wondering !!
