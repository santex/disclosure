I noticed a bright orange light in the sky, just above the trees. For a moment, i thought it was mars. I told my dad to stop the truck when I realized there were two and then they faded out. We watched for about a minute and they came back on, about 15 degrees to the east. We watched them for about twenty seconds and they faded again. Less than a minute later, they reappeared again in the original location and faded after a few seconds. We watched for several minutes more and didn't see anything. After we got on the highway we saw and heard a helicopter fly over us going in the same direction of the lights, it was very low. Later, my mother heard several helicopters fly over our house, not far from the sighting, going in the same direction"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.221386","Region":"Alabama","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/05/2012 08:30 UTC","Case Number":"42327","Summary":"two orange lights would light up and fade out, would appear in another location"}
