It caught my attention, I observed it for just a few minutes, 5 minutes or less, it slowly started getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared completely within 1 to 2 minutes, then I called my daughter she came out and saw it appear again getting larger and larger then stopped for a few moments then started getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared again completely, very weird. Observed a few more planes in the area more than usual, stayed out for another 30 minutes with nothing else happening. Just wondering if anybody else saw it.
