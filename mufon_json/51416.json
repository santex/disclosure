The lights came from the south and the lights were not as bright at first, but brightened when they came in front of the trees and passed in front of the trees while there were deer in the field below them. We have four different photos of these lights. We have photos of the lights and also the SD card from the camera. Last year we also got and unusual \"moon\" light picture which people said was an orb from another game camera. This \"moon\" orb was also in front of the trees."],"Longitude":"-78.074055","Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10092013-0017","Object Features":"Other","City":"Karthaus","Date Submitted":"10/09/2013 08:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet"}
