The color, light and motion of the object immediately caught my eye. It was a pulsating red and orange orb. Since I witnessed the meteor streak across the Wisconsin sky in April of 2010 I am particularly attuned to celestial phenomena. This was something different. Unlike the meteor or even a firework its motion was not constant. It was choppy and appeared to start and stop and change directions. I had a small video camera on me and was able to capture a few seconds of the object in the sky. However there was too much artificial light interference and obstructions like trees and tall buildings for the video to be good. The video is in slow motion at about half speed. The object can be seen at 10 seconds and again at 20 and 25 seconds."],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:38 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40268.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40268.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.629482,+-74.029469(40268)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40268) map </A>","Summary":"Bay Ridge, Brooklyn July 4th 2012","Log Number":"US-07052012-0092","Longitude":"-74.029469","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere"}
