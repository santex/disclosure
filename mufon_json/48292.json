Didn't notice anything at the time but when I downloaded the images tonight, I noticed a full moon-like something just above the horizon across the harbor in one photo. The timestamp on the photo is 9:19:24 pm (it looks like my time on my camera is set 26 min. fast, so the real-time would have been about 8:53:24 p.m.). The thing does not appear in the next photo, which was taken 30 seconds later, or the previous photo, which was taken approximately 15 min. earlier."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.415241,+-71.373887(48292)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48292) map </A>","Summary":"there is a full moon-like thing just above horizon in photo i took of sunset yesterday - will email it if u want 2 c it"}
