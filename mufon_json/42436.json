{"Summary":"4 flashing lights rotating , coming to center and back out again.","Country":"United States","Case Number":"42436","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Virginia","Log Number":"US-09102012-0009","Sighting Duration":"02:03:00","Object Shape":"Cylinder","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at home and went out onto the balcony of my apartment to look at the stars as I always do. When I looked up I saw the lights rotating and coming back to a center point, then spreading out and rotating again. At first I wondered if, because of the sparse cloud cover, if it might be spot lights from airport. It was a center light, a soft white light, edges mutted by a little cloud cover, then separated and broke off into 4 lights, expanding out into a large circle, rotating and then coming back again only to keep repeating. This went on for over 2 hours. I was a little spooked, but excited as I had not seen a ufo in many years. I lost signt of the object when I finally came indoors."],"trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Fredericksburg","There were 2 other sightings in Fredericksburg on or around September 8th 2012"],"Latitude":"38.292065","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42436.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42436.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/10/2012 07:16 UTC","Longitude":"-77.531191","City":"Fredericksburg","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/08/2012 10:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.292065,+-77.531191(42436)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42436) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
