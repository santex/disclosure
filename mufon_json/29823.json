{"City":"Grassy","Latitude":"37.260886","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I, my Neighbor and his grandson were sitting on our front porch which faces to the west. I saw a round light appear in the western sky slowly move across the sky to the east. I pointed the object out to the others and we moved out into our front yard to view the object. The object appeared to be very high and moved at a slow steady pace and appeared to slightly zig zag, yet keep returning to a steady easterly course. The ofject appeared to be a round white light. There were no \"flashing lights nor sound\". When the object passed over our house we moved to the side of the house to keep the object in view. As the object continued to the east it became dimmer and then just disappeared before it reached the eastern horizon. Tonight, the sky was very clear and the stars were very visible. We also saw several aircraft \"with flashing light\" pass overhead, and we could also hear the engine noise from the aircraft. The object took about four minutes to travel across the sky."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.260886,+-90.123717(29823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29823) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/01/2011 03:52 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Missouri","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29823.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29823.html"],"Summary":"Round white light moved across the sky","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07012011-0004","Longitude":"-90.123717","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Grassy","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"29823","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/30/2011 12:00 UTC"}
