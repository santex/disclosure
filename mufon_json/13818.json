we have been seeing unusual occurrences in the sky almost nightly for the past several weeks since the first unusual occurrence,i have been compelled to watch the night sky. first sighting (lasted about 90 seconds) ��� i saw a brightly lit object run through the sky from west to south. objects origination point is unknown; as object raced to the west i heard a strange high pitch sound. object disappeared after it moved to the west and out of my viewing range. second sighting (lasted about 2 minutes) ��� within 2 to 4 minutes following the first sighting i saw a triangle shaped craft moving from north to south, it appeared to be silver\\metallic in appearance with no hard or sharp edges; all points on the object seem to be rounded in appearance as moved low over our neighbor���s house. the craft made absolutely no sound as it disappeared to the south over the tree line. third sighting (lasted for a one to two seconds) ��� i was looking at the sky in the south direction and saw a star looking object fizzle out toward the east, this may just have been a meteor in the sky, but due the first two sighting i thought it should be noted. fourth sighting (lasted for a one to two seconds) ��� my two sons joined my outside shortly after the third sighting, i told them about the first, second and third sightings and instructed them to look towards specific directions in the sky, my oldest son i instructed to look north and northwest, my youngest son i instructed to look towards the northeast and i resumed looking to the south, southwest and southeast. as the three of us looked in different directions assuring we did not miss anything that may pop up in the sky for a brief moment my youngest son was looking toward the south and said he had saw the silver triangle shaped craft move from the tree line briefly and went back out of sight behind the tree line. i was able to confirm that he saw exactly what i did during the second sighting due to the fact the only information i had giving him about this object was that is was shaped like a triangle, he was never told of the color or what it appeared to look like other than shape. fifth sighting (lasted about 3 to 4 minutes) ��� my oldest son who was looking north and northwest alerted me to what he was seeing, my oldest son is highly into in astronomy and science and is the biggest skeptic i know. he always has a logical reason things that seem to move and look weird in the sky, however this time that was not the case. the object my oldest son saw looked like venus looks in the sky when viewable; the major difference was this object was more of a redder hue than venus is. now there is no mistaken that this object was not venus as the object was moving south to southwest and then to the north, as the object was moving it looked approximately the size of a basket ball the shape appeared to be spherical once the object turned to the north my oldest son stated it looked as if the object elongated and it began to grow dimmer, dimmer again and dimmer once more and then it was gone. it looked as if it completely disappeared or move out of the atmosphere so fast it was not viewable to us with the naked eye. sixth sighting (lasted about 3 minutes) ��� this sighting was indeed the strangest, shortly following the fifth sighting we had with the glowing spherical object, we saw another star like object in the sky overhead, this one was also moving in the north direction, the occurrence that made this one the strangest is not the shape, size, and movement of the object, it was what seemed to be chasing this object. not 2 seconds after we saw this object take off in the sky moving north, a jet or plane and i am not sure the type or if it was commercial or military took off after it. the object is was after was still moving in the north direction and the jet\\plane was gaining on it, this went off for a minute or so and at this point my sons and i thought it was going to catch the star like object as it at this point was real close to it. as soon as the jet\\plane caught up, the object immediately accelerated and shot up higher in the sky from the jet\\plane. the jet\\plane looked like it was trying to follow, but a second later return to the position it was at before the object took off higher in the sky. i am not sure if the object climbed to high for the jet\\plane to follow, but it was very apparent, what ever this star liked object was it was definitely after it. our feelings about these events and the several others we have had in the past several weeks have been of excitement, baffled and very intrigued about what we are seeing. my husband, two sons and i are of sound mind and above average intelligence, we are very logical and not ones to jump to the conclusion that what we saw was in fact of alien origin, however what we have seen is nothing we can identify through first hand knowledge or through internet research. i unfortunately do not have any pictures or video's, my camera does not take good pictures in the dark and i do not have a video camer, however i will be borrowing my in-laws video camera tonight to have on hand just in case these objects show up again."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Several objects seen over Jacksonville, Florida for a 1 to 2 hour duration.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.339184,+-81.651781(13818)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13818) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13818.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13818.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like, Triangle","Case Number":"13818","City":"Jacksonville","Date Submitted":"11/18/2008 06:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-11192008-0009","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/18/2008 06:30 UTC"}
