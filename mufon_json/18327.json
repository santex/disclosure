IT WENT TO DIFFERENT SHADES OF BRIGHT RED TO DULL ORANGE TO A TOTAL FADE OUT... I DO THINK THIS OBJECT WAS ALSO MAN-MADE FOR IT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE THE MAIN TANK ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE, HOWEVER NO SPACE SHUTTLE LAUNCH WAS MADE AT THAT TIME & I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW IF THE MAIN TANK IS RELEASED IN OUTER SPACE??? I ALSO CALLED THE NEW MEXICO STATE POLICE IN THE TIME FRAME OF ONE MINUTE AFTER THE SITING & THEY INFORMED ME TO CONTACT THE WHITE SANDS MILITARY POLICE... THE VERY NEXT DAY I DID CALL THE MILITARY POLICE AT WHITE SANDS, THEY STATED THAT A SMALL MISSILE WAS LAUNCHED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME OR AT 1:30 A.M. HOWEVER IT WAS DIRECTLY EAST OF MY LOCATION & IT WAS NOT ANY KIND OF NEAR OBITAL MISSILE LAUNCH!!! MY MAIN ??? IS I DO NOT KNOW IF THE MAIN SHUTTLE TANK STAYS IN ORBIT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME & IF ANY OTHER NATIONS HAVE ANYTHING THAT LARGE??? THIS SITEING WAS AROUND 2 YEARS BEFORE THE LARGE DELTA TRIANGLE CRAFT WAS SEEN BUT AT THE VERY SAME LOCATION & ADDRESS... CAN YOU PLEASE CONTACT ME WITH ANY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THESE SITEING'S??? THE LAS CRUCES SUN NEWS IS A VERY VERY HIPPY POT-LOVING COLLEGE STUDENT LIBERAL NEWS PAPER THAT IS ALMOST TOTALEE WORTHLESS WHEN IT COMES TO ANY KIND NEWS REPORTING!!!! P.S. LITTLE KID'S & CHILDREN COULD RUN THE LAS CRUCES SUN NEWS MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DO... ALSO WAY BACK IN THE 1970'S MY FATHER AND I HAD A SITEING THAT WAS SO BRIGHT OF A FIRE BALL THAT AT ABOUT 9:30 AT NIGHT & FOR ABOUT 15 TO 20 SECONDS THIS FIREBALL LITE THE WHOLE AREA AT 1430 GROVER DRIVE ALSO IN LAS CRUCES AS BRIGHT AS THE MID-DAY SUN!!!! BUT WITHOUT ANY EXPLOSION SOUND. WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE DID HAVE ANTI-MISSILE MISSILES WITH NUCLEAR TIPPED WARHEADS BUT NO INFO OR DATA OF SUCH A OUTER SPACE DETONATION WAS EVER MADE KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC!!!"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07262009-0019","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cylinder","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.32344,+-106.758054(18327)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18327) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.32344","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/30/2003 01:37 UTC","Longitude":"-106.758054","Date Submitted":"11/30/2003 01:37 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"New Mexico","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
