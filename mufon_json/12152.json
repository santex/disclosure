When they stopped in mid-air, they hung there. I witnessed the scene at a tall window at home with my daughter, whom I awakened from a deep sleep. She witnessed the objects from the same window. I was looking for planes and stars. There were no planes. The stars were faint. I saw these objects darting around a cloud and coming to a complete halt in mid-air. Some hung like long cigars. Some were like boxes. I thought the objects were ufo objects. They were silent. I thought the scene was fascinating. My daughter thought it was beautiful. I thought it was odd that the objects stayed within the window's width, although they seemed at least twenty miles out and about a thousand miles up. We got too tired to watch anymore and went to bed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12152.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12152.html"],"Log Number":"US-08202008-0012","Case Number":"12152","Longitude":"-87.624898","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/08/2008 03:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/08/2008 03:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"01:15:02","Object Shape":"Cigar, Square, Rectagular, Teardrop","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","City":"Chicago","Latitude":"41.884114","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Objects moved quiclky in the eastern sky on August 8th, 2008","Region":"Illinois"}
