Also type in \"ufo new york\" and hit the most recent button. 2 people captured this one. It too almost looks fake, but like the Dallas UFO, it may be worth checking out since it too was recorded by more than one person. Both incidents happened last night during the eclipse."],"Date of the Event":"02/20/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"3 record Dallas UFO, 2 record New York UFO","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9673.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9673.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around February 20th 2008"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"9673"}
