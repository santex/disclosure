The 2 objects moved east slowly, then stopped and hovered. The only thing I could possibly explain them to be at first would be helicopters, but there were no helicopter sounds. They started moving extremely slow eastward again when a 3rd light moving faster than the other two approaced from the West to catch up with the first 2 lights. Ran inside to get my camera, it took between 10 seconds to 15 seconds, by the time i came out the 3rd light was almost indistinct moving way ahead of the other 2 going towards Tigard. The other two were moving fast in that direction and they disappeared."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.79952","Case Number":"41446","Country":"United States"}
