And me and my friend Spyro were having aconversation. We were facing each other when i saw something flying across thesky over his head. At first I thought it was a shooting star but then I thoughtto myself that it was way too bright to be one and the fact that it fadded inand out twice. Ok, so there I was talking to Spyro when suddenly this lightappears in the sky. It looked like a giant fireball about the size of an asprin.It was going what mustve been a 1000 miles an hour cause planes done move thatfast when there that far away and they go 600. This thing was moving about aninch a second. Almost as soon as i saw it I told Spyro to look behind him. Butthen when he look it kinda sped up and faded away.
