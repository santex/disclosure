Our picture window has an unobstructed view of the south and southeast. On a clear day, we can see for over 25 miles. At 8:30 p.m., a group of 12 orange orbs began slowly ascending, southeast of us. The orbs were over 10 miles away, and may have been over National City, the South Bay of San Diego Bay, or even just over the Mexican border. The 12 orbs ascended slowly and gracefully. They moved in a slow, continuous, upward direction. At one point, the 12 orbs separated into at least three groups, and formed two triangles and one rectangle. The 12 orbs came into sight at eye level, or just below, when viewed from our hillside. The orbs slowly disappeared from view when they were high in the air, and approximately 15-20 degrees up. I did not see much movement left to right of the orbs, and did not see them drifting, as if driven by the wind."],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.84722","Date of the Event":"04/26/2013 08:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.27333","City":"San Diego"}
