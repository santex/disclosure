As it got closer to my car I noticed that it was a very large triangle shape, about 3 times the size of an airplane. I pulled out my phone and took 5 pictures of it. The craft appeared to be black, and had white lights around the sides and on the front, and 3 rows of red lights underneath the craft. It moved very slowly and appeared to be hovering more than flying. I opened up my window to see if I could hear any noise and there was nothing. There were also no blinking likes on the object, like you would see on a plane or helicopter. I watched the craft until it disappeared behind trees about 5 minutes after I started watching it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Normal","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"Illinois","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"Large triangle craft with white lights around sides and 3 rows of red lights underneath","Date Submitted":"04/07/2013 08:18 UTC","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.516263,+-88.984501(46663)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46663) map </A>","Log Number":"US-04072013-0018","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46663.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46663.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
