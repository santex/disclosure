{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were comeing from Eastland, headed home at Lake Leon around 10:15 pm...driving South East. Two large bright lights like stars (daughter thought they were stars) in area of Orions Belt. Daughter noticed them...and commented they didn't belong. About 7 minutes or so later (just before we turned on to CR 237...Staff Road...these two lights moved towards each other very very fast...faster than anything I had ever seen. They looked like they meet and then five or six smaller lights dispersed out in a circular pattern away from them and then everything just was gone. Nothing there. My daughter and I discussed how weird that was...while my other daughter who was in the back seat and didn't see it laughed at us....thought we were seeing things."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/10/2008 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"31.971529","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8997.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8997.html"],"Summary":"Two lights suspended thought was stars.
