{"Disposition":"IFO","divs":["sighting detailsi was going south on dixon road toward us 26 when up ahead in the sky in the distance, slightly to the left of dixon road was a glowing light. it was around 9:30 p.m. i was the person on april 17, 2008 who saw the orange orbs over the mall, so i went in pursuit of this object. i had my three grown-up kids with me, my cousin, a friend and my grandbaby. since the road is closed off at dixon there and i could not go straight, i turned right on us 26. i took the first road headed south. i traveled appoximately 6 miles all the while observing this shimmering light in the sky. we reached 200 north, around 700 west, tipton county. we watched this object looking south while we were on 200 north. we all got out and my son started video taping while i used my sony cybershot 15x zoom camera. i had my sony on the \"sport option\" to catch pictures in action. i took around 50 total pictures. i also had my 15 x 70 celestron skymaster binoculars with me. the object was barely moving, just above treetop level. to our eyes it appeared like a bright ball of light. through the binoculars it appeared like a multi-colored object and looked similar to the person's video on youtube of the denver, indiana ufo. but it would change. looking at it in person it usually just appeared to be a large bright orb, but sometimes like two orange orbs. on my sony camera, the pictures turned out like nothing at all we were observing in person. it seemed to have several orbs or organized lights attached to an object, yet we could see no object. a couple of the pictures that have several lights has a bright light that almost looks like fire and smoke surrounding it. the object seemed to be approximately a mile south hovering near the top of the trees clusters. it would move slowly from one end of the trees and then come back from the opposite direction and then repeat this over and over. at one point the object was headed west and descended slowly behind the trees. you can see the light of it as it traveled behind the trees. i had to take my son back to his vehicle so he could leave to go back to ohio since he had to go to work the following morning. it is around 11p.m. we went back the way we came. just as we turned east on us 26 facing dixon road and to the right of us (south) was this big, low flying object. the kids yelled for me to stop the van. i pulled over quickly and we all jumped out. my daughters looked through the binoculars as my son video taped it. we could see this object traveling low at treetop level coming from the south\\southwesterly direction. it headed northeast. it flew over us 26 and looked to be flying over the apartments there. my one daughter who was observing it through the binoculars said it had a band of white lights on it and a few red ones on the rear of it as if they were attached to an object, though she could not see the actual structure of it. she said it was not an airplane. my other daughter said it looked like several lights contained inside this glowing sphere of lights. to me it appeared like a big ball of light that didn't change it's brightness no matter what angle you looked at it. there was no sound involved. it was very close and low and i would have thought we should have heard something. it was very windy that night though. after taking my son back to his car, my older daughter and i went back to the same road where we first observed this orb. it was around 1 a.m. i saw it again and taped it a few seconds when my daughter suggested trying to get closer to it or under it. i don't know the exact roads we traveled but we seemed to be getting closer since the light appeared bigger. we traveled south and west and arrived to a town that had the name of \"watson\" in it. we might have been near goldsmith. i was going to get out and take pictures, which i regret that i didn't now. one of the back country roads had an arrow to the east away from the object and when i got up to a road to bring me back to the west toward it, it was flying northwest at a great speed. the bright orb was quickly turning into a small light in the sky. i tried to follow toward it and periodically would stop and take pictures toward it. i ended up in russiaville, indiana and realize i had lost it. it was now appoximately 3:30 a.m. i decided to give up the chase. i do have video and pictures. i hope it will help to solve or disclose something about this phenomenon."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.127603","trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in
