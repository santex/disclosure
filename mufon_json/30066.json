There was absolutely no sound (as i could tell) then seemed to disappear, there was what seemed like 8 dim orange like lights throughout the shape of the craft. Unfortunately it happened so fast i didn't have time even to reach for my camera which was in my pocket."],"Summary":"fly over of chevron shaped ufo","City":"Biograd na Moru","Latitude":"43.937831","Tags":"City","Case Number":"30066"}
