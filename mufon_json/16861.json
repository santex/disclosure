{"Log Number":"US-05102009-0007","Longitude":"-86.577447","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Tennessee","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving with a co-driver east on I-40 into North Carolina before the tunnels in the Tennesee Smokey Mountains. I was taking still pictures with my digital Canon Powershot A630. I shot a picture I thought would be a nice landscape photo of a river pointing out the window with the window up. There are spots on the window, but they are in the upper right of the picture. There were no spots on the middle of the photo. I put the picture on the magnifying feature and noticed a white light around the object that is a blur. Then I put it on the edit feature of my computer to adjust the bright and contrast features at fully magnified. It has a ring of light or energy around it and when the bright is turned up or down the inner shape shows itself to be a disk shape brighter than the sky. I don't know what this could be. There are no housing developements, or power lines. Meybe you can use some technology on this digital image to determine what it might be. This picture is not edited. I can send the card it is on if it draws your interest."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16861.html"],"trends":[""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/18/2009 02:50 UTC","Case Number":"16861","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Summary":"I was taking pictures through the passenger window of the semi tractor.","Date of the Event":"04/18/2009 02:50 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.521671,+-86.577447(16861)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16861) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.521671","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO"}
