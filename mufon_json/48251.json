{"Sighting Duration":"00:12:06","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were taking a bike ride through beaver creek, and stopped to observe the sky. Looking at the stars before leaving I spotted what looked like a star, but it was moving. It was moving in a straight path then would drop and change direction. The closer it got to us overhead it began glowing brighter. It looked like a moving star but when looking at it had a glow that made 3 beams of light look projected off the front of it. It also looked like a saturn shape. It did not change color just glowed white and bright like a star. After stopping overhead of us it continued on its way then sped up super quick and dimmed out to a star type of light-then completely vanished."],"Case Number":"48251","Object Features":"None","Region":"Michigan","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Saturn-like, Sphere, Star-like","Date of the Event":"06/18/2013 10:47 UTC","Log Number":"US-06192013-0011","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Sterling Heights","There were no other sightings in Sterling Heights on or around June 18th 2013"],"City":"Sterling Heights","Latitude":"42.543894","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-83.06366","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"UFO spotted over park","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48251.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48251.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/19/2013 01:07 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.543894,+-83.06366(48251)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48251) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
