My wife, myself and my children were driving N on 71 hwy, through Belton, MO. Off to the E-NE of the highway, we saw lights that were intermingled with fireworks. Initially we dismissed them as still burning fireworks, but they stayed there for a solid 5 minutes or more. 3 appeared to form a very large triangle, and were completely stationary. We observed these lights from a distance for approx. 5 minutes, and they continued to stay in this pattern for the entire time they were off to our front and right, as we passed, and until we could no longer see them in the distance behind us. We also saw 2-3 more in the general area, but not forming the triangle shape. At no time did they move, they were stationary the whole time."],"Longitude":"-94.527148"}
