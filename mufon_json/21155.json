{"divs":["sighting detailsi first noticed the craft soon after sitting down to christmas dinner. it was an extremely clear day with visibility out to at least 50 miles. it was quite bright outside as a result of the clear skies. out of the corner of my eye, i saw something silver-colored and highly reflective. it looked metallic. it was 4-6 miles out, and somewhere between 1000 and 1500 feet. keep in mind these are estimates. they were made the day after the sighting after reviewing local maps. what struck me initially was that the shape and reflectiveness made me think \"airplane,\" but the crafts' leisurely low speed bank then brought me to \"helicopter.\" i watched the craft intently for a few seconds, trying to compare what i was seeing to anything else i had ever seen. i noted the absence of wings and helicopter blades. there was also an absence of sound. i feel the lack of sound is an important point because aircraft regularly fly in and around the chehalem valley and are audible inside the house with he windows closed. i also noticed that the entire shape of the craft was not immediately discernible. the craft was so reflective that part of the craft was always obscured by glare. i could see however, that the craft had a rounded shape with either end looking roughly similar. the glare\\reflectiveness seemed to move across the craft as a sort of slow pulse. the glare sort of looked like an intermittent silver doughnut or ovoid sphere pulsing around the craft. kind of. again i have no basis for comparison. after about 5-6 seconds i looked around the dinner table to see if anyone was looking where i was. no one had looked outside and everyone else was engrossed in conversation. i decided against telling everyone to look out the window because i figured i was just looking at a silver airplane from a weird angle. then i realized the sun was on roughly the opposite side of the craft from the silver glare\\reflectiveness. i quickly looked back out the window after no more than 1-2 seconds and the craft was gone. then i had a sinking feeling, like a sense of dread. no aircraft i have ever seen could have moved out of my field of view that quickly. i could simply see too much of the valley for an aircraft to leave my field of view that quickly."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc, Flash, Oval, Saturn-like, Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/26/2009 05:04 UTC","Summary":"Slow moving highly reflective possibly flashing rounded craft was seen briefly then dissapeared.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-123.010935","Region":"Oregon","Latitude":"45.278173","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.278173,+-123.010935(21155)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21155) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12262009-0016","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21155.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21155.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Dundee","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Dundee","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/25/2009 03:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"21155","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
