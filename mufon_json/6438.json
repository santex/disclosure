The flash was tiny, like a star, very high up. It faded and moved slowly over the course of several seconds. My first impression was that this was a satellite reflecting the sun. But upon further consideration, I don't think this is true. Here's why. It was moving from east to west. And it must have been very high up to be able to reflect the sun, as it was between the sun and me, so to speak. That is to say, it was between a point directly overhead and the sun in the east, in the eastern half of the sky, in the morning. I am certain that this was some sort of object because it was moving, as I stated earlier. Over the course of about five seconds, it disappeared entirely."],"Summary":"I saw something high up seem to flash in the sunlight before fading from sight.","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"02/22/2007 08:10 UTC","Case Number":"6438","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.157464,+-90.04062(6438)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6438) map </A>","Latitude":"35.157464","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/22/2007 08:10 UTC","Log Number":"US-02222007-0003","Longitude":"-90.04062","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Memphis","Region":"Tennessee","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash"}
