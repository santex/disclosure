It was in the area the next night same time but in a little different area doing the same thing.Moving around.It stayed in the area till January because some coon hunters witnessed it then."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.218421,+-82.348038(30402)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30402) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"31.218421","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Waycross","There was one other sighting in Waycross on or around November 14th 2007"],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Triangle","Region":"Georgia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.348038","Country":"United States"}
