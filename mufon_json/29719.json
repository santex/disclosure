Walking down the hill to my dorm I spotted this very bright silvery white oval shaped light with a short tail which seemed to intermittenly turn off and on , off and on as it sped through the sky. Then it disappeared over the horizon. it was moving extremely fast. the whole sighting lasted maybe 4 or 5 seconds. The only reason i'm reporting this is because of the june 25 report from Venezuela of the exact same description only their color was descrbed as luminescent green and white in the middle as opposed to the flash bulb silvery white I observed."],"Case Number":"29719","Object Shape":"Flash","Tags":"City"}
