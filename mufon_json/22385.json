This sighting took place on Thursday night September 27, 2001. I might also add that one of the friends with me was an active FBI agent and also the driver of the vehicle. We were coming out of Richmond, Virginia at 11:00 PM on the above date when we approached exit 58 on the southbound side of Interstate 95. On one side to the west is state route 150 with high tension electrical lines on the east running parallel to I-95 and (under construction at the time) to the west is Interstate 895 overpass. We sighted a very odd flying object going from west to east. What was strange about this is that the object had come in UNDER the electrical lines and was lit up in very bright white lights. The shape was that of a sailor���s cap. This object couldn���t have been 75 feet overhead. The vehicle was maybe 25 feet square and10-12 feet tall. We had pulled onto the side of the road to watch this spectacle which had also attracted the attention of several vehicles on the northbound side of I-95. The object hovered over the roadway���s columns for a few minutes and then very slowly headed east with absolutely no sound. We had a clear view for probably 8-10 minutes. I have seen pictures of lots of different shapes of UFOs, but I have never seen or heard of anything like this. Do you have any ideas? We didn���t have a camera or video camera to take pictures of this. All three of us have discussed this several times and agree to what we saw. All three of us are over 50 were not hallucinating, on drugs, or drinking, just normal family men."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"22385","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-77.432138","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Richmond","There were no other sightings in Richmond on or around September 27th 2001"],"Latitude":"37.542815","Log Number":"US-03192010-0016","City":"Richmond","Date of the Event":"09/27/2001 11:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.542815,+-77.432138(22385)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22385) map </A>"}
