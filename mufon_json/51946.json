In all the organic shapes of the clouds, a straight line caught my eye. It didn't extend all the way to the ground at first, but was hanging from the bottom of the clouds. It tilted at about 60 degrees downward and eventually after a minute straightened to a vertical wire extending from cloud to treeline. After another couple minutes it's upper connection to the clouds terminated and it 'fell' behind treeline. As if a shiny massive fishing line fell, following its own path perfectly and ended behind the trees. I was in a state of wonder and curiosity upon seeing this oddity. I see other similar reports out there. Strange."]}
