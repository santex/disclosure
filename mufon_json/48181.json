Noticed bright red object above my building flying from west to east slowly. At first I thought it was a plane but after watching it I knew it wasn't. Had no plane lights. It brightened from bright bright red to dim orange in a non specific pattern. I looked away for a second to throw recycling away in the bin & was gone. No clouds. No sounds. Just vanished. Very strange."],"Country":"United States"}
