(about 2 miles south of me)but there was no sound at all,i could still here the airliner in the sky. and it was lined up wrong for a landing there. after about 10 to 15 seconds the light dimmed down but not out and took off towards the east south\\east.it got dimmer than most of the stars in the sky in about 5 to 7 seconds as it was moving. i had to strain to see it once it finished moving. i still saw it heeding what looked like the east south\\east when it was dim then it stopped and went the other direction(north) after around 5 seconds later i lost it . it went a good 8 fingers towards the north before i lost it. when it was dim it look like a satellite in the sky but when it turned to head the other direction i knew it was not a satellite. i saw no shape just wight, very bright light, it just appeared as far as i can tell. i go outside at night all the time to look at the night sky, i like to look for satellites and well just look at the sky ... i have seen lots and lots of satellites before, this was not one!!!!!! i have seen other things before too but you have to call me to talk about those,they are nothing big... but i'm still trying to figure it out, and till im sure it not something man made.... then i will type it out but i could use some help to figure it out so please give me a call thank you s.d."],"Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Sutter Creek","Log Number":"US-05232009-0014","Longitude":"-120.802436","Date of the Event":"05/22/2009 10:55 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.392968,+-120.802436(17089)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17089) map </A>","Region":"California"}
