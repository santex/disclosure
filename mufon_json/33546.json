We were on lawn chairs in the driveway facing East. I noticed in the clear sky about 45 degrees above the horizon a light that first looked like a bright star. Within 3 or 4 seconds it increased with intensity and then vanished. It did not move from its spot but looked like it simply disappeared. About 15 minutes later it reappeard in about the same spot. This time after about 5 seconds it increased in intensity and then became \"hollow\" in the middle like a tire or doughnut shape. It continued to slowly increase in brightness for about 3 more seconds before looking like it \"melted\" or something. I cant even describe it well. Almost like its shape got pulled but kind of slowly enough to see it happening.When its shape changed it looked more yellow than white. Then it disappeard and that was it."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Longitude":"-82.479921","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33546.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/31/2011 07:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Date Submitted":"11/22/2011 10:26 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.269104,+-82.479921(33546)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33546) map </A>","Case Number":"33546","Country":"United States"}
