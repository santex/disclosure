We told him to be watching for moving stars because those are Satellites. We saw a couple of satellites moving north to south, then we saw one moving diagonally from southwest to northeast. Haven't seen that before. As I stared straight up all of a sudden a very bright star appeared where there had not been one just to disapear in an instant. Like a Super Nova from a distant galaxy. I felt assume like I had just witnessed a Super Nova. My wife and grandson did not see it."]}
