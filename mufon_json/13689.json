{"Log Number":"US-11132008-0005","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Iowa","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was traveling southbound on I35 about five miles outside of Des Moines. When I saw flashing lights in the sky. At first I thought it was a helicopter, but the closer I got to the object the more clear it became to me and my cousin that it was not a aircraft that we have ever seen. I know aircraft having served seven years in the Us Army and having a brother that flies Apache Helicopters. Above the Northbound lane hovering maybe 75 to 100 feet above the tree line was a triangle shaped craft with white lights at 3 points of the triangle with red lights scatering the bottom of the craft. In the center was a big white light that resembled a spot light. The lights all flashed in a completely random fashion. After hovering for a few minutes the craft turned vertical and began to fly west at a high rate of speed. My cousin tried to snap a picture with his cell phone but by the time he got the camera up the object was already several miles away. I have never seen anything like it before and the vision is seared into my mind."],"Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-93.602806","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Des Moines","There were no other sightings in Des Moines on or around November 9th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13689.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13689.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"11/09/2008 07:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/09/2008 07:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Des Moines","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Case Number":"13689","Latitude":"41.610205","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.610205,+-93.602806(13689)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13689) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Triangle Ufo over Interstate"}
