Too many commercial lights to see stars. I don't know if there were clouds in the sky. I stepped from my car and looked directly overhead at the slowly drifting object...an object whose form I could only seduce from the outline of non blinking white lights. It seemed huge and to cover a large section of sky9football field size or larger if altidude was as I thought it to be. The lights were what you would expect to see of a house hold bulb at a 500 foot distance. No one else seemed to see it. I got back into my car and continued home. I can't account for my calm behavior and do not believe I experienced any 'lost time'. Whatever it ras it was huge and moved silently. I don't recall seeing the overall extent of its size. I now keep my eyes more on the night sky but have never seen any unusual site since. Chris Cooper"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
