It was approximately a mile away and it was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. It was light in the area due to the neighborhood and city lights. Therefore, I feel the light had to be unusually bright. Not a star but something much brighter. I was shocked and wondered wat it could be. I have lived in AZ all my life and neverhave seen anything like this."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/22/2013 02:27 UTC","Case Number":"50975","Longitude":"-112.03383","Region":"Arizona","Latitude":"33.644711"}
