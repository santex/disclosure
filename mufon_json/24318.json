Very close encounter due to craft hovering right above the tree line.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","divs":["sighting detailsname: [cms\\tg\\pid], age: 17, first afo(alien flying object) encounter. i was a good hour away from home, i was walking down the dean bridge. dean in general is covered by forrest, so as i was walking the bridge there was forrest on both sides of me. the tree lines of the forrest left middle viewing of the night sky. so i could see the moon and some stars, very pretty. but the trees wouldn't allow me to see the left or right side of the night sky. the bridge slants to the right side, so it was kinda hard to walk on it, espicially all the cars zooming by so fast. as im walking i look down on the floor and notice all the trash on the bridge. thats when i hear a strange sound panning into my right ear. the sound gets louder and louder. a description of the sound is hard to describe, but here it goes....deffinately loud and i started to notice a rythem to the sound, it sounded very swooshy going back and fourth, before the craft came into sight i could tell that the sound it made was that of a very large scanning\\radar device scanning planet earth, earth as in the dean forrest where i happen to be walking by. so while im still walking and hear it i look up to see what it is. then the giant hover craft slowly hovers into view, at first i saw the middle diamond triangle point. instantly i knew this was not a plane of any sort, it wasnt shaped like a plane, deffinately did not sound like any plane engine and no air plane flys so close to trees, electrical poles and even nearby stores and houses. the alien hover craft now takes up more than half the night sky. im walking forward while looking straight up at the sky, it got to the point were i could not see no such thing as night sky, only the massive size of this hover craft. so everything around became much more darker with no moon light. sense the hover craft afirst appeared it had some what random flashing lights in differant order and differant color. the random colors inclueded red, white, green and yellow lights. the lights were located in differant spots, it felt like the lights would chose were to flash, so they never really flashed in the same spot, either changing possition or change of color in the selected possition. the loud scanning\\radar sound could still be heard. as it covered the night sky i felt a somewhat change in temperture, the heat around me elevated, like a mass amount of radiation being emitted from either the lights, or the hover craft technology being used. around this time i got another feeling as if time was slowling down for me making the sighting more meaningfull. this is around the time that one of the drivers see me, some random guy looking straight up at the sky, not even looking at the road. my guess is that the drivers didnt see the craft at all, cause it was too much above them. most had there windows up, if they had them down then im sure they coulda heard the futuristic radar device emitting from the hover craft. so when one of the cars honk a few times to get my attention, i wake up from the slown down trance that occured when the large craft body blocked the night sky view. i look back up at the sky and the diamond shaped hover craft is still there slowly hovering, making the same sounds and the same random order of flashing lights. at this moment i am beyond amazed like this was a life changing moment that i had been waiting for, reason being, my father is also a ufo fanatic and believes cause he too has had a couple ufo sightings, strange thing is that he too saw and encountered his first alien space craft when he was 17 in puerto rico. back too the diamond shaped craft. it was a mixture of both a diamond and a triangle, instead of a diamond back end being a mirror image of the front side, the back side was closed of and reconnected like that of a triangle. for the split seconds that the lights would shut off, thats when the craft hovered over the moonlight, so that would let me see the shadow, shape and color of the craft. the hover craft was deffinately dark grey to black in color, looked very sleek in design, it like that of a very futuristic science fiction movie, i too felt like for the first time in my life i was experiencing a sci-fi movie. even more amazed than before the hover craft slowly started to move past the dean trees so i could now see the back section of the craft with two points sticking out and reconnecting at the back. now the night sky and moonlight slowly came back into view. the craft kept on passing in its direction going over the tree line, and this whole time the craft was feets away from the tallest trees, which meant the craft was too close, this is deffinately a very close range encounter, and at such close range gave me the opportunity to really examine the craft and get full details on it. by this time i reached the road again so no more bridge. now only 25 percent of the craft could be seen, but the loud noise it made dimmed down as it got further from me. i can still hear te hovering, then it hovers pass the tree line, becoming out of sight, but for the next 30-50 seconds i could still hear the rythmic scanning device and the sound of hovering. it is now gone completely but still hovering in the area, i wish i coulda tooken a picture but i was too amazed, so the picture that will be posted on this, is a photo from another ufo sight of triangular crafts to give an example of its appearence. from what i know there was no missing gaps of time, like the betty and barnie hill case, so i wasnt abuducted, but i know that it deffinately noticed me. and its odd cause that was the night that i basicly ran away from my house and didnt come home for hours, and came home around 2 in the morning. my walk back was mesmorising. this was pretty much my perfect description of my first ufo\\afo encounter. till this day, when ever im outside, i keep a constant look at the sky, day or night time, im searching and waiting for the ufo to hover by, theyve all been planes sense but i can tell the differance. its funny cause the next morning i tottaly forgot that i saw the hover craft, later in the day i remembered again and started to tell family and friends, ive told the story a good amount of times now. well thats it, i guess email me on what you think, or any questions."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24318.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24318_submitter_file1__DiamondShapedCraft.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24318.html"],"Date
