At first sight, it just looked like fireworks. There were about 50-75 spherical objects flying around each other in the sky. They were completely silent. They would swarm in and out of each other, and then they made a formation that looked like a bow tie. They stayed in the formation of a bow tie for about 15 seconds, and then they swarmed in and out of each other again. While they were flying around each other, they were slowly making their way northwest. They were very agile, and they were having no trouble cutting in any direction instantly. Eventually they stopped moving northwest, and they just started to slowly go higher up, until we couldn't see them anymore."],"Log Number":"US-03252008-0002","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.241495","Date Submitted":"03/23/2008 07:15 UTC","Summary":"50-75 UFOs swarming overhead","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"10037","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lansdale","There were no other sightings in Lansdale on or around March 23rd 2008"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/23/2008 07:15 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Lansdale","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10037.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10037.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10037.html"],"Tags":"City"}
