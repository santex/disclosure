He was in his front yard and looked up to see a large V formation of 5 lights materialize as he watched, at an estimated altitude of 8-10,000 feet. He than described seeing a series of orange lights converge on the triangle formation from various directions, followed by the object fading out. He estimates the total time for the event at about 12 seconds from beginning to end. Later in the evening he again went outside hoping to see the object again, but instead, after a few minutes, he saw a red disc-shaped object flying from east to west in a high arc with a fighter jet tailing it before both were out of his field of vision. The Skype line failed twice during our conversation, and I wasn't able to get his phone number (displayed as \"undisclosed). Hopefully he'll call back with his contact info."],"City":"Scottsdale","Log Number":"US-08172009-0013","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.49647,+-111.916152(18717)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18717) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Narrative below was based submitted by MUFON Dispatch for witness based on phone conversation with witness.","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.49647"}
