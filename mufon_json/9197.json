One evening in 1985 ( give or take a year ) my brother was walking to a nearby store, he then saw some people looking above their heads, he then spotted a gigantic dense black triangular shape in the dark evening sky. He told me at the time that he had the impression that it's size was like several football fields across. My brother was an auditor working for the local authority at the time and did not want to report it, but dozens of others did, and the story made the front page of the South Wales Evening Post the following day. His account of the event was that it moved across the sky very slowly in a westerly direction with nothing audible coming from it. We have both been to air-shows in the UK in the seventies and seen the RAF Vulcan bomber in flight, whatever he saw in his own words would have been 50 times the size and silent. The weather was calm and clear that night."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United Kingdom","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.62989,+-3.939686(9197)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9197) map </A>","City":"Swansea","Longitude":"-3.939686","Latitude":"51.62989","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/30/1984 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"GB-01232008-0025","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Swansea","There were no other sightings in Swansea on or around November 30th 1984"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
