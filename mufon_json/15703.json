Directly ahead and a little to our left we saw a line of lights, evenly spaced, but not very bright, heading North. What struck us most was the size of it. There are very few planes flying in our rural area, but this would have been vastly larger than even a commercial plane & much, much lower. It looked to be directly over Dublin and the lights were on for several seconds, then went off, on once more for several seconds, then off again. We never saw them afterwards, and in what daylight there was left we were unable to see the body of any aircraft, only the huge string of lights, but from the first pulse to the second one it was apparent that whatever it is was making a slow, stationary turn towards the West."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"It was a line of lights, moving slowly & would have to have been massive","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
