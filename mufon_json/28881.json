His son said he saw \"a rocket\" at about 6:30 pm. He was driving and unable to look, though. About 15 minutes ago now, my friend was sitting in his hot tub outside and here is his description word for word: \"OK. There is very strange aerial activity over Fairfield, CT right now. Tons of Quiet objects in the air. I am actually a little freaked out. I was outside in the hot tub and feeling very paranoid. I was seeing several lights across the sky, almost like airplane lights or shooting stars, but it wasn't either of those.\" He is sending me a video as we speak, I'll pass it along as soon as I can get it uploaded."],"Case Number":"28881","Log Number":"US-08072011-0076","Region":"Connecticut","Latitude":"41.143786","Longitude":"-73.254512","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Several silent arial objects in air right now","Date Submitted":"08/07/2011 04:00 UTC"}
