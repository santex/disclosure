She chose a spot that was facing west and after settling down a bright object caught my eye. I immediately drew her attention to what I was seeing. At first you would say It was Venus but Venus it not up at that time. The object appeared out of nowhere. We then realized that this was something unusual. Venus is a good gauge as to it's intensity and size. The object then began to pulsate rather quickly going from brighter to quite dim. a blue hue was also present. Finally the object flickered out again to a blue hue becoming a small dull blue color and then disappearing. It was quite amazing considering the event lasted about maybe 30 seconds. The rest of the night was uneventful."],"Region":"Arizona","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"35.231331","Disposition":"IFO"}
