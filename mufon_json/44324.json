I noticed just over the tree line a slow large moving object. It had very bright white and green lights. It appeared the width of the craft was coming toward me. I'd say the lights were about 100 or more feet wide with the green lights interspersed. I stopped my car and watched the object fly over me. It had 3 large circular red lights on the bottom about twice the size of a pitching mound. Each of three lights had a very ornate metal structure covering them which was easy to see the details on the bottom. The red lights weren't glowing at all on the bottom. It seemed like a very heavy object yet it flew over me without a sound, without wind or turbulence of any kind. You could just make out the triangular shape given my vantage point, it was a very dark evening. What impressed me most are the red circles on the bottom. These circles did protrude, kind of like a contact lense but not so extreme."],"Latitude":"39.198032","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Germantown","There were no other sightings in Germantown on or around December 4th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44324.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44324.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-12042012-0012"}
