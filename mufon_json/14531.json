I went into the house to grab my binoculars, and to tell my nephew to come and check this out. We both went outside and observed the object both with our eyes and with the binoculars. Upon detailed inspection of the object we observed it darting around with a swaying light underneath it. It also would disappeaer and reappear at random. It should be mentioned that the mountains are about 10 miles north of where I observed it, the sky was clear with no clouds. At the time of this report the object was still visible, and the distance it would travel, and the speed in which it was travelling would suggest that it wasn't a helicopter."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Rancho Cucamonga","There were no other sightings in Rancho Cucamonga on or around December 25th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14531.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14531.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"34.114429","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"14531","Longitude":"-117.584498","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/25/2008 10:30 UTC","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/25/2008 10:30 UTC","Summary":"Small object, darting around, with swaying light underneath, disapearing and reappearing.","Country":"United States","City":"Rancho Cucamonga"}
