It was a clear night I was intending to use a new starfinding app on my phone when I noticed an unusual formation of lights in the sky. The lights were of a thin rectangular formation, six lights on the perimeter with a brighter light in the center. After watching the lights I realized it was moving across the sky. It first seemed to only be moving in a straight line across the sky, so I assumed it was a satellite then it changed directions and made a 90 degree turn in the sky. Shortly after the turn it was then obscured by clouds."],"Summary":"lights in thin rectangualar ridged formation, moved in straight line across the sky, then changed direction","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Niagara Falls","There were no other sightings in Niagara Falls on or around November 15th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"11/16/2011 10:07 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33377.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33377.html"],"Region":"New York","Latitude":"43.079495","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11162011-0005","Longitude":"-78.983735","Date of the Event":"11/15/2011 11:00 UTC"}
