While driving on Highway 141 South away from Gravois Bluffs about two or three miles, we noticed a floating orb looking orange object at the intersection of Highway 141 and 21. It seemed not to be moving and was very near some fireworks stands. I also like the other poster thought it looked somewhat like a balloon but as we passed under it did not appear to that. It was witnessed by both my wife and three daughters. It was odd I know that."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.440932","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Arnold","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.440932,+-90.376019(24258)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24258) map </A>","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Arnold","There were no other sightings in Arnold on or around July 2nd 2010"],"Case Number":"24258","Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 01:04 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24258.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24258.html"]}
