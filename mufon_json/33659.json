It is foggy tonight, so a bright light in the sky was very noticable. We watched as the light moved across the sky, and then back again. I went inside and told my father what I had seen, and talked him into coming outside to see this object. When we went back outside, it had moved yet again, to almost completely over our house. We tried taking some photos of the object, but it looks like the photos are not very good."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-121.693583","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"Gridley","Date Submitted":"11/28/2011 12:46 UTC","Latitude":"39.363777","Log Number":"US-11282011-0004","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"33659","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.363777,+-121.693583(33659)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33659) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Gridley","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33659.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33659.html"],"Summary":"Light moved abruptly without any sound","Region":"California"}
