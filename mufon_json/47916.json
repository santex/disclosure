It is an orb that is extremely bright, I got to a stationary position behind the trees and you can see it moving through, to me it seems like kids on a joyride and they didn't think I would be using an old vhs recorder. I have sound and it is definitly different. We see stuff all the time out fishing up in the foothills and they seem to be taking energy from the powerlines.My feelings on the subject used to be in the \"wow\" factor but I have gotten used to it, what are you gonna do? If yo want a copy or the original you can see it turns res and disappears. I have not converted it to digital so I cannot browse."],"Date Submitted":"06/06/2013 02:26 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.668559,+-122.271805(47916)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47916) map </A>","Tags":"City","Case Number":"47916","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Orland","There were no other sightings in Orland on or around June 15th 2001"],"Log Number":"US-06062013-0003","Date of the Event":"06/15/2001 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Orland","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.668559","Longitude":"-122.271805","Object Features":"Other","Country":"United States"}
