Not yet to Hopkinsville and a bright blast of light got my attention. Two craft traveling very fast from the south in my direction. They were projecting beams of light to the ground and they were changing colors. These were not helicopters from FT Campbell. They steaked past me then went up and out of sight. During the time my truck radio as well as my CB went into noise like a sizzling. I can't give you information as it would cause a problem with my child custody case. I am a recovering alcohalic you can publish my sighting just dont send e-mail to my business or make any contact with my ex wife. I feel it is important to report these things so others can know about them. Thanks Tom"],"Date of the Event":"08/20/2005 10:45 UTC"}
