I saw a shinney object traveling at great speeddirectly overhead headed west into the sunset. I though at first it was aweather baloon but the air at groud level was calm. I seemed to be dragingsomething attached to the rear or it was fliping something back and forth on therear. It looked like maybe it was up about 15,000 to 20,000 ft. Four or fivetimes faster than the jets that were on path to DFW. May be one of the pilotssaw same. I couldnt see it when I went around the house the sun was in my eyes."]}
