{"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Longitude":"-81.87695","divs":["Sighting DetailsVery odd morning, waiting for the bus I noticed 5-6 chem trails running parallel in-between a clearing of the clouds, rather odd, however, a small Cigar shaped 'object' was stationary, it had a thin smokey trail behind it. Strange because the Cigar was very small and thin, I doubt it was a cloud because all the other clouds where large and bulky. I am not concluding that this was Extraterrestrial but it seems interesting to see Parallel trails and some kind of UFO."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.253222,+-81.87695(33789)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33789) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Brunswick","There were no other sightings in Brunswick on or around December 2nd 2011"],"Date Submitted":"12/03/2011 11:01 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"Ohio","Date of the Event":"12/02/2011 08:14 UTC","Latitude":"41.253222","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33789.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33789.html"],"Log Number":"GB-12032011-0006","Source":"MUFON","City":"Brunswick","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"33789","Summary":"Cigar with Chemtrails","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
