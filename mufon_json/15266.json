It seemed to be twice the size of a hang glider with a black fuzzy appearance. Late Summer 2007, the day was clear and sunny with a few scattered clouds. I would guess if something moved 1000 plus mph, that's how fast it would move at thirty feet above the ground, blink, gone. But without sound? Air rushing? Shock waves? Nothing. Was it in my head? I was just grilling on the patio with daily life on my mind. I wonder about it every now and then, was it my first UFO sighting or some freaky military craft from the air force base or aircraft companies within 50 miles of my house?"],"Latitude":"38.351956","City":"Hillsboro","Date Submitted":"09/15/2007 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.351956,+-97.204472(15266)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15266) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15266.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15266.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
