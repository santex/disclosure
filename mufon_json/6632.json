Noticed object turned to get camera, it was stationary, took picture. The camera is digital so I checked to see if picture took. When I wanted to take another picture the object was gone even tho it was standing still at first sighting. There was no sound or anything that might bring attention the the object. On my computer I enlarged the area of the object and it was a little blury but still I could make out some details maybe from my imagination. That is why I am contacting you.
