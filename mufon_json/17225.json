{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe went outside on our porch overlooking the lake to see if it was raining and we thought we saw a plane. We kept looking and it disappeared behind a cloud, thats when we thought it actually disappeared and thats what caught our attention. So we kept looking. It seemed odd it wasnt moving like a plane would thats what eventually kept our attention. The object came back it was round in the center but without staring hard it looked like a star. It was flashing white and pink in varying frequencies really fast and sometimes slower and it kept zipping up and down. It was facing north, northwest. Then it looked like something either came out off it or fell off eventually it blinked some more getting faster and then it just wasnt there."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Sunrise","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Date of the Event":"05/28/2009 11:40 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.161224,+-80.280066(17225)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17225) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.280066","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Sunrise","There were no other sightings in Sunrise on or around May 28th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Round flashing with pink and white lights.","Case Number":"17225","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"26.161224","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17225.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17225.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Date Submitted":"05/28/2009 11:40 UTC","Log Number":"US-05282009-0028"}
