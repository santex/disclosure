Could see without my glasses, so I put on my glasses and after watching for about 10 minutes, woke my wife to look at it. She dismissed it as a helicopter, but after 10 more minutes of observation, did not appear to get closer or farther away. Aroused wife again. She went outside and confirmed that it is just at treeline, but appears to \"bobble\" and sometimes makes a small circle. Got my 20X80 binoculars-looks like a flashing white light. Now appears to very slowly be going toward the horizon. But is still visable. I am an amateur astronomer and have never seen anything like this."],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.780271,+-96.674485(16578)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16578) map </A>","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Ada","There were no other sightings in Ada on or around April 20th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oklahoma","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.780271","Date of the Event":"04/20/2009 11:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Saturn-like, Star-like","Log Number":"US-04202009-0001","Summary":"Bright red-green-white twinkling planet-like light in NW sky low on horizon.","Tags":"City"}
