Noticed a white faintly glowing object moving almost due north, way up in the sky immediately thought airplane, but it was moving too fast for a jet at that altitude. The object moved behind a cloud after watching for about 10 sec. About 3 seconds later the object reversed course and doubled back going due south, following same path. I watched it for about 15 sec. More and it passed behind clouds. I did not see it again."],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.732652,+-78.850286(39076)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39076) map </A>","Summary":"Whitish object very high moving fast","Latitude":"35.732652","Log Number":"US-06092012-0011","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
