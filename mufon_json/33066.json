I looked up and the TV picture was getting kind of static-y. I went outside and the noise seemed quite loud. It was a rumbling roar kind of noise. I looked around for a while and didn't see anything. I went back inside for a few minutes, and the noise didn't go away. I decided to look for it again and saw a very large object. I couldn't see any details, only the white light. It was moving very slowly in a straight line. It seemed like it couldn't have been that high up. It went along for a while before moving out of sight over the trees. I continued to hear the noise it emitted. The total experience was about 10 minutes long."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/02/2011 05:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-11022011-0007","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:08:00","Disposition":"Unknown"}
