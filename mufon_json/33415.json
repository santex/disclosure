I asked my husband [a Vietnam Veteran] if it was a helicopter. He said\"none that I have ever heard\" Then a bright light lit up the room. I looked out the window and the yard was very bright.

I went back upstairs and looked out the window again,then the light went out abruptly,the noise stopped and it was as if it had never been there.
