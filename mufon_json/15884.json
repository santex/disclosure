It is a very clear night.I saw this bright glowing object above the tree line coming towards me...it was low. I thought at first maybe it was a helicopter but there was no sound, it seemed to be coming towards me, i looked around to see if anyone else was out to see this...no one was, so I quickly ran inside and yelled for my son to come out. I was only gone for about 10 seconds and by the time we got outside,,,,it was gone! But, far,far in the distant sky we saw the faint glow of it with the blinking lights behind it. It disappeared that distance in seconds! I knew at the time, it was nothing I had ever seen before."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
