So I looked up for no real reason and decided to take a few pictures of the blue sky. There wasn't many clouds and very sunny. When I took the pictures I did not see any of these objects. After I got home I loaded the pictures on my computer and zoomed in on them to about 700 to 800 %. What I saw suprised me. There were at least 20 objects in the sky in the picture zoomed at 800% that I did not see with the naked eye. There were no airplanes at the time, and I don't think birds would have been that high up, espically if I had to zoom in 800% to see them in a picture, so you can imagine how high up and far away they must have been. There was no noise or anything strange at all. I put red arrows to show where each object was. I don't know what they are, but there were alot of them."],"Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.899132,+-91.081246(22998)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22998) map </A>","Summary":"Numerous Objects in sky, at least 20 and cannot see with naked eye.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Saturn-like, Sphere, Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/27/2010 10:35 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04272010-0016","Longitude":"-91.081246","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22998.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22998_submitter_file1__Objects11.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22998_submitter_file2__Objects.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22998.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in West Salem","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
