While I was watching the buzzard, the object caught my eye. The object was sivery white and reflective in the sun. At first I thought it was a commercial or military jet. I then realized how large the object was due to how high it was in the sky and its proximity to the clouds. It was a bright sunny day with a few billowy clouds. I have seen many airplanes of all sizes in the air over the city over the course of many years and I have never seen anything like this before. The object was moving very rapidly and in a straight trajectory. I looked for wings or anything that resembled an airplane. It was moving at an incredible speed and left my view within seconds behind the top of the trees. It took a moment for it to sink in as to what I had witnessed."],"Log Number":"US-07242008-0015","Case Number":"11708"}
