It hovered for less than a minute and suddenly shot straight back up the sky out of sight, very rapidly. As soon as I looked over at my friend, she said, \"yeh I saw that too\" We talked about it for what seemed like only 30 minutes and both agreed it was not something we could explain. The last recollection I have of time was 10:45 but my friend said it had to be very late. I checked my cell phone to see what time it was and it was 1:30 am, so I lost track of over two hours leading me to believe that i was abducted."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.287515,+-85.822281(9430)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9430) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cylinder"}
