{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI got home from work, then noticed this orange light which seemed to be at low altitude, because it was cloudy out but the light seemed to be below the clouds. It was moving rather slowly. I took a video of it. At the very beginning of the video you will see the full moon with some clouds in front of it, which gives you a reference to how bright this unknown light was. It didnt make any noise. You can hear several cars drive past. The light began to fade shortly after I started filming it, but I got about a minute of it on film. Earlier in the day I noticed a similar light in approxiamately the same area. It wasn't dark out then, but I didn't take a video of it the first time."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"bright orangish light moving w to e, below clouds, faded out over 1 minute.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/17/2011 03:07 UTC","Country":"Canada","Case Number":"30222","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Sydney","There were no other sightings in Sydney on or around July 17th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"07/17/2011 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-60.188024","Log Number":"CA-07172011-0002","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"Nova Scotia","Sighting Duration":"00:01:11","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30222.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30222.html"],"City":"Sydney","Latitude":"46.14127","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.14127,+-60.188024(30222)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30222) map </A>"}
