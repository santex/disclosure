Then I saw a black dot appear next to one of the airplanes. I stopped jumping rope so that I could get a clearer picture. Then I looked away for a couple of seconds and it was gone. Then I ran inside to tell my Dad and my coach what I had seen, but they did not believe me. So I went back to jump some more and I saw it again. This time I saw it with lights on the bottom of it and it slowly descended until it went out of sight. The next day, my coach sent an email saying that maybe they should not have dismissed my UFO sighting so quickly. There had been many sighting reported about the same time as I had seen it."],"City":"North Richland Hills","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.837095,+-97.225583(8960)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8960) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"01/14/2008 05:55 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01162008-0046","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"8960","Date Submitted":"01/14/2008 05:55 UTC","Longitude":"-97.225583","Source":"MUFON"}
