SW high in sky, then straight down, then straight W..","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting outside my house in my front yard talking on my cell phone about 9:00 PM on Tuesday, Sept 18th. Notice a bright pulsating light changing to red-orange, blue and yellow white about 70 degrees up in the sky in the south-west. It was changing colors about every 5 seconds. Very vibrant colors. It was stationary while I looked at it for about 20 minutes. Looked away and five minutes later looked back and it was tree top level. Watched it for about 10 minutes. It stayed stationary. Looked away and looked back about 5 minutes later and it had moved due west at tree top level. Stayed there for about 10 minutes. Turned red for about a minute and then slowly drifted straight down behind trees and out of site. Though it was a star at first but it was much larger than any stars or planes lights. Several planes went by above it while I was watching."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/23/2012 01:22 UTC","Region":"Arkansas","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"09/11/2012 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Alexander","Case Number":"42754","Log Number":"US-09232012-0004","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-92.566732","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Latitude":"34.669873","Country":"United States"}
