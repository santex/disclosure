My friend was next to me. We stop and chit chat. We are facing some homes to the northwest of us about 100 ft away. Behind the homes is a large hill. From behind the hill ascend a large green orb that looks like a small moon. It hovers for a few seconds and descend in J shape path behind the hill. There was no sound so I knew it was not conventional aircraft. I turned to my friend and ask him, \"Did you see that?\" He affirms with a yes. From that point on I knew that it was not my eyes playing tricks on my. Other people where there but they did not notice it because they were looking the other way and the craft was completely silent. It amazed me how big and close it was."]}
