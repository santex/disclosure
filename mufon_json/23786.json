This was very strange and I have never seen this happen before and we have seen UFO���s before and have done the same thing. What ever people think of this is up to them but the three of us know what we saw and for sure these things appeared to be under control."],"Longitude":"-123.040587","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bodega Bay","There were no other sightings in Bodega Bay on or around June 13th 2010"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"23786","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/13/2010 02:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Summary":"Five objects all coming in at the same place then moving to other places.","Date Submitted":"06/16/2010 11:41 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"38.33708"}
