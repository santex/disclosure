We were talking, normal father son stuff, when I saw a Blue Light above the tree tops. When I looked directly at it, it descended into the forest. At least half a second later I heard a strange but really loud noise. Almost 30 seconds later the fish in the lake behind my old house started jumping out of the water. I went to investigate, while I was at the lake a convoy of RCMP and Canadian Military vehicles drove by and headed toward the nearest road in the direction of sighting. Naturally I felt shocked and surprised that something like this happened.
