I was sitting down in my chair facing the north sky enjoying the night stars as they appeared during the evening and after a few minutes watching several airplanes fly through the sky all of a sudden I saw seven lights in a row fly from the east to the west in about 2 seconds!! These lights seemed to be connected and moving together at the same time. It happened so fast I couldn't believe it. After this event, I did see more airplanes and I timed them during the exact field of visiion and determined what I saw was not a regular airplane. These planes took about twenty to thirty seconds to past thru the same window I saw the UFO. I am a electrical professor and I have had Ten years with the Canadian Air Force so I know the differnece between an airplane and anything else. I live next to an airforce base and I really don't know if there weee any military activites at that time but I seriuosly doubt it. This experience has intrigued me and scared me at the same time. I have always an interest in the possibility in exteristial life but I never thought that I would ever see anything. This sighting has thrown me in a loop. I love the idea ht I believe that there is other life out there but I am also concerned."],"Country":"Canada"}
