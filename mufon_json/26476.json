My wife told me to go see what it was so i got up and walked outside and could see two jets with blinking lights right behind a glowing orb. I thought the object that was glowing was a refueling airplane maybe with no blinking lights but then it just dropped about 300 feet down in 1 second and flew back towards the jets that were chasing it. It flew under them and slowly became dim as it flew west and then disappeared. The two jets then headed east in the direction they were going when they were chasing this glowing orb. I was in shock i ran inside and was yelling to my family i seen a U.F.O. . I could not sleep that night and ever since then i'm always looking up at the sky."]}
