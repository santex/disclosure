Noticed an unusual orange glowing ball hovering over Clear Lake. Watched this for about 3 minutes, making move changes, but no noise whatsoever. Approx. range was a mile and one half. After several direction changes it disappeared. About 30 minutes later, the same object appeared in the same area, but a little further East. We observed it for a couple of minutes.Then it disappeared, like before. This was 10 times bigger than any other aviation light, we have seen in the area. We are used to seeing Coast guard helicopter and various other airplanes at the same altitude. This was definitely strange and different."],"Case Number":"45859","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.062471","City":"League City","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in League City","There were no other sightings in League City on or around February 23rd 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.556625,+-95.062471(45859)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45859) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02242013-0008","Date Submitted":"02/24/2013 02:28 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
