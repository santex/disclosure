Those tiny faded stars start moving in a formation with no sound. About 3 groups of 4 'stars'. Sometimes each group would be in line, sometimes form a triangle and suddenly they all moved like bees in a hive. There was no tail, like meteor shower, and they were very pale light blue, just like small stars. I'm a skeptical person, and I was trying to compare to balloons, but it was dark and no wind, and these things were flying really fast. I don't know what this is, but I hadn't seen anything like that before."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34898.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34898.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
