It was in between two trees. It appeared to be at the same altitude as a helicopter would be at, but it was soundless. The beam then began to stretch toward the ground in a type of glowing fog or mist. The fog gave off a radioactive white glow. The stationary object disappeared with out a trace, but the fog or mist remained for another 5-10 seconds. The fog then faded out. At first I thought it could be some sort of chemical weapon, but then I relized I had seen somthing truely amazing.
