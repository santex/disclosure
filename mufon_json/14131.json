I have seen this before, so I knew what it COULD BE. I went and got my binoculars and looked at it for a long time. Through the binoculars, I saw an object that had red and green lights that seemed to be pulsating around this object. It was mostly stationary, but moved sightly and after awhile went behind some trees. I was still watching it and every now and then I could see it moving behing the trees. My feelings about seeing it was of awe and fear. After watching it for a long time, I went to bed and felt a little uneasy knowing they were out there and wondered if they knew I was watching them. I have seen these things off and on since I was a child."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14131.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14131.html"],"Longitude":"-81.776297","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Orange Park","There were no other sightings in Orange Park on or around October 22nd 2008"],"Tags":"City","City":"Orange Park","Date of the Event":"10/22/2008 02:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Star-like","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"14131","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering","Latitude":"30.126934","Date Submitted":"10/22/2008 02:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
