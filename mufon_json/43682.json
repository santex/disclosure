{"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn Thursday night South of Marshall, TX around 7:05 pm turning off hwy 59 South onto FMRD 1186 we observed a glowing white large oval object in the sky hovering below cloud level..then it ejected a smaller star sized object that flashed different colors then that object moved upward into the sky.. We were in shock after seeing this as we have seen the star like objects in the sky for the past couple of weeks in the night sky. After the star like object descended straight down and then up it continued to flash in different colors at cloud level. The large white glowing object began to move south southeast from it at a slower pace at first.. and then suddenly took off at a fast speed traveling southeast at a low altitude and disappeared out of sight."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"11/03/2012 06:49 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Marshall","There were no other sightings in Marshall on or around November 1st 2012"],"Latitude":"32.530795","Case Number":"43682","Summary":"UFO OBSERVED HOVERING AND THEN A SMALLER STARLIKE UFO EXITED AND FLOATED UPWARD","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Sphere, Star-like","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-94.332467","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.530795,+-94.332467(43682)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43682) map </A>","City":"Marshall","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43682.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43682.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11032012-0010","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/01/2012 07:06 UTC","Region":"Texas"}
