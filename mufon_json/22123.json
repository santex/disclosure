I knew it wasn't anything I'd seen before and while it was visible and falling it almost seemed to slow down. I really don't know what it was, but I told my son I've just witnessed either a UFO or a meteor, alls I know was I was left with a definite unsettled feeling, He gave me a funny look so I shrugged it off and we finished the walk home. I know I watched it till it went behind the apartment building in front of us, thats it thats all there is. But I hope I wasn't the only one to see it!"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"22123"}
