The object appeared in the sky leaving a trace of smole behind it and then disappeared, then, it reappeared this time dropping from the sky sort of like a meteorite except that it zig zagged s it dropped very fast again leaving a trace of smoke behind it and then splashed into the water raising a large amount of water that even scared some on the inhabitants of the samall fisherman village where it happened. A couple of years ago i , myself , alongwith other 10 to 12 eople observed a very large and long shaped cigar object at nigh in the same beach. On the ocassion we figured that the object was at least 2 to 3 kilometers long and very silent. Now, this crash incident happened right in front of us. My personal opinion is that it is still there and it was not like a large metheorite. if you wish you can contact me on the phones i provided above. thank you"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"BR-01062011-0020","Longitude":"-46.975551","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-23.03015,+-46.975551(27287)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27287) map </A>","Region":"SÃ£o Paulo","Case Number":"27287","Date of the Event":"12/12/2010 12:00 UTC"}
