They are both changing colors rapidly. The colors are basically our primary colors. As I am sending in this report, my son is still outside monitoring the objets with his telescope. He is also trying to take a photo with my camera. My son took out the telescope because it is a clear night and we hadn't looked at the stars lately. That is when he noticed the objects. You can see them with the naked eye but they are much clearer through the telescope. My son is still outside watching the objects and he wanted me to go ahead and report what we were seeing. He and I think that they are ufo's. If they are not, we would like to know what they are. They have never been there before."],"Case Number":"21460","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/12/2010 09:24 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
