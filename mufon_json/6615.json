{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsi was leaving a resturant in guntersville al. upon walking to the car i noticed a large object in the air and told my fiance \"look at that big plane\". then i slowly realized it was not a plane,it was moving too slow to be a plane that large and it was totally silent. one of the 1st things that i recognized was not like a plane was the lights. i see planes all the time and they have a red light on one end and a green on the other that flash in turns one at a time. this craft was nothing like that. there were 4 or 5 solid orange lights from the nose straight down the belly of the craft,one more solid orange light near the center and a bright red\\orange light at the middle rear on the bottom. i could see white light flashing at the rear on both corners. these lights flashed at the same time. as the craft flew over me and was going away from me, the white lights were much brighter from the rear and the orange\\red light at the center of the rear was only visible inbetween the flashes of the brighter white lights. we headed home and i was sitting in the back of the car so i continued watching out the window. we were headed north-east towards scottsboro.the craft was still visible to my right. much farther away now but still hanging around in the same general area. again...much too slow to be an aircraft. it was in sight off and on as the landscape allowed on the way home.after we got into heavy trees and hills,i could no longer see the sky line and i lost sight of the object. i watched another craft around one month ago over highway 79 in scottsboro.this was the same road we were traveling last night as i watched the craft.the one a month ago was bright orange\\red strobing.it hovered and moved left to right and stopped.it slowly moved east over lake guntersville and got brighter and dimmer.i saw 3 planes come towards the object from three different directions.once they all got about the same distance from the object,the object vanished.i saw the triangle again tonight upon walking into my house.it was heading west but the white lights that i saw last night on the rear were not there.i could see the orange lights on the bottom and the red\\orange light on the bottom rear was flashing.it was only in sight for maybe 90 seconds.i ran inside and got my mom out to see the craft for about 10 seconds before it went out of sight.i stayed outside for 5 min's afterwards, but never saw it again.my feelings were not new ones. i had experienced a ufo sightning when i was 13 or 14 years old living on sand mountain(al.) there were a lot of sightings on the news at the time in fyffe alabama.me and my family watched that object make awesome high speed bursts and then come to a dead stop.it was never close enough to see the shape but the strobing lights and flight path were something that had me looking up at the sky every since.until a month ago i have never again seen anything that i could say for certain was not a plane.but the object i saw over highway 79 one month ago was very close to what i saw as a teenager. what i saw last night and tonight was the 1st time i have ever seen one close enough to see the shape and detail of the lights.i was not sure if i wanted to report a month ago.i was almost ready to report last night.after i saw it again tonight i thought it was very important that i report this sighting. i am hoping there might be some other reports that will go along with mine for this area in the past month or days.i have waited almost 20 years since my 1st sighting to see another.and now that i have,i find myself reluctant to tell others because of the taunting that i had to endure as a teenager when i was so excited about watching a ufo.but i know what i have seen and i know eye witness accounts are very important to mufon.i so hope you will email me in response to this report.i would like to know if there were other sightings in my area and if the triangle i saw sounds like something others have seen.if possible i am willing to send a drawing of what i saw.thank you....jeremy adams"],"Date Submitted":"03/22/2007 08:30 UTC","Longitude":"-86.294704","Summary":"Left resturant and noticed large,triangle ship above moving silent and slow","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Guntersville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.358147,+-86.294704(6615)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6615) map </A>","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.358147","Region":"Alabama","City":"Guntersville","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6615.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6615.html"],"Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"US-03242007-0002","Date of the Event":"03/22/2007 08:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"6615","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
