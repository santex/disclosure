{"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Nevada","divs":["Sighting DetailsAfter I parked my car I was looking in the southwestern sky to see if I could view the Blue Star Kachina. I spotted the blinking lights which were at a high altitude and noticed that it couldn't be a jet because there was no movement. Then it started darting in all directions, but staying within a specific confined area of the sky. After 10 minutes I got on my home computer hoping to find a Las Vegas MUFON person to contact by phone to report this and have them also witness this. No such local number exists. When I called the toll-free number it directed me to fill this report. I'm going back outside now to see if it's still there.
