I thought it might be a plane fuselage reflecting the sun (which had just set), but it was brighter than any plane I'd seen. I watched it closely and saw no wings or blinking nav lights. There was no sound (though a faint sound probably couldn't be distinguished from nearby traffic noise). I thought it was strange looking compared to the aircraft I've seen, and watched it closely. Afterward we went inside and I checked Wolfram Alpha for planes overhead, it listed two commercial jets and three cessna-type planes near the horizon, but this didn't look like any of those. It didn't get closer to the horizon as it receded (as a plane keeping a consistent altitude will do). It just kept going in a straight line until it faded from view, at about a 70-degree angle in the southwest."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.428511","Summary":"Bright tube-like object flying in straight line","Log Number":"US-09302013-0013","Case Number":"51206","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Norman","There were no other sightings in Norman on or around September 29th 2013"],"City":"Norman","Date of the Event":"09/29/2013 07:20 UTC","Region":"Oklahoma","Latitude":"35.201293","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
