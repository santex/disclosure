From here we just watched for awhile in fascination until it ascended upwards until it was no longer visible. There were no sounds, only the lights that were flashing in a very coordinated fashion. I know Luke Air-Force Base is close-by, but it didnt look or sound like any plane Ive ever seen before, though I dont want to rule anything out. At first we believed it could have been a helicopter, but it didnt have either the shape or the sound, so thats what led us to drive a bit closer to get a better look. Anyways, see for yourself and Id be interested to know what you think."],"Case Number":"36097","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/26/2012 05:57 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Date of the Event":"02/19/2012 07:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around February 19th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02262012-0025","Latitude":"33.450347","Summary":"It just hovered for awhile and then ascended until it was no longer visible.","City":"Phoenix","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36097.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36097.html"]}
