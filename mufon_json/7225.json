Saw the hawk flying against the wind right above me and it was almost stationery, so I decided to take a picture. By the time I got my camera out it had floated away from me, but still managed to snap this shot. I couldn't see the LCD screen in the daylight (it was about noon), so I used the viewfinder to line up the shot. I didn't see the object on the picture until later that day when I uploaded it to my PC. I do remember jets flying around earlier that morning, but at the actual time it was taken it was quiet. I took several shots in a row, but this was the only one that had a \"bonus\" on it. I have printed the photo & shown it to several people, but no one can identify what it is."],"Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Summary":"Taking picture of hawk, didn't see object until I saw picture on PC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7225.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7225_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7225.html"]}
