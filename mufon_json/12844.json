It was still light outside and it was a large triangle shaped. It had no lights on it just large, grey type metal, and very close to the ground, like a low air plane. I didn't know what it was so I just kept staring at it expecting it to disappear because I was imaginaging it. I kept thinking it can't be real because it is so silent. It made no sound at all. It just sat there, it wasn't even hovering, just sitting in the sky. Then after about a minute and a half it took off. It went faster than anything that I have ever seen and it still made no sound. It went much faster than any airplane that I have ever seen. It disappeared over the horizon and I just sat on the ground and stared at where it had disappeared. I sat there until it got dark wondering if it would come back, eventually I went back to the house and no one believed me."],"City":"New Franklin","Date of the Event":"04/30/2004 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12844.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12844.html"],"Log Number":"US-09292008-0015","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-92.737408","Object Features":"None"}
