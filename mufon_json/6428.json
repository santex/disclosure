The year would have been about 1951 or 1952 and the time of year was in the springtime, probably April or May. (Sorry about not being sure, it���s been a long time, about 55 years ago.) It was a beautiful spring day, not a cloud in the sky, lunchtime at school and us kids getting ready to play on the playground equipment. As we were getting ready to play (we had just finished eating our lunch), I happen to notice a small, beautiful, silver, disk-shaped saucer, hovering in the blue sky. As I continued looking at it, I was amazed that the object wasn���t moving and was able to continue hovering in one spot. It was far enough away from us that, to me, it didn���t seem as any kind of threat or intimidating but I did have the distinct feeling that it was just observing us children at school. I pointed this object out to the other kids who also were amazed at it, wondering what it could be. We had never heard of the term ���UFO��� or had never thought of things like that. We always had a teacher who, taking turns, kept an eye on us kids during our lunch period and I approached the teacher and pointed in the area of the sky where the object was. We kids, after watching it for several minutes, got bored watching it and continued to the playground equipment. While we were playing on the swings, I noticed that the teacher I had informed, concerning the UFO was now talking and pointing to the silver disk to another teacher, both now, seeming to be acting quite concerned and nervous, which confused me as I didn���t understand why they would get upset. I had just assumed that the flying object was something our country had developed, as it never occurred to me that it could be from another world. When the dinner bell rang and we had to return to the classroom, I looked back to that section of the sky to see if it was still there and it was gone. We kids discussed the mysterious object for the next several days, never figuring out what it was. The recounting of this experience is the truth to the best of my memory.
