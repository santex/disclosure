{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI looked up and over as I was on my way to work. As I looked up I saw a cigar or disc from the side was white but not reflective and just sitting behind the power lines at first I thought it was a plane. Then after a few seconds I noticed the plane was not moving. I asked the driver to look he said he saw something, and I watched for at least 5 - 6 seconds, when the trees blocked our view we decided to turn around and take a look again. The object was gone. It definately WAS NOT an airplane - there was no wings and it was hovering still."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Fairfax","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/29/2012 10:25 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38612.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38612.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-77.308993","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.842524,+-77.308993(38612)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38612) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Fairfax","There were no other sightings in Fairfax on or around May 29th 2012"],"Region":"Virginia","Summary":"Looked like a cigar or disc from the side was white but not reflective and just sitting behind the power lines","Log Number":"US-05292012-0009","Date Submitted":"05/29/2012 11:02 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder, Disc","Latitude":"38.842524","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"38612"}
