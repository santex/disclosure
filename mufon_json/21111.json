I had my camcorder nearby and decided to film them. After reviewing the footage I noticed a small object briefly move through the left side of the screen. My camcorder was at maximum zoom at the time, so this object was at the same altitude or higher than the aircraft formation. The attached video shows the aircraft contrails and the small flying object. I have reviewed this footage several times and you can see that the object clearly makes a turn to the left. It also appears to pulsate."],"Case Number":"21111","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.00413","Object Shape":"Circle"}
