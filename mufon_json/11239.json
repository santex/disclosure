{"Date Submitted":"06/19/2008 11:20 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI started taking pictures as it got dark and there were orbs in the pictures. Later that night after the moon was full I noticed a very bright light next to the moon. It looked like the same object that I had been seing the last couple of nights. I took over 700 pictures of this object changing shape in front of the moon. There were other objects that did the same thing as this onject in other parts of the sky and I have pictures of them doing the same thing. Changing shaopes like a electric tape worm. The objects were still there at 4:30 AM and probably stayed until daybreak."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.701636,+-97.334605(11239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11239) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11239.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11239.html"],"Latitude":"37.701636","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Other","Longitude":"-97.334605","Log Number":"US-06202008-0005","Date of the Event":"06/19/2008 11:20 UTC","Summary":"Ufo in front of the Moon in Wichita, KS","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Kansas","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Wichita","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"11239","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Wichita","There was one other sighting in Wichita on or around June 19th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
