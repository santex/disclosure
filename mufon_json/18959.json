I always look at the sky for a while . as I was looking up a brite yellow to white orb came out of nowhere right above me moving fron east to west. the sky was crystal clear and there were no lights around, you can really see the stars from here. There were a few very small high level clouds in the sky, I new they were high up because they seemed small compared to the stars. by the way there is o air traffic around here. The orb moved in a easterly direction as I watched. It approach one of these little clouds, past it by what looked like an inch from the ground, and the abruptly turned in a hair pin like move incapable by any aircraft, and went inside this small cloud, and was gone I watched it for a long time asttonished at what I had seen..
