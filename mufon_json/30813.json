{"Summary":"glowing sphere hovering towards my direction ,it paused above .","Region":"Nebraska","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Norfolk","There were 2 other sightings in Norfolk on or around July 20th 2011"],"divs":["sighting detailsi am a truck driver and i was doing a delivery in norfolk ,nebraska on july 20\\2011.around 10pm i was looking for my arrived at final destination,when i started having a difficult time with the address i needed to find.as i was driving on w park ave west bound heading towards hwy 81.i was driving fairly slow,may be 10mph..when i noticed a pulsing bright sphere coming towards my direction.at first i thought it was a helicopter in the nightsky,but very soon i found out the light source was acting very abnormal for it to be a helicopter or a flying low craft airplane.the bright circle of light it had stoped and started pulsating and dimming its own glow,it remind me of a flash light in the dark running out of battery,pulsating on and off but in slow motion.thats when i decided to stop the truck and turn on my flashing hazard lights.there was no traffic out in any direction so i stayed calmed and knowing that i could of grabbed my camara,it was one of those moments when you feel.. if you do! ,,you will miss out on what you are witnessing. i kept staring at it when its started moving slow towards me on the large 18wheeler rig.the glowing sphere got above the left side of the driver side, around 800 to 1000 ft in the sky.i noticed that it had descend from where it previously was , about 2miles down. as it paused above i was able to identify a much closer description of what i was witnessing.the sphere was a mass of yelloish glow with a clearish bubble form.the edge was pulsating a dim glow of soft yellowish gold light and the internal mass ,was a solid moving blur of some alive energy radiant glow of yellow light with some sort of blurry motion .it stayed above my left side ,which was south for around 3 to 4 seconds,there was a guy walking a large pitbull dog, not even aware of what was taking place above nor the dog.in a matter of 3 to 4 seconds the object retrieved back to where it was at first,at a tremendous speed. i felt almost like if it knew someone was paying attention to it,or the blinking lights of the truck had it come down to check on me.for a few seconds it stayed put pulsating on and off... a few more seconds when slowly came back again ,very slow hovering by passing me. the lightsource was floating in a wabbling path motion,it also looked bubble like, clear and jellyish shape by then it continued east with out any noise this whole time.i had my door window down, when i looked out still following it with a firm stare and saw that it had stoped above the information towers about a mile behind me,on the south east side of norfolk.the sphere hover above the towers in the center at an altitude around 100ft above the towers.by then i stare for another 20seconds and notice a redish glow appearing on the bottom of the object,like if it was copying the flashing red lights of the towers or becoming red to fit around the nightsky enviroment. thats when i decided to leave and felt i had seen enough.i end up driving away and finding my dropped place.the next day ,i had to drive south on hwy 81 ,i had to pass right by norfolk airport and did see a military army green truck there and a soldier dressed army cammo.i cant say for sure if that army staff at the airport had anything to do with, what i had seen the previous hrs.the one thing left me thinking was how the glowish sphere came close to were i was , once i had turn on my flashing hazards lights?..and i also noticed on my gps,that the place were the ufo could had come from at first was by the far west of norfolk,which is nebraska national forest and reservoir.this west massive area of land is so large that its spreads out meeting with the unhabit lands of the state of wyoming and the south national grasslands of south dakota.after having this experience, i was left with a need of an explanation ,may be someone else in the area did witness the event... as today the answer to this appears to me that we are just another grain of life in the universe."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30813.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Sphere, Other","Log Number":"US-08112011-0011","City":"Norfolk","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.030469","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/11/2011 05:44 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/20/2011 10:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.030469,+-97.410556(30813)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30813) map </A>","Case Number":"30813","Longitude":"-97.410556","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
