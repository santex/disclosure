It appeared from the west heading east. There was two giant oak trees to the west. It appeared over them and I was in awe. Kinda dumb-founded. As it headed east it was coming to the tree line to the east. So I layed my guitar down and ran to the road on the south and watched it as it slowly floated east. Then all of a sudden, it just turned off. Nothing was there. I tell you that it was shaped as a rectangle. A rectangle of light. All of it and it was silent. I have never seen nothing like it and have never seen nothing like it again. To clear things up.....I took an IQ. test and rated 139, which is a genius level, so I know I am not nuts like some have suggested and laughed about my story. Oh well, I hope that you find this story as fascinating as I always have. sincerely, Larry"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Salem","There were no other sightings in Salem on or around November 30th 1984"],"Latitude":"38.626993","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3886.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3886.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Salem","Date Submitted":"11/30/1984 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Silent Rectangle of Light in the Sky","Region":"Illinois","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"3886","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.626993,+-88.945616(3886)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3886) map </A>"}
