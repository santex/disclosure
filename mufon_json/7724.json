I'm the same guy that reported the Black Triangular near Rt 104 in Princeton a while back. So, I'm here in my bedroom and hear a low rumbling sound. I know the sound from the past sighting. I slip on my clothes and go out. TWO black triangular shaped crafts flew over my property, going back south-east, across Rt 104. When I got out on my porch, they were going across Rt 460 flying back, well, if you go in that direction they were heading, you'd go towards Danville Virginia. Are we being invaded? I never saw any of the black triangular shaped crafts before. I only heard of them. Now, not only did I see one. I've seen two at the same time, flying in formation. It's really weird."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"West Virginia","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7724.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7724.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08202007-0009"}
