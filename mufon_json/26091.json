I am reporting this for her as I can also view it from my home . Nightly a light lower on the horizon appears around 7:30ish and seems to flash vibrantly and for hours. At times it will resemble the flashes that are present when a photo is taken and at other times you can see an orange and red pinpoint of light from it. At times it appears that another light source will orbit or rotate the light . Sometimes it appears that it has morphed into two lights very close together then quickly goes back to the single sparkling light. It will power up very brightly at times and then diminish to a small light the next second. At times it will move quickly in a jerking fashion either up or down or appear to bounce around inside an imaginary box of sorts. Its location appears within the same general area nightly for 3 weeks now . When an attempt was made to photograph it new batteries would go dead and it would not appear through the camera's view finder. Never seems to leave the one particular area of the sky, near the airport and last Friday on a very foggy night it was the only star that was actually viewable in the sky. Seems to be a nightly sighting !"],"Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Quincy","There were no other sightings in Quincy on or around October 5th 2010"],"Longitude":"-91.404873","Latitude":"39.938782","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Flash, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.938782,+-91.404873(26091)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26091) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Past 3 weeks same bright light with flashes of orange,mves radically up and down ,smaller loght rotates it at times.Bright flashes and seems to powers up and dims out.","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10242010-0016","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"09:00:00","Date of the Event":"10/05/2010 07:30 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Quincy","Source":"MUFON"}
