It had 2 contrails. It was moving very fast. The sky was very clear with no clouds. What really caught my attention was the color of this jet. I looked at the jet to get a better view. It was cross shaped . This jet was extremely bright, very shiny ,and pale gold in color. I ran to the door and told my son to come look at it , but just that soon it was already gone and the contrails also had disappeared . The jet was going east. No trace of it at all was left in the sky."],"Date of the Event":"10/26/2013 06:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-10262013-0018","City":"Kentwood","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51852.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51852.html"],"Latitude":"30.911346","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.911346,+-90.653835(51852)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51852) map </A>","Object Features":"Wings","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"51852","Object Shape":"Cross","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Kentwood","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Louisiana","Date Submitted":"10/26/2013 08:57 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
