We were all looking up in the direction because I had a made a point of it and the light reappeared in front of us all in the same position. It then proceeded to turn on and off at random intervals, being on for 2-3 seconds and off for (4-5, 10-15) seconds. then the object moved slowly in our direction almost as if it were just above us 500 ft away. it then stopped and moved back in the same direction. before diss appearing altogether. The reason I chose to report this, all the while this was happening, in front of us in the foreground a distant plane was in full view and had the regulated flashing lights any commercial aircraft would be equipped with. The object in question that we saw, had no indication of possessing running lights, and the light in question came form a single light source."],"Date of the Event":"08/17/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-79.561908","Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bradford West Gwillimbury","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Bradford West Gwillimbury","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"44.120221","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42641.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42641.html"],"Case Number":"42641","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"CA-09182012-0009","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"09/18/2012 01:33 UTC","Region":"Ontario","Summary":"single white light blinked on and off, appeared to move in foreground, then dissapeared after 5 minutes","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
