As we were headed home to the east of us we saw an extremely bright light coming towards us meaing it was traveling west for at the most 10 seconds then it disappeared. about 5 seconds later it reappeared so far east of us again and instantly disappeared. We wanted to retrace our steps and see if that happened again as were headed west it reappeared so far in the east to where i believe was as far as gallup. it would appear bright then dim then have ovals around it and so many different appearances. I still have the chills. What was this. It was so short we never even thought or got the chance to get pictures."],"City":"Albuquerque"}
