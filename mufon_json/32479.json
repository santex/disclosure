{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval","divs":["sighting detailsmy husband and i were enjoying a gorgeous evening on our front porch. it was approx. 7:30pm and just approaching dusk. i had gotten up to go into the house (walking towards the back door up the driveway) when my husband said ���what is that? come look at this��� i turn back around, looked south (our home faces south) and saw a very large and bright orange\\red glowing object. it looked to be heading in a strong north\\west direction on a steady path. i have lived on this same block for 40 years and i am in the path of arriving and departing planes from metro airport. i can tell you that there have been only a couple of times when i���ve seen a plane that low flying in an east or west direction. we continued to stand in awe and must have asked each other five times ���what is that?��� i want to say it looked like something large was on fire(but there were no \"flames\"). its diameter was approx. two to three times the size of our brightest stars. it seemed so very low and i was fully expecting to see what it was. it was not an airplane i know that for sure. the sky was clear and beautiful and there was no wind. i ran inside to get my binoculars and when i came back out it was still in sight. there are a lot of trees so my field of view was becoming limited. i have a powerful pair of binoculars and it is often hard to find objects right away because of this (plus i was nervous). i had to keep taking them down to estimate the position because it was still traveling on its steady path. at one of these times, my husband gasped and said ���it stopped glowing; now it���s black.��� i had only maybe 30 seconds left of viewing and i still couldn���t bring it into view with the binoculars so i just stood there staring at the black object until it left our view. after the fire faded, the object appeared to be a lot higher than i had originally thought. it was so far up there that i could not discern the size or shape of it. did it ascend that fast?? i can't say for sure. the glow was so big and bright it orginally looked really low. it didn't make sense. after the glow went away, the black object did look flat but it was so far up there that it was hard to tell with the naked eye. it was still dusk so it was light enough to know what it was not. it was not a lantern, hot air balloon, or airplane. while glowing, there was nothing attached to the top or bottom, it looked just like a glowing object. aircraft lights are not huge, orange, or glowing. even at this time of day aircraft lights are not even visible yet. wind does not usually carry things westerly as far as i know. i am more than curious as to what this was."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/05/2011 07:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/09/2011 11:32 UTC","Log Number":"US-10092011-0008","Summary":"orange-red glowing","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32479.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32479.html"],"Latitude":"44.322444","Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.322444,+-85.594234(32479)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32479) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[],"Case Number":"32479","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-85.594234"}
