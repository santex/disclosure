Outside my back door i have a pretty good view east over sheffield toward rotherham. I lit my ciggy and looked over sheffield and about 20 degrees above the horizon i saw a bright light hovering probably about 5 miles away. upon further inspection it looked like 2 bright oval objects very close together. I shouted my girlfriend to come and have a look. she came and saw the object for about 10 seconds, then the objects moved to the left, stoped then seemed to zoom off into the cloud behind it."],"Log Number":"GB-10032010-0011","Object Shape":"Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.386179,+-1.462185(25667)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25667) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-1.462185","Date of the Event":"10/03/2010 05:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25667.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25667.html"],"Country":"United Kingdom","City":"Sheffield","Case Number":"25667","Region":"England","Tags":"City"}
