It did not move and it was the brightest light in the sky. We watched it for awhile and I brushed it off as being a star and it was possibly pulsating from distant clouds moving. It was dark so I am not exactly sure if there was any clouds in the distance. I went back inside and my neice said it faded away and was gone. I don't think cloud coverage is a factor anymore, because I can still see stars out in that direction and the clouds obviously would have covered the other stars, as well."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Pleasant Grove","There were no other sightings in Pleasant Grove on or around January 5th 2012"],"Latitude":"40.371835","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
