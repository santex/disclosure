I have seen these before for as long as I can remember... But this night was different. The sun was down and we were going inside when i saw a moving light moving north west over mingus mountain. I pointed it out to my wife and as soon as we were both watching it rapidly started to grow bigger and closer. It got close enough to know it was not a plane but could tell it was a craft.. the object grew in intensity on approach and stopped and hovered for a few seconds then surged with light and rapidly went back the way it came in..... After that I went and got my camera on a tripod and took picks of anything strange... The pics that acDrrriptually caught something were astonishing to say the least...."],"Date Submitted":"06/29/2012 07:31 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Shape":"Cone, Cylinder, Fireball, Square, Rectagular, Triangle, Other","Summary":"small light in distance rapidly approached... looked like a burning fireball. fast as it came it left. sighting lasted aprox 30secs","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Other, Unknown","Log Number":"US-06292012-0010","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Prescott Valley","There were no other sightings in Prescott Valley on or around June 23rd 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-112.324647","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Prescott Valley","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Arizona","Latitude":"34.597731"}
