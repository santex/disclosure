Noticed unually bright white light from SW. It moved in the sky like a satilite but much brighter. As light passed over head. Noticed a dim light trailing bright light. I too moved like a satillite with some separation but traveling at the same pace. as lights passed to NE neither dimmed like a satillite would. Lost visual as they got lower to horizon. Person conclusion: possibly space station but have never see station pass this high in sky for washington. Have only seen it low in southern horizon. side thought maybe Chinese program?"],"Country":"United States"}
