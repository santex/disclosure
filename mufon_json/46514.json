{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"We witnessed a very large triangular shaped object with five lights (no navigational lights) moving from south to north at speeds faster than any military or passanger jet that we know of - at least 100x faster than a jet.","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46514.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46514.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"46514","Date Submitted":"03/31/2013 10:12 UTC","Longitude":"-83.883215","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile checking out the clear view of the stars last night at approximately 10:00 pm (March 30, 2013) we witnessed an unknown, extremely large triangular shaped object with large lights on the bottom of it moving across the sky faster than any F-16, B-52 or passenger jet we've ever seen. At first my husband thought it was a shooting star because of its speed, but immediately saw that it was indeed an aircraft with lights on two distinct sides. We could determine it's size by the lights shining under the aircraft. Although the lights were much dimmer than the stars or a jet, they had a bluish hue that allowed us to see the outline of the aircraft which was definitely a triangle, not a formation of five aircraft. There was no noise, and when a tree blocked our view and we ran to the end of the driveway to get a better view it was gone. At the same time a passenger jet was traveling southeast to west. The jet had its navigational lights on and was much, much lower, slower and much smaller than what we had just witnessed."],"Date of the Event":"03/30/2013 09:53 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Bay City","There were no other sightings in Bay City on or around March 30th 2013"],"Country":"United States","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.600198","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.600198,+-83.883215(46514)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46514) map </A>","City":"Bay City","Log Number":"US-03312013-0019"}
