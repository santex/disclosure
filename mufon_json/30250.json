It made no noise and had no noticeable flashing lights like that of an airplane or any suggestion of flapping like a bird. I felt calm, I wanted to shout for my boyfriend to come and look but I was afraid it would be gone or he would think im silly, so i took a picture. I also saw multiple orbs of light but because of the coming thunderstorm i took them for ball lightning."],"Country":"United States"}
