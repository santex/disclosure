I was looking up at the sky and saw the object come over the edge of the building it was approx 9:26 am. I asked my friend do you see that? What is that? It moved quickly silently and with a perfect flat trajectory. As it moved south it passed over the warehouse across the street. It was still in plain sight after about 10 seconds and then just vanished. It was a semi transparent milky white orb with little flashes of bright silver kind of circling it or flashing near the object. My guess is that it was at about 1800ft and moving at about 250-300 mph. I did not get the gut feeling this was alien. This was some sort of high tech drone. Would have been very hard to see it on a cloudy overcast day."],"Tags":"City"}
