The lights appeared to be moving at a slow rate of speed. My wife, two children and I observed these lights for approximately 5 minutes or more. Several other cars pulled over on the highway in that area as well. The lights slowly faded out of sight one at a time beginning with the one at the tip of the chevron and ending with the last light. I was able to take the picture with my cell phone shortly before the lights started disappearing."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Mayfield","There were no other sightings in Mayfield on or around January 2nd 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Latitude":"36.751124","Object Shape":"Chevron","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.751124,+-88.629755(21357)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21357) map </A>","Longitude":"-88.629755","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/02/2010 06:15 UTC","Case Number":"21357","Summary":"six lights floating in sky between Mayfield and Paducah","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Kentucky","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","City":"Mayfield","Object Features":"None"}
