The brightness fluxuated a bit. It was silently moving due north. Because there was no clouds it hard to judge altitude and size. It sort appeared to be about the size of the box that large shop vac would come in. Our house is on a hill and we able to to track it until it completely disappeared over the northern horizon. The duration of the event was about 3 minutes. I might have though that it was a floating luminairie except that the wind had been coming from the Northwest to the Southeast all day. This unit traveled due north almost as if following a road. Two other people witnessed the event. It happened so fast that we had little time to to have any reaction except surprise."],"Summary":"orange glowing light moving in the sky","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
