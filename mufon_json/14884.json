All of a sudden a white light speeds in directly over my mom and her four friends. Note it is directly about 20 - 35 feet above them. My mom yelled and ran back to her house across the street. Her cousin though had a flashlight and moved it up to see the light. My mom had just reached her house. Unfornetly my mothers cousin never spoke about that night, and to the present day has never mentioned it. To his day my mother still does not know what it was and though she is a debunker of this phenomena she can not explain it other than it was truly an unidentified flying object."],"Case Number":"14884","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.409471","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14884.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14884.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/30/1975 08:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-01112009-0010","Sighting Duration":"00:01:04","Region":"Massachusetts","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Star-like","Disposition":"Hoax","Longitude":"-71.372867","Date of the Event":"11/30/1975 08:45 UTC"}
