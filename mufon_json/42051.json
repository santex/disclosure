I went to investigate their car pulled over, and what they were doing. I assumed they were looking at the moon, so went to go look. 4 fireballs were in the sky, above where i assume lake Ontario, Hamilton area to be? 2 of the objects moved towards the Toronto area; both at different speeds , eventually catching up together and dissapearing at the same time. the other 2 hovered for a bit, appearing to be comets or some sort of burning up star far away. The two objects proceeded to come towards , then over us, slowly fading off at different speeds in what i guess to be Milton. There was no sound from any of the objects, where there were aircraft; which we could hear, (they did not appear to notice the objects)"],"Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"42051","Sighting Duration":"00:04:11","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42051.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42051.html"],"City":"Oakville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.491291,+-79.692978(42051)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42051) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/26/2012 11:10 UTC","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Star-like, Unknown","Latitude":"43.491291"}
