I looked up and I saw a very bright star like object dropping from the zenith toward the horizon. much slower than a meteor. but with a bright and steady, slightly orangish-white light unlike any plane. it was a straight path. there was no sound from it. it slowed as it approached the horizon. though that may have been due to a perceptive and distance effect and then is was lost from my view behind structures. around a minute for the whole event. it looked like a falling star but lasted so long."],"Summary":"descending fireball or slowest meteor","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.732734,+-121.834906(36662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36662) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-121.834906","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Chico","There were no other sightings in Chico on or around March 1st 2012"],"Date of the Event":"03/01/2012 08:10 UTC"}
