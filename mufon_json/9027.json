(if i had to estimate how far away off the road ahead to the right of me it was, maybe a football field? at first i thought it was a helicopter from the airforce base north of us. but then as it got closer and also since i was moving forward down the road, we were coming to a point of were it was going to be directly over my right side at the rate of speed i was going. i am kinda hunkered down looking out my right windshield and the right passenger window when all of a sudden the lights that had been directly on the side of the aircraft,(sorry i forgot to give total discription) object was disc shape and estimated (this is the hard part to really describe maybe around 150 ft. wide, ) anyway the lights that had been directly on the side pointing towards the road, and it by the way is still over pasture land, heading towards the road,slowly. the lights just like all of a sudden point to the ground, either they were directed from the sides of the object or other ones were turned on and the side ones off, i have no idea. but at split second the ground became daylight. and i mean daylight. i could see the mesquite trees just like the sun was on them. that is when i became unbelievably scared. even while i am writing this i can still feel the tightening in my chest. and this is the first time i have ever written this down. at that moment when the lights came down, i reached over and just rolled down the window just a few inches to listen, my mind i can only remember it was racing do i hear something? i wanted to hear the helicopter noise, and i didn't hear a thing, just the wind noise of the car going down the road. i am heading for the shallow long dip in the road and all i can think is stupidly by the time i reach that dip it will be over my car and it will see me, how stupid is that...it could see my anyway because of my lights...i just kept thinking the lights will hit right on top of my car , do i stop or do i go faster to get past that part of the road so it lights won't be right on top of me. at the time this was all i could think, it sounds so stupid, but that was what i could only think. so i floored it. i buried the speedometer. the next think i remember is looking back in my review and seeing the objects lights hit the road were i had been and making it just like daylight. i did not slow down and kept watching in my review and side view until it was off the road into the other side of pasture some several yards then the lights went off. i was approx. less than 5 miles from my home. i remember beating on the front door, my mother answered. i was extremely upset, my mother can attest to the way i was. i am still very unclear about the after i got home part, but the occurence of this has been with me for years, i have told very few about it. my mother called the airforce base the next day and asked about any manuevers that were going on,etc. etc. they said there were none. anyway i know what i saw and what happened so close to me was nothing that i have seen again except on other pictures of sightings from other people on t.v. or paper. there is also something that has disturbed me and also my mom. i don't like to think about this part at all. it was a little before 11:00 when this happened, and i was about 7 miles out from home. my mother swears it was after 12:00 midnight when i was beating on the door. that really bothers me. there are things about me medically i have wondered about, no not weird scars or things like that, but women problems, ammunity, other things that makes me question every once in awhile, i think about but i do not dwell on. i just know i saw the object, and i really hope that is all that happened. thank you for your time, and if you wondered why i decided after all these years to put this out now, i have been following the texas sightings on t.v. and it prompted me to tell my story. feels good to do so, but sitting here typing this i swear my heart is racing, it still makes me very uncomfortable, the fear that was involved with it. thank you again. d\\ in texas"],"Date of the Event":"12/31/1977 12:00 UTC","City":"Henrietta","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"Lights hitting the ground making it look like daylight, all I could think..it's going to be right on top of me...","Case Number":"9027","Date Submitted":"12/31/1977 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-98.195322","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path"}
