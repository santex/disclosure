Then 2 nights later the march22nd 2011 I was outside sky watching I was looking at the big dipper when a faint bluish whitish very distant small glow was moving across the sky, it moved in a eastward direction I watched it for at least 30 secondes before it was so far away I could no longer see it. I have a very clear and open sky to view every night and I am telling you there is something going on in the skies around me.
