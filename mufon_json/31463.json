{"Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-88.23392","Region":"Tennessee","Sighting Duration":"00:02:10","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and I was watching TV and the outside and inside dogs started barking as if someone had pulled into the driveway. I looked outside and no one was there. They continued to go crazy so I looked outside my living room window and see what I thought might be a helicopter.I went out on the front porch and watch this object move slowly across the sky. I tell my son to come outside and see the lights because it is different than anything i have seen before.The lights seem steady with no blinking and it moved around slowly, then it disappears in mid air. There was never a sound and the dogs were barking and looking up at the object.I did not have any reaction to this event. I see helicopters and airplanes a lot and this was not any of them.I did't get to take a picture or video but this is not the first time i have seen strange objects in the air."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"3 to 4 lights moving slowly, slightly changing directions, then disappeared in mid air.","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Savannah","There were no other sightings in Savannah on or around September 2nd 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31463.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31463.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/02/2011 07:00 UTC","Latitude":"35.205954","Log Number":"US-09022011-0056","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"31463","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.205954,+-88.23392(31463)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31463) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","Date Submitted":"09/02/2011 11:47 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Savannah","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
