{"Log Number":"US-02282008-0019","divs":["Sighting Detailsmy wife and i were watching TV my kids and their friends came inside to tell us something was falling in the sky. From first glimpse it appeared to look like and airplanes trail but we kept watching it and it was not moving forward nor up but straight down, a puff of smoke appeared as if it blew up and below that puff of smoke it appeared to still be falling until it just desintegrated. the neighbors did get this recorded but not the puff just the first part of the falling trail. I ran inside to call fox 4 news to see if it was the satellite being shot down and they told me that had been post poned a few hours and nothing came across the wire that the satellite was show down yet. I didn't take this anyfurther but it is bothering me. Have there been any reports of this incident or has anyone else possibly claimed to have seen this?"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"02/21/2008 05:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Fort Worth","Latitude":"32.734139","Case Number":"9759","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were 2 other sightings in Fort Worth on or around February 21st 2008"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9759.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9759.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/21/2008 05:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Summary":"A ball of smoke falling from the sky then it looked like it exploded then started falling again","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-97.31687","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.734139,+-97.31687(9759)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9759) map </A>"}
