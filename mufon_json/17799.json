There was no noise, except for many fireworks, and I thought they were heading south toward Long Island but they were already a good distance away and it was hard to judge their direction as they disappeared behind cloud cover. Later, neighbors that were at the beach down the street told me that they saw at least 3 lights at one time close together and it seemed there were more scattered around a large area of the sky that were not always visible. They also thought the lights were heading west along the coast. No one, including myself, thought they were going very fast. I'm not convinced that it wasn't a group of balloonists, but I can't imagine that many balloonists fly at night. In addition, there seems to be similar reports later the same night to the west in PA."],"Case Number":"17799","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in West Haven","There were no other sightings in West Haven on or around July 4th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.279593,+-72.941257(17799)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17799) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Glowing orange lights following CT shore toward the west.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.279593","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"West Haven","Log Number":"US-07052009-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17799.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17799.html"],"Longitude":"-72.941257"}
