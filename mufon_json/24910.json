I turned the corner and had a clear view of the sky and saw a huge triangle with lights moving very slowly. I didn't hear any sound. I continued driving while looking up and couldn't believe that I was actually seeing this. The thing was very very big. I drove and turned around to go back with the intention of parking to watch it, but when I returned only moments later, it was gone. I drove around looking for it, but couldn't find it again."],"Case Number":"24910","trends":["there have been no other sightings in levittown\\fairless hill","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-74.851006","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
