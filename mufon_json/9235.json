The object did not have any normal beacon lights that planes normally have, but pulsated steadily. The object appeared to move slowly. Then made a sudden 90 degree shift in motion to the west followed shortly thereafter by a sudden diagonal move to the northeast. The object then began a holding pattern of moving in the shape of a cross, small circles and wavy patterns. There was no wind and so I was able to use the tree in the backyard as a reference point for its movement. It's movement could be detected as it crossed behind several branches in the various patterns stated above."],"Log Number":"US-01252008-0005","Date Submitted":"01/25/2008 12:00 UTC","City":"Arvada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9235.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9235.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-105.080124","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"9235","Summary":"Object moving north out of the southern sky, just to the east of Orion","Object Features":"Unknown"}
