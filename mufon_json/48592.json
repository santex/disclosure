Around 11p.m. I desided to get out of the tub and head to the pool. Apon getting out of the tub i scanned the sky admiring the stars and beautiful night sky. Looking to the south just over the tree line a formation of three bright lites moved in a very wide triagle formation from south to north. I said outloud \"what the hell is that\" and directed my companions eyes to the lights. Only the female of our couple found them in the sky and also witnesed the lites moving south to north. After viewing for a few seconds the the lites still in a perfect triagle formation and still traveling northward started to fade and dissapeared. I scanned the sky for a few minutes but was unable locate the formation again."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.177102,+-122.380009(48592)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48592) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"Three bright lights in a large triangle formation moving south to north","Longitude":"-122.380009","Latitude":"49.177102","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in mission","There were no other sightings in mission on or around June 30th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48592.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48592.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"mission","Log Number":"CA-07042013-0004"}
