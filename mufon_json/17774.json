Boomerang-shaped, all white. tips were thinner than the middle. no sound and nothing like i had ever seen. this was the same summer as my other report of a different object, though this was completely different. it left my sight very fast. i was scared, but it seemed to be flying towards the sky but not straight up, so i felt like if it was an alien, it was leaving."],"Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Region":"Washington","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-07032009-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17774.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17774_submitter_file1__sightings.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17774.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.223104,+-123.094867(17774)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17774) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"Shelton","Date Submitted":"08/01/2004 11:00 UTC"}
