About 18 too 20 glowing balls of light in a v formation with many of them moving back and forth in a mechanical motion. As they got almost over our house they turned too the east in a slow turn and went behind our roof, my guess would be they were going at least 400 mph and 10,000 feet as compared too the jets that fly over."],"Country":"United States"}
