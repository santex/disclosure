{"Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was visiting a friend in Rancho Cordova during the week of July 10-13, sitting in his backyard drinking a cup of coffee & smoking a cigarette about 4 am, when I saw this large oval object glowing like the moon, with flames coming straight up from underneath it desending like a plane landing. It did not make any noise. It dissapeared behind some trees. I listened for an explosion but none came. This whole thing lasted about six (6) seconds or less. That thing has been burned in my brain every since. I have only told my wife of this before now."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Egg, Fireball, Oval","Log Number":"US-10142012-0006","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.596562,+-121.292748(43234)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43234) map </A>","City":"Rancho Cordova","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Rancho Cordova","There were no other sightings in Rancho Cordova on or around July 11th 2012"],"Case Number":"43234","Summary":"Large glowing oval with flames going straight up from bottom.
