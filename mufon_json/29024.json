I held the camera in my left hand and started to take some shots. The camera I was using was a nikon coolpix L110 brand new just got it for Christmas 2010. I took 20 pics within 3-10secs due to my camera havin a option called quick shot it allows you to just hold down the shoot button and it will keep shaping shots in till you release the button. After that was done we hang out at the top of the trail for another 20 or so mins then started back down the hiking trail it was not till I got home to load my pics to my iPad I noticed something odd in one of the pics. We stayed at the top of the hiking trail for about 30 mins during that time we never heard a sound from any aircraft or saw anything in the sky."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05092011-0010","Date Submitted":"05/09/2011 01:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"29024","Longitude":"-122.015615","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
