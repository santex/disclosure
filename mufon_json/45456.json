During editing I observed a UFO in three segments of the footage. Only two are in this video. The third was a cloaked UFO which I will dedicate to a seperate video. The UFO in this footage does not appear to be a solid or metalic like object. It appears to be almost transparent. There is a object there, made of some type of material. See the 3D image using the Sony Bump Effect. Opinions and Conclusions: Over the past two years I have seen, videoed and taken photos of similiar UFO's. The majority of my sightings have been associated with the documentation of chemtrails and chemcloud formations. There are numerous opinions as to what these are. My opinion is either military craft, entities, supernatural beings, possibly from the demonic realm. There seems to be a connection to chemtrails but what that connection is I do not know."]}
