I was at a nearby neighbors house with some friends. We were out in the backyard. We were grilling barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks on the outdoor grills out in the backyard. We looked up and saw 3 circle UFOS. They had on the inside of the bottom red, yellow, and green lights then red, yellow, and purple lights then they were a roquefort blue (what I mean by a roquefort blue the lights on the inside of the bottom looked like roquefort and blue cheese salad dressing) they were still roquefort blue then on the inside of the bottom they had red and orange lights mainly red lights then again red, yellow, and green lights and emitted orange beams. Then 3 triangler UFOS showed up they were purple lighted with red dots on the corner then yellow lighted with red dots on the corner. Then as we were still grilling our food barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, steaks on the outdoor grills out in the backyard the 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom had red, yellow, and green lights then red, yellow, and purple lights then one of the circle UFOS had red, yellow, and green lights the other circle UFO had red, yellow, and purple lights the other circle UFO had red, yellow, and pink lights thats what they had on the inside of the bottom. And all 3 triangler UFOS were roquefort blue with red dots on the corners. They the 3 circle UFOS and the 3 triangler UFOS all hovered over the treetops then all 3 circle UFOS had on the inside of the bottom red, yellow and orange lights then red, yellow, and pink lights then all 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom had all blue lights. Then all 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom had red and orange lights mainly red lights then all 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom had red, yellow, and green lights then red, yellow, and purple lights then again red, yellow, and green lights and the 3 triangler UFOS were pink lighted with red dots on the corners then yellow lighted with red dots on the corners. Then all 6 UFOS the 3 circle UFOS and the triangler UFOS were all white lighted the 3 circle UFOS on the inside of the bottom were all white lighted and the 3 triangler UFOS were all white lighted with no dots on the corners and they disappeared and we didn't see them no more they were going towards the ocean to folley beach I guess they crashed out in the ocean. We saw all of this as we were grilling barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks on the outdoor grills out in the backyard. Then 2 huge cone UFOS showed up they were red on the top and yellow on the bottom then red on top and purple on the bottom they disappeard as fast as they came. And then 3 more triangler UFOS showed up they were yellow lighted with green dots on the corners and made a whistling sound and they were gone as fast as they came. Then 2 blue diamond UFOS showed up and 5 rectangler UFOS showed up they were red and blue lighted. Then a huge chest UFO showed up it was red, yellow, green, purple, blue, orange, roquefort blue, pink, white, and black. and all of those UFOS hovered over the backyard as we were grilling our food and they disappeard they were going toward folley beach I guess they crashed out in the ocean. Then we were all done grilling our food the barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, and steaks on the outdoor grills out in the backyard. We saw the UFOS we saw as we were grilling outside. and We took our food of the grills and got ready to eat it. We saw no more UFOS. It was a very clear night outside when we were grilling and saw the UFOS we saw. Me and all my neighbor friends. We just couldn't beilive the UFOS we saw. It was really and exciting experience to see the UFOS we saw while grilling on the outdoor grills and us all being together."],"Sighting Duration":"00:45:00","Country":"United States","Case Number":"12435","Object Shape":"Cone, Circle, Diamond, Square, Rectagular, Triangle"}
