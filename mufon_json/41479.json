I left work which is llocated near 6th & University in Des moines, Iowa at 9PM and drove to the post office at 2nd & University. As I turned into the driveway of the post office, I noticed 3 to 5 orange round lights in the sky. They were hovering in the sky and there was no sound. It was something of out the ordinary to see. There were no ohter cars in the area at the time. I mailed some letters and turned north to leave the post office. I still saw the lights to the north, but this time they formed a triangle shape. I turned to the east and lost sight of them. The sighting was very strange. The lights did not seem to be connected to anything solid and there was no ssound. The lights were in a line and then appeared to be a triangle shape. The sighting made me feel uneasy."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"Observed orange lights."}
