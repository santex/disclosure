The object was towards the horizon in front of me when it came into my view from the right to the left from my perspective. It was above the tree line about 10 houses down the road. It was flashing white with what looked like three lights. It moved at a speed that could have been a plane or helicopter but it was strangely bright. The first thing I thought when I saw it was that it was kinda weird. I tried to keep following it but it was difficult because of trees blocking my view."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like, Other, Unknown","Case Number":"27793","City":"Riverside","Latitude":"33.963189","Region":"California"}
