Commented to another person -- he thought it was a star, NOT! After about 15 minutes, it started to move North slowly and then, very quickly, it flew into the western sky over NJ and out of my range of vision. One or two nights ago, I saw a hovering light close to the NYC skyline. It was not a helicopter as I see many of them. I am very curious as to what it is. Spy satellite? GPS drone? I hope you have an answer!"],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42728.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42728.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/22/2012 04:12 UTC","Summary":"i round light"}
