My dogs ears had perked, and his fur was on end. The cat was standing horrifically at the window, frozen. (Not literally, just really scared)I looked out the window and saw a huge saucer hovering 15 feet in the air. The grass and trees looked like a helicopter was near them. None of the neighbors knew what I was talking about when I told them later. It hovered, spraying bright light over the neighborhood. I could see my street perfectly because of the light. Then I knew I had to record this. So, I grabbed the nearest pen and magazine (not the best choice for writing on)and recorded the time. That was all I needed to record. I would remember the rest for the rest of my life.
