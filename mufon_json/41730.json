The object was larger then a plane and almost looked like a star but was golden in color. at one point, it looked like a triangle but the majority of the time, it looked like lights. The object came down in in a \"J\" sort of shape like it was coming towards me and stopped. It shaked a bit back and forth. I did not stay long enough to see what happened after that because I was with a friend, who was not so interested. It definitely was not a plane or helicopter."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Ocean City","Latitude":"38.343013"}
