Sky was completely clear and deep blue. I looked up to enjoy the view of the sky and saw what appeared to be a silver mylar balloon, almost directly south at about 30-40 degrees from the southern horizon. As I watched, I noticed that the object wasn't moving with the wind, or making the usual flips or spins a balloon that high up would make. It appeared to be spinning, and wasn't moving from its position for the several minutes I was watching it. I turned to point it out to my son and several other people, then turned back to look at it and it was still in the same position. I thought to go home and get the binoculars but the apt. complex had a strict rule about kids under 14 being supervised by their parents. We stayed another 45 minutes or so, with that silver sphere STILL IN THE SAME PLACE, and then went home to change. i came back out soon after to see if the metallic sphere was still in place, but it was gone. No strange feeling or lost time."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oregon","Case Number":"28711","Longitude":"-122.636461","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28711.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28711.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"45.4502","Date Submitted":"04/19/2011 02:06 UTC"}
