Ahead I saw this large white sphere dip below the clouds then change direction while hovering then move back up into the clouds. Event lasted seconds as I came to a stop and watched. I thought at first it was apart of the cloud but it was bright white then moved upward leaving a dark shadow beneath it and I figured it may have been a drone. On a side note I looked out for drivers as I passed and saw a long caravan of trucks with black cloth covers and what looked to be mixed up barcodes all over them go past. And before them oddly enough I saw to be a person with sunglasses and maybe a wig with a alien shaped head and little mouth driving a new subaru suv. I've never seen someone's head to be shaped like this or it was an old lady with smooth pale skin. I still don't believe it but that is what I saw after all."],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"11/01/2012 07:20 UTC","Latitude":"42.326262","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43647.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43647.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
