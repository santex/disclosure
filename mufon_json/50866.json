In the sky from my viewpoint it was larger than an aspirin but smaller than a dime... So much larger than a star or plane lights...and constant glow, not blinking . The bright orange color was very unusual. Then a third one appeared but it seemed more reddish orange. They followed the same path and disappeared out of my view. They were moving slowly but the sighting was less than 2 minutes. I didn't hear any noise and I was thinking if it could be some sort of fireworks but my dog always barks at them and she didn't notice."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50866.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50866.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed"}
