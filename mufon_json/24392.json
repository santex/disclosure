Me and my friend were riding a moped to get to our soccer training in Neubrandenburg. It was the B104 between the villages \"Pragsdorf\" and \"Sponholz\" in Germany. On circa 2 o'clock (not time but direction) we saw a light - maybe comparable with a star in the sky at night. But this light was in move. There is a small military airport in this direction. It seems as it started from that point, but it was too far away to be sure. So the light upraised very very fast... impossible that this could do a helicopter or anything like that. Next, it stopped and was inactive for about 2 seconds. Than it moves very very fast in the same direction we were riding to and up in the sky. This move lasted about 1 to 2 seconds. In this time no known airplane could move so quickly that it is out of range for our eyes. While the ride and again after it, I asked my friend \"have you seen that thing too?\". I know that he said yes, but I don't remember the rest of the conversation."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.567829,+13.277927(24392)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24392) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/10/1999 03:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/10/2010 12:31 UTC","Latitude":"53.567829","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Neubrandenburg","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Neubrandenburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"13.277927","Object Shape":"Flash","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24392.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24392.html"]}
