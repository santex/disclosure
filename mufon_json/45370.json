I had gone to sleep with my bedroom door closed and my television on. I woke up and was watching the television. I noticed that my door was open. I was not afraid but angry. I thought someone opened my door. There's a step outside the doorway. On which I noticed three beings. I wiggled my hands and fingers to rule out sleep paralysis. One of them stepped forward. I shook my head and blinked my eyes. They were still there. The other two proceeded to walk in front of my television. I don't remember anything after that. The beings were short. Their heads slightly large for their bodies. But not by as much as depicted on TV. They walked pretty similar to a human. Again I wasn't afraid although I knew I should've been. This is the last time I saw them. I may have seen them before. Not sure."]}
