{"Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Me and two other friends were on the way to a movie and saw a triangle craft hover in the distance and disapear suddenly","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and two other friends were on our way to a movie in Maine coming from Massachusetts when my friend in the driver's seat noticed the object in the sky. His cousin in the back seat and I drew our attention to the object and watched it until it disappeared. It was in triangle form and had white lights on the outer edges and one blinking red light in the middle bottom part of the craft. We all assumed it was a UFO since we couldn't figure out what kind of craft it could be and my friend is a pilot so he would have known. We were pretty close to the movies and watching the time closely so we have an accurate time that we witnessed this. We just thought it was cool and decided to look on the internet to see if anyone else saw it and ended up finding this website."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Case Number":"38933","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38933.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38933.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Saco","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.500918","Region":"Maine","Date Submitted":"06/07/2012 12:51 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/06/2012 09:43 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-06072012-0004","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.500918,+-70.442829(38933)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38933) map </A>","Longitude":"-70.442829","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Saco","There were no other sightings in Saco on or around June 6th 2012"]}
