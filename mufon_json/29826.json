Recently my family and I have been seeing a very bright star like object that appears to be lower than a normal star looking south. The object changes colors very rapidly and seems to be spinning in place. I took some photographs with my 300 mm nikon d80 digital slr camera. To our amazement, we found out what the object looks like up close when I opened the pictures. I have been seeing reports online where people describe seeing similar lights. The pictures I attached are jpg files but I also have them in original RAW format."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/01/2011 01:04 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Starlike object changing colors"}
