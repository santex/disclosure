When i changed the exposure i started to see these things that should not have been there.I started to take pics of the sky everyday... clouds, sunsets, chemtrails... you name it, and these objects started showing up. When i would look at them closer there are basicly two types, first and most prevelent are orb type, then there are what look like long thin black lines. These objects love to hide in clouds, i have probably over one hundred pics of these things that should not be there. I uploaded a few of these pics and if you download them and play with the settings, wait till you see whats there (amazing). I am a little bummed about them because i just never expected to see all these things in the sky.( Keep on looking up )"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06192012-0019","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/15/2012 12:00 UTC"}
