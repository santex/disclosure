{"divs":["Sighting Details It was a bright cold unusal mild non snowy night. Looking into the western sky at what I thought was a star, and out from behind came another star and it did a \"smily\" or half circle and then went right back into or behind the big white star. It was so very high up that all it looked like was bright stars. Though stars do not move like that, nor do comets. It lasted 1 to 2 minutes. I stood and watched it for a while till I got cold and went inside."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Indiana","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35422.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35422.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Elkhart","There were no other sightings in Elkhart on or around December 19th 2011"],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Latitude":"41.681667","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/02/2012 09:53 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.681667,+-86.063326(35422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35422) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02022012-0019","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/19/2011 09:30 UTC","Summary":"starlike bright white","Longitude":"-86.063326","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"35422","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Elkhart","Country":"United States"}
