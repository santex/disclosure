Didn't think much of it until I read the Brooklyn paper a couple of weeks latter. There was a story about two small boys making a snow fort in the woods who had an encounter with this being that came from a strange craft and chased them threw the woods. When I looked at the dates in the story I knew it was the same day and time I was headed home from Jackson Mi., and saw the thing streak across the sky. People from the UofM came out and interviewed the boys according to the story. One of the boys was found to have slight radiation damage to his eyes. I am sending this too you because I have always wondered what happened to these boys who are now men and what was not in the story that they could tell us about this encounter. Thought you might know something about this. The one news story is the only one I ever saw and the whole thing just kind of faded away.
