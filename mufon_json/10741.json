{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was in my backyard, looking up at the sky. Suddenly, across the sky a round object moved northwest to southeast. it was above the clouds but could be plainly seen. it was not moving at a high rate of speed but it knew where it was going. i don't know how high the clouds were but it was just a touch above them. the object moved in an exact line with no wavering. the sighting lasted less then fifteen seconds. my feelings were that i had just seen a ufo. i went into the house and then came out again. i thought that if i saw one, i might see another one, but that was not to be. I am 63 years of age, this is the first ufo i have ever seen. i would be interested if there are any reports from kalamazoo or points southeast of plainwell that might have seen this object."],"Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"10741","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10741.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10741.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/14/2008 01:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Plainwell","There were no other sightings in Plainwell on or around May 14th 2008"],"Latitude":"42.449636","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05142008-0002","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.449636,+-85.642074(10741)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10741) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/14/2008 01:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-85.642074","Summary":"circle of light, no sound, moving from northwest to southeast, not at a high rate of speed, but with purpose.","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Plainwell"}
