It had a short trail behind it. Almost as if it was a flare. It was in the direction of the nearby naval base. I know it was not a flare because it only lasted about 3 seconds and I have never seen them test flares. I work on the base. It was a bright white light that was pulsating. Time wazoo 10:33 pm on April 2nd 2013. Clear sky's. there were no planes in the sky and it couldn't have been a shooting star because it didn't appear in the upper atmosphere like shooting stars do. My best guess is that it started out about 400-600 feet in the air. It seemed to be about 2-5 miles north east of me. It went down very quickly and went out of my view due to the surrounding trees and buildings. Yay! My first sighting in years!"]}
