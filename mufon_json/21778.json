I noticed a steady, fairly bright light, at first I thought it was a sattelite but it was too low and too slow. I watched it for approx 1 minute before it split into a total of 4 objects. The 3 new objects moved at the same speed, diverged from the primary at equal angles and slowly grew farther apart from the first object seen. This continued for approximatly 1 minute and all 4 lights diappeared spontaneously. They did not speed up, flicker, turn, just were gone, all at the same time. I did not see any navigation lights, hear any engine noises. This is the first time I've ever reported anything. This whole thing was just plain strange. In the past I've worked as a professional pilot and as an air traffic controller, I'm very used to looking at aircraft, this was definitly different."],"Log Number":"US-02052010-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-119.805803","Region":"Nevada"}
