We had just gotten on 215 at Eastern Ave. and were adjusting the the flow of traffic. I glanced up and saw this brilliantly lite UFO. It was not the shape of anything you have on your page. The diamond was the closest to it. I tried to get another better look at the unusual shape. I zerod in on it for about 2 seconds and was just adjusting my eyes when it blinked out. The UFO looked like it had a million lights in it, and the material it was made out of looked like crystal to me."],"Date of the Event":"03/06/2009 02:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"36.120936","Case Number":"16866","Log Number":"US-05112009-0001","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There was one other sighting in Las Vegas on or around March 6th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"03/06/2009 02:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"A brilliantly lite not really diamond shaped but something like it.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Diamond","City":"Las Vegas","Longitude":"-115.163026","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.120936,+-115.163026(16866)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16866) map </A>","Region":"Nevada"}
