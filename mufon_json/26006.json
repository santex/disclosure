{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were standing outside at 6:08 pm in the SW suburb of Chicago called Oak Forest when I noticed to the west 2 bright streaking objects heading West. We both said what are those. I figured they were high flying planes getting some type reflection off the setting sun. Still they looked weird and I grabbed my phone and snapped 2 pictures before they disappeared behind the trees. You can see one object clearly while the second object which is directly below had just started to go behind the tree. I took 2 pictures about 7-8 seconds apart. The sun was setting and the moon was bright but in the eastern sky behind us.Never seen anything like it before. I then witnessed an grayish blue airliner flying low heading south in the same patch of sky as the two objects.Here's the photos for what they're worth."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","City":"Chicago","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around October 20th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"Illinois","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-87.629798","Log Number":"US-10212010-0005","Summary":"Two bright objects heading west at high speed.
