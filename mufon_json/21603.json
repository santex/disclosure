I was looking at the tree line when i noticed two opaque spheres just above the tree line circling one another top to bottom, during a very fast vertical ascent the two objects then split apart and descended very quickly below the tree line and a second or two later they both shot up in a 45 degree angle extremely fast and they were gone. I could tell they were spheres but they were almost see through with a slightly dark center. I am absolutely sure they were not birds or aircraft."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in West Terre Haute","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"01/23/2010 06:33 UTC","Case Number":"21603","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.465036,+-87.450021(21603)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21603) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.465036","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21603.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21603.html"]}
