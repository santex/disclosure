I observed this from Rio Rancho, NM. I first saw it at about 11 pm on the 21st, and thought it was just a bright star. But by 6 am I noticed it had become a lot brighter and could not be a star. It had not moved for over 6 hours. It was also witnessed by two other security officers. We used Google Sky to determine that the only thing close was Mars, but it was way too bright to be Mars. I had work to do and could not continue to observe it."],"Longitude":"-106.657854","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Rio Rancho","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-09232013-0008","Date of the Event":"09/22/2013 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/23/2013 09:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Rio Rancho","There were no other sightings in Rio Rancho on or around September 22nd 2013"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
