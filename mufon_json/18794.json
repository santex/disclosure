It was approximately 06:05 to 06:15, before sunrise. The morning was overcast with low-lying clouds. I saw above me, just at the bottom edge of a low cloud, a green steady light, cigar-shaped with rounded ends. It was a soft, steady light and remained for about 7 secs before disappearing into the cloud. The light did not flash or strobe. To compare with a field of vision, if you hold up a typical pen at arms length, only about half the length of the pen, would equate with the size of the light. It was the shape, color, and non-strobing that caught my eye. I was curious, but not frightened. The Palm Beach airport is near the location. I reported this when it happened to another UFO site, but lost the web address."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"26.722892","Summary":"Green light cigar-shaped but with rounded ends","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida"}
