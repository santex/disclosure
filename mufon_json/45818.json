Thats when I first noticed the red lights in the sky, at first I had thought it was a formation of military jets or some kind of helicopter but then I noticed that two of the three balls of light were orbiting (circling) the third ball of light. I told my brother to look out the window and describe the object to me while I drew it down in a sketchbook. After a quick draw I looked up again just in time to see the object start to drop smaller orbs of light, I remember jokingly saying \"its like a Battle: Los Angeles invasion\" but I wasn't quite sure what to think of it. I remember mostly feeling wonder, also a bit of fear when the objects began to fall from it and my brother may have felt the same thing but we were both very quiet for the whole thing. We lost sight of the object about an hour later when it suddenly disappeared, maybe flying off or maybe teleporting I don't know."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45818.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45818.html"],"Case Number":"45818","Object Features":"Unknown"}
