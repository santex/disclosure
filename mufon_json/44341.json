(south sw) 3)at first i thought its was the spotlight of a low flying news\\police chopper but it was not 4) the large object was just hovering high in the sky, it was super bright above the horizon 50��� from my windshield and again too big to be a star or planet. glowing and almost spinning (again i was driving so i had to keep my eye on the road. thinking to myself \"is anyone else see this thing??\" then as i turned direction heading south i noticed 3 smaller objects at 3 triangle points around this larger ball then they moved in a straight line below the main larger ball. i never in my life seen anything like it. i know this was not a plane because i noticed a plane to the east with the typical blinking green and red lights. then the 3 smaller balls just vanished.......as i turned again heading west i looked to my left (which would be south drivers window) the large ball shaped object was gone. 5)i felt excited and actually shocked on what i witnessed. i was talking out loud yelling i cannot believe what the hell i'm seeing. i really hope someone else seen this. 6) i lost sight either it vanished or line of sight due to trees and buildings."],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Sterling Heights","There were no other sightings in Sterling Heights on or around December 5th 2012"],"Longitude":"-83.022993","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"44341","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Large glowing ball - with 3 smaller balls circling with formation","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.586662,+-83.022993(44341)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44341) map </A>"}
