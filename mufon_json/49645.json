I saw an object flying slow ahead. I noticed that it was silent and the colors of the lights were odd. At first I thought it was a plane but it made a strange 90 degree turn and started flashing brilliant colors. its started to fly south away from me and I unplugged my phone and took footage of the object. It flew up, down, left, right, and even diagonal. I got it all on film. I was very happy to get the footage about 15 minutes of the objects flight patterns and colors. after about 17 minutes from when I spotted it the lights faded out. feel free to contact me I got some great footage you should see. I do not want to just post the film you have to contact me if you want to see it. thanks"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-123.057005","Case Number":"49645","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Cottage Grove","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.803893,+-123.057005(49645)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49645) map </A>","Tags":"City","Region":"Oregon","Log Number":"US-08092013-0020","Object Shape":"Cone, Cylinder, Diamond, Oval, Sphere, Triangle, Other, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49645.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"maney different colors...I HAVE FOOTAGE!!
