{"divs":["Sighting Detailswatched intermitent flashes for approx. 4 min. It did not move during this time. I turned, went into the house, called for my girlfriend to see it. She then viewed the stationary flashes with me for about 2 min. the flashes were erratic and about 5 to 20 seconds apart. Then suddenly we jumped at what i assume was a BRIGHT shooting star above our heads. When we looked back to the spot in the sky where the flashing was comming from, we were shocked to see the flashing had moved approx. 3 inches across the sky toward where the shooting star had just lit up.. that moment went by very quickly. We observed the flashing for another min or so then it just didnt flash anymore. Whatever it was, was too far away to see any shape, but I tell you It was stationary in the sky and reacted to the bright shooting star. I swear this all to be true. -nate btw:We live directly under a very busy skyway along the west coast south of portland so some pilot out there had to see this i would imagine."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Grants Pass","There were no other sightings in Grants Pass on or around December 2nd 2008"],"Region":"Oregon","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"12/02/2008 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.441907,+-123.321422(14201)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14201) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-123.321422","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12032008-0005","Summary":"Stationary with intermitent flashes of white light.","Case Number":"14201","Date of the Event":"12/02/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.441907","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14201.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14201.html"],"City":"Grants Pass","Source":"MUFON"}
