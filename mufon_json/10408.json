A ball-like light dropped from one of the clouds fast and then stayed stationary as it became brighter and more fuzzy while it changed shape at the edges. You could see pieces of the cloud that broke off as it came down. We began to drive toward it and then it just became smaller until it was gone as if it sucked itself inside of a particle with a flash. We were in a sort of trance that might have been because of the driving and thought nothing of it until a few days later. We cannot remember if we were in New Mexico or Texas, but it was near the boarder."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:00","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/30/2005 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"10408","Latitude":"31.76272","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/30/2005 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10408.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10408.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10408.html"],"Longitude":"-106.484051","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04182008-0018","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in El Paso","There were no other sightings in El Paso on or around November 30th 2005"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
