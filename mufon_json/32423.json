Now this object was so low u would hear it if it was an earthly flying object, but no sound especially at its massive size. Right after that all the animals came out and stood on top of a hill at work, weird. Second sighting i happened to still be thinking about the first and was smoking a cigarette at 830am on oct 6 and saw an aircraft with a banner tailing it. I flashed my high intensity flashlight at it to catch attention, i saw the banner disappear quick as 10 seconds after i flashed about 20 aeconds later the aircraft in front disappeared....the sky was clear."],"Date Submitted":"10/07/2011 06:53 UTC","Disposition":"Hoax","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
