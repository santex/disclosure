that usually occurs only with an extremely bright lighting."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"10/20/2011 12:30 UTC","Latitude":"33.452227","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 3 other sightings in Phoenix on or around October 16th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"10/16/2011 06:47 UTC","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-10202011-0002","Longitude":"-112.067737","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32737.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32737_submitter_file1__objecttowardsme.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32737_submitter_file2__objectheadingaway.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32737_submitter_file3__objectheadingawaywithroof.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32737.html"],"City":"Phoenix","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Low and slow star-like object traversing from SW to E, then light instantly disappears after traversing 1 mile distant away from me.","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:05:19","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"32737"}
