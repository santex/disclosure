The first time there was only one of them. They always are going in the same direction. They are amber colored and not very bright. Once, I saw a larger light that split into three lights as they continued traveling together at a high rate of speed. I kept telling my husband about them. He finally saw them too the last time I saw them. On that occasion there were two lights that seemed to join together and split apart several times as they traveled across the sky. There is never any sound associated with these objects and they move too quickly and oddly to be any sort of craft that is known to me."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"01/18/2012 01:39 UTC"}
