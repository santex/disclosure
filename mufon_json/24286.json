{"Latitude":"46.737523","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the evening of July 4, 2010 there were 6 of us on my neighbors pontoon boat hoping to watch fireworks from the middle of the lake when my neighbor who was driving shouted \"what's that?\" as he pointed upward toward the northwest. The object moved from about 45 degrees above the horizon from the NW to SE until we lost it at about 45 degrees above the SE horizon. We all looked and were all speechless momentarily as we tried to analyze what we were seeing. We had seen a satellite earlier that was very typical but this object was many times larger and moving at what appeared to be the same altitude and speed. The size and brilliance, compared to Venus which was visible was about the same brilliance but roughly about 5+ times larger. We all attempted to make guesses at what we had seen but at the speed the object was traveling, none of our guesses seemed to fit what we saw. It moved too fast for some, was too Red for others and was definitely too high for others. To us it was not identifiable."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24286","Longitude":"-94.68232","Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 04:06 UTC","Region":"Minnesota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24286.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24286.html"],"Summary":"Bright red circular s shape with white band around it.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.737523,+-94.68232(24286)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24286) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 09:30 UTC","trends":[],"Log Number":"US-07062010-0037","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO"}
