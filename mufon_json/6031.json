We were camping at the waters edge when we heard a rucus from across the lake, ( at that hour, sound carried well across the water). We went out to investigate and saw a dark cigar shaped object blotting out the stars. We were camping in a bay of the manmade lake (Clark's Hill). This object moved from the north of the bay to the south of the bay without a sound. It was somewhat verified by the exclaimations of the night fishermen across the lake. Noticeable on the craft was a bright red non-flashing light on the north side of the object and an irised open \"spot-light\" at the southern end of it. This light was focused on the water and held steady until it almost reached the opposite side of the bay, it then left quickly upwards at an angle. There was not sound with it at all. This happened quite a few years ago, but is true as best as I can recall the incedent."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.620966,+-82.275123(6031)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6031) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/31/1994 10:00 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pollards Corner","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"Georgia","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.275123","Date of the Event":"08/31/1994 10:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"oblong dark shape against stars above the lake","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar","Case Number":"6031","City":"Pollards Corner","Log Number":"US-12312006-0002"}
