I made sure it was not a bird or airplane. I have heard about these before, but never entered my mine that i would someday see one. I was happy to finally be a witness to see something like this. I told my family about this and we had a good disscusion on this matter. My self and my son are both ex military so we are always looking on our surrondings. You see alot of stuff in the sky, but this one for me is the best sight i have had. I'm glad it happend in 2012."],"City":"Detroit","Date Submitted":"12/19/2012 11:26 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.336425","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"44666","Longitude":"-83.111159","Log Number":"US-12192012-0022","Region":"Michigan","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.336425,+-83.111159(44666)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44666) map </A>","trends":["There have been 56 other sightings in Detroit","There were no other sightings in Detroit on or around November 14th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"it took about 3 seconds to see this"}
