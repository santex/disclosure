It was very warm and crystal clear that night.Ihad my head out the car window chcking out the stars and looking for sattelites,sometimes you can see them moving across the sky.I saw a very bright light that appeared to be a sattelite, it was way up there,but it suddenly came down to an alttitude where commercial airliners fly.But it didn't make any noise at all.It was moving from West to East.Then all of the sudden it stopped cold in mid-air,made a perfect square I would guess to be about 300 to 400 yards square and then proceeded on it's original course.It stayed like this for quite a while and then made a series of zig-zag movements and then it was gone,faster than anything I ever seen flying before."],"Summary":"A single very bright white light.","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"06/11/2008 03:04 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/11/2008 03:04 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"37.641627","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13536.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13536.html"],"Case Number":"13536","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.641627,+-120.993578(13536)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13536) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Modesto","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"None"}
