I first noticed the object thinking it was a helicopter or plane in the close distance. About 5 minutes later i noticed it had not moved, so i started watching it. I noticed it would elevated and glide side to side covering a matter of a mile or so in each direction in a matter of a second. The object was glowing and pulsating . It would blend colors from an orange to golden yellow to a peach color. It zig zagged for about 15 minutes over Mesa Rock mountain until it dropped elevation and descended down smoothly till it was probably 1000 ft about the rock formation. The object then started glowing even brighter, as it bubbled out approx 3 dozen red flickering orbs. These red orbs flickered until they were about half way down to earth, than disappeared. After the orbs stopped coming out the object ascended about 1000ft higher than sat for about 5 minutes. It then went bright then disappeared about 5 or six times till it finally went black."],"Date Submitted":"01/14/2013 11:02 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45209.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45209.html"]}
