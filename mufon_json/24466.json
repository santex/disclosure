As it continued on a steady path toward the north, it seemingly continued through the fireworks display at the ballpark. The object was moving slowly, as if observing the whole fireworks display, and after coming through the area disappeared to my vision. Though it began as individual lights, it appeared after about 10 minutes to glow flaming red. It seemed to be cylindrical in shape, and continued its journey northward until I could see it no more. I jokingly said to my granddaughter, I hope the pilot of that thing didn't catch on fire, going through all those fireworks! At first sighting of the object, I told my family to look at the ufo. They laughed at me, as usual."],"trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Fayetteville","There were no other sightings in Fayetteville on or around July 4th 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24466","Latitude":"36.143578","Date Submitted":"07/12/2010 06:54 UTC","Longitude":"-94.122922","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.143578,+-94.122922(24466)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24466) map </A>","Summary":"UFO sighted over Fayetteville/Springdale, Arkansas area on 4th of July.","City":"Fayetteville","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 08:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
