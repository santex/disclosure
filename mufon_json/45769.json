It was a perfect, equilateral triangle almost twice as big across as the moon. It was made out of red-orange lights about the brightness of average stars - except distinctly red. It started as an equilateral triangle then it turned edge on and dropped down behind some trees. It was visible to me for about a minute or two. I asked my friend Marvin what he saw before calling it to my attention with a phone call. He said that it was definitely not a solid triangular object but three individual lights. Having viewed it longer than I did, Marvin saw the three lights go into a straight line and one light became much brighter that the other two.
