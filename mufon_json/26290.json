We left around 11am local time, and the time-stamp on the photographs says 1:36pm and was set to Central time. While he was driving the car down I40-West, I was taking photographs of the surrounding desert. I'm not exactly sure if we were in Arizona or California when I took those pictures, and I did not see anything myself when I was taking them. When we were going over the photos of the trip on the computer later, I noticed that there was something unusual in them, and my husband suggested that I send the photos in here."],"Log Number":"US-11022010-0007","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/30/2010 01:36 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
