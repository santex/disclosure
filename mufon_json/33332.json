I went outside to have a cigarette, and my grown nephew went outside as well. We had no yard lights on, and it was quite dar. The moon was just coming up, and it was mostly clear. While we were looking up in the sky at two planes flying over, we both saw a flash of light in the sky slightly towards the East. My nephew asked me if he saw it before I could say anything. This is the second time I have seen this flash in the past 4 weeks. It's quicker than lightning, and very localized in the sky. I spend a lot of time looking at the stars at night, but have never seen anything like this before. Personally, I'm glad my nephew was out there, because I would have shrugged this off as.... my eyes playing tricks or something."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.221263","City":"Danielsville","Summary":"Saw a flash of light in the sky","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Georgia","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"11/13/2011 08:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/14/2011 02:12 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
