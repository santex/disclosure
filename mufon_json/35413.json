I was a block east of main street parked on the street when I saw bright lights coming from the west into town. I knew the airports were shutdown during the blizzard and I thought maybe the Mayo One helicopter was trying to do an emergency landing. The object got closer and closer. It looked like it was going to crash near me so I got out of my car to get out of the way. Amazingly there was absolutely no sound. As it came closer I could see through the wind and snow that it was triangular in shape with lights on all 3 corners. The object stopped just on the west side of town a few blocks from me, hovered, and then abruptly turned and headed back west very quickly. I was absolutely stunned and couldn't believe what I had just seen."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"43.84552","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"02/02/2012 12:14 UTC","Date of the Event":"12/14/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Chatfield","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35413.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35413.html"],"Summary":"Sited rectangular-shaped space ship","Longitude":"-92.189052","Log Number":"US-02022012-0009"}
