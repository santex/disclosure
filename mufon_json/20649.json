SDame object as I reported on the 10th, but lighting was different, this wasn't as bright this time but in the same spot in the sky, DIRECTLY straight north. THis time I was prepared with a camera. Object was not a reflection or light aberration of any kind it was very large and seemed to be thousands of feet up. Even though at times the sky was clear, it always seemed to be HAZY or partially cloaked. It went up really high around an hour 30 minutes, then came back down, then disappeared. 15 minutes later it appeared again for another 15 minutes then was gone."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.094529,+-79.080648(20649)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20649) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"20649","Longitude":"-79.080648"}
