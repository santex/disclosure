The second one then turned into a cylinder and was multicolored. I live in the vicinity of Picatinny Arsenal and this is not the first time I saw something like this, they always seem to hover and very brightly, brighter than bright, pulsate. Then in an instant they are gone. No noise. At one point the bigger one on top had another blinking light that seemed to merge with it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Other"}
