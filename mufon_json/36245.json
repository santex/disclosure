Lights changed direction then stationary again. Then they all moved at the same time slowly towards the south. Lights all became bright when stationary then became real dim when moving south. We lost visability due to houses. No sound or anything. There was also a small plane in the sky on west side of us but at a higher altitude. All was seen from the southside near downtown San Antonio. Seen March 3, 2012 around 9:15pm. I put march 3 2011 for date because the report wouldn't allow me to put exact date."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.433442,+-98.484308(36245)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36245) map </A>","Latitude":"29.433442","Date of the Event":"03/03/2011 09:15 UTC","Summary":"Around eight red, orange, pink lights: 2 on top of each other and the rest evenly spaced out.","City":"San Antonio"}
