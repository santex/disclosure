He said two went together from west to east and the third came from a slightly different angle, intercepted, joined the other two, and they all three proceeded until they were out of view. He said he had never seen anything move that fast except a missile. He held up his finger and thumb in an open V-shape and said they were bird-shaped. We were facing east. The moon was low in the sky about 10 o'clock angle and the lights were went over our heads from about 5 o'clock to 1 o'clock. On the way home I asked if they were as bright as the headlights coming toward us. Dad said know, they were neon, white."],"trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around October 26th 2007"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"8227","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8227.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8227.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/26/2007 06:00 UTC","Longitude":"-121.4885","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.587332,+-121.4885(8227)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8227) map </A>","Region":"California","Latitude":"38.587332","City":"Sacramento","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/26/2007 06:00 UTC","Summary":"3 bright, white-neon, bird-shaped lights sped through the sky after dusk in Sacramento, CA"}
