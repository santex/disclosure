</A>","Region":"Washington","divs":["Sighting Detailsi was leaving port orchard heading towards tacoma from sedgewick rd onramp,as soon as i got on the freeway itsself,boom there they were at my 12 oclock low i estimate it at about 1000 feet maximum height from the ground.three bright lights stationary dead ahead.its dark and you have trees on both sides of the freeway.the lights were between the trees dead ahead.at first i thought it was planes coming in for a landing at tacoma narrows munincple airport,but as the freeway keeps winding every mile or so,the trees would block out the object[s]until and at the same time reveal other parts of the sky.when i saw the objects stationary again same intensity of light,[very very bright],you could see off to the right of them,there was a small plane with the red and green lights on each wingtip.also you can see the commercial and or military planes to the left on thier regulur paths to seatac and mccord afb.i dont think they saw it but im 1000% sure the small aircraft did cuz he was very close to the objects.i lost sight of them on the next curve that was blocked by the trees ,also i was speeding towards the direction and i wasnt the only one ,someone in a soccer mom van flew right past me i was doing about 75 they musta been doing 90+ trying to see them again i assume.when it cleared up from the trees of course they were gone but the small plane was doing circles above the farmland down below.my feelings are that theyre here.im mean they are here!this is actually my 4th or 5th sighting ,my second best.it was dark but they were low,stationary,and brightly lit,if it was 1 solid object ,i bs you not it had 2 have been a mile maybe in length.triangle formation of lights i never seen before.ima tell you about the other sightings i had .and fortunatly i had witnesses to my best sighting.mccord afb,summer 2012,a stationary oroange {fireball} i guess best describes it,hard to describe something you dont know,anyways after a couple minutes,it shot out straight to the ground on the military base another but even smaller {fireball] and when it did that ,we rushed the car to get down to mccord afb to see ,but it was gone when we got there.my [family member] was shocked when i called her out because i saw another one about 2 weeks prior to that so ive been skywatching ever since then.i would like to believe theyre ours but the sighting i had prior to the afb one,i was smoking outside no not dope either i saw what looked like 2 satellites side by side ,i thought nothing of it at first but i never seen satelites side by side like that so i kept watching.i still think one was a satelite but the one on the left came to a dead stop,moved to the left,went back to its original stop point,moved to the right about equal distance,went back to its stop point,then it just went bright as hell ,then it appeared as if it went higher into space,or disappeared right there,i think it went up though because you could still see the brightness of the light deminishing.man i wish i had a good camera. i would like to apolagize to all the people who been called crazy,i used to be the one calling everyone nutcases and for that,my story is being shared.at the time of my first sighting,i kept seeing [doyon government constuction trucks] all over,so i did some research and found out they specialize in underground facilities ,and they have 3 major outfits based outta alaska state.im not an investigator of anykind.just the thought of oanother race of beings staring down at us like earth is some kind of ant farm to them is scary thought.ima just say it ,when you combine abductions,the cover up by our goverment,implants,makes me wonder are some of us being sacraficed,obviously you cant beat a force thats greatly more advanced than us,its probably best we play along until we aquire,something that can put us on a equal playing field.i dont think et is gonna go for that.why do i think this is because you can find more abundant resources on any planet,except HUMANS .i know its lot to absorb but ive been holding it in 4 awhile.thanks for reading.btw look op during these summer clear nights especially in june july thats when i had my best sightings."],"Case Number":"46542","Date Submitted":"04/02/2013 01:49 UTC","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Washington","There
