It was moving pretty rapidly. I can't really give any specifics on how high up it really was, but it definitely did not seem too high up to me. I saw the object for a few seconds, then I lost sight of it. It also seemed to be a decent size. I apologize for not being able to be more specific, but I am bad at gauging these kinds of things. There is absolutely no way I could mistake this to be anything else. It stayed in a perfectly triangular formation, and it moved as one large unit."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"40.510632","City":"Hillsborough","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"New Jersey","Log Number":"US-11012010-0003"}
