I was working with a wine salesmen in San Diego and at about 5:30 we were heading towards old town and 4 lights appeared across the horizon. They looked like they were connected and then they disappeared. A moment later the lights reappeared. We were pretty amazed. That was it. These lights were rather sizable given their distance. I didn't know what to think it was.
