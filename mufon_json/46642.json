We kept driving, and even stopped at one point to observe. The orbs were in a line 2 by 2 going down Mound rd passing over 15mile. As soon as they just passed 15 mile road most of them seemed to just dim out-we could not spot them anymore. At this point we could still spot about 3, and one of them was glowing brighter than the others. We followed that one in our car, and pulled over and got out to watch it. It would sit stagnant, then move slowly descending-only to stop and move in a completely other direction."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46642.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46642.html"],"Longitude":"-83.048567","Source":"MUFON"}
