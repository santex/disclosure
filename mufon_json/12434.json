After a while we noticed it flashed red, yellow, then blue rapidly. We thought it might be a plane, but it did not appear to be moving. It didn't seem to be doing anything, so we lost interest, but after a few minutes it disappeared. Ten minutes later, it reappeared a bit to the left of where it had been. It was now moving right and we figured it could've been a plane until it started making sudden movements in all directions. It appeared to be dancing, doing things planes can't do. It changed directions very rapidly, at times moving suddenly in the opposite direction. It had the same color pattern as from before. It returned to the spot we had seen it originally and remained there for a few moments before speeding off away from us. We didn't completely lose sight of it, though it was very faint. It did a similar dancing ritual again at a distance. It moved to the left past the city before dropping suddenly out of sight."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Alta Dena","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"12434","Summary":"Star-like object, moves unlike a plane","Log Number":"US-09112008-0012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.784361,+-119.413192(12434)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12434) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/10/2008 10:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/10/2008 10:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
