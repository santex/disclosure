I woke up around 3 am, my throat felt like it was swollen and dry, so I moved to get something to drink. I got up got a Mountain Dew, took a drink and laid back down. As I was about to dose off, a big burst of light filled the front of the room, I saw three entities that were transparent, that seemed to walk right through the wall, then took solid form, then I blacked out, next I remember coming too, and a another big burst of light, I reached for my ipad and started snapping pictures, I was able to catch a photo of one of the entities leaving my room. This is the initial story. After they took solid form, two looked like greys, four foot tall, and the other looked taller, however I couldn't make the entity out, it looked like he had hood ware on, the purples of his eyes were oblong and huge. From the time that I come too, it was 5:15 am. Thanks for your time"]}
