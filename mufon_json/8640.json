{"City":"Littlerock","Log Number":"US-12202007-0002","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn November 3, 1982 I lived in Lancaster, Ca. Which is located in the Mojave Desert near Edwards Air Force Base. I didn't have curtains at that time on my window. I woke up to a bright white light shining in my window, which looked to be about 25 miles away or so, in the area of Littlerock, CA. It was so bright, cigar shaped and huge to be able to see it so far away. I was shocked to say the least and couldn't take my eyes off of it. I was afraid to blink, and it lasted about 25 seconds and dissapeared. I remember the exact date, because it was my brother in law's birthday and at the time, I remember thinking I'll never forget this day, seeing a UFO on his birthday. I only told a few people because at that time you would be thought of as crazy and not ever taken seriously."],"Object Shape":"Cigar","Latitude":"34.521104","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.521104,+-117.983679(8640)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8640) map </A>","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"I woke up to see a cigar shaped object in the distance through my window.","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Littlerock","There were no other sightings in Littlerock on or around November 3rd 1982"],"Longitude":"-117.983679","Date of the Event":"11/03/1982 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/03/1982 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8640.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8640.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"8640","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
