It was after 5.45pm because it was already dark outside. We went to the field behind our house and I looked up to the sky like I do always when the sky is clear and you can see all the stars. I saw this bright light and I said to my son \"look at that bright star\" but as I said it I realized that this particular time in the evening there's no big star at that part of the sky. And also this \"star\" was moving from south to north at the speed of an airplane only there was no sound and I couldn't see no other lights around it. We were staring at it and were really excited and I really can't tell how long it went on at this slower speed. But then suddenly it started to go towards east at higher speed and all we could see was reddish light before it disappeared completely in ab 8 seconds. As I said the sky was clear and there was no wind."],"City":"Rocky Mt","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27145.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27145.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.94349,+-77.788194(27145)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27145) map </A>"}
