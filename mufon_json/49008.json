We were approximately 20miles from Alamosa when we noticed a bright blue flashing light quite a ways in the distance. At first we thought it was maybe a police car. Then it started moving in a straight horizontal line in hops that had to be at least 2 to 3 miles in distance. It looked as though it were traveling on a road at first but then as it traveled from south around to the east then on to the north it was not following any roads. It moved faster than humanly possible and as it reached the north behind us it vanished completely. During all of this we also noticed that small animals were out in force and running towards the lights. There were so many that I couldn't avoid actually hitting a couple of them. All of this occurred between 12:30 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. on July 5,2013. We all were stunned by what we saw and have no idea what it could have been."],"Longitude":"-100.868932","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Flash","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49008.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49008.html"],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Alamosa","There were no other sightings in Alamosa on or around July 5th 2013"],"Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"49008","Latitude":"37.271712","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"Alamosa","Log Number":"US-07172013-0009","Summary":"Bright blue light flashing and moving horizontally in several mile bursts","Date Submitted":"07/17/2013 01:41 UTC"}
