I saw a definite silver cylinder with slightly rounded ends, about the apparent same size of an ordinary passenger jet, traveling almost overhead, at a fairly slow speed, although a person could not have outrun it. There was no sound, although about 2 minutes later, well after the object had disappeared, I heard the sound of an ordinary plane coming from the opposite direction and yet could not see this plane. The object traveled west to east at a level altitude but much lower than a commercial plane - perhaps just a few thousand feet. Very smooth movement, very smooth shiny surface, but there were definitely no wings, as I could see the back end of it as it moved away from me. At one point, there seemed to be air displacement around it. Just after that point, I think it may have separated horizontally slightly for a brief moment, at which time there seemed to be a red band between the two sections. The sky was blue and cloudless. From the time I noticed it in the sky until it disappeared, it traveled a distance of perhaps several miles. It seemed to just fade away, but that could have been because of distance. Sighting lasted about 1 minute and was fascinating. I did not have time to go back inside for my camera."],"Longitude":"-89.502464"}
