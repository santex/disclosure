Midway from my home to lowes I just happened to look up in front of me to my right was a huge round object patterened in black way above a tree I was passing.It then dropped about a foot. then totally went straight down.I feel weird not scared but maybe its seeing something I wasnt expecting.It was massive in size I seen no outter circle but the pattern was in a circlular shape inside the mass.I know what I seen and any hipnosis or whatever would prove it. since I was driving on a busy street with no pull over lanes I didnt look further but the area was over rocky high land."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43216.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43216.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"36.551796","Case Number":"43216"}
