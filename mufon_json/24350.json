I have it on my camera phone - but, in the moment it is filmed upside down and when I got out of the car I just left the phone and didn't think of it. Everyone outside was quiet and watching mostly. I was amazed, I have never seen anything like this. I never saw anything on TV or news about it. I was astonished and the people had gathered to watch it. We are not far from Cape Canaveral. It was viewable for about 7 minutes, it was silent and moved slowly."],"Date Submitted":"07/08/2010 09:54 UTC","City":"Melbourne","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"04/01/2010 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Other","Case Number":"24350","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Melbourne","There were no other sightings in Melbourne on or around April 1st 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24350.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24350.html"],"Log Number":"US-07082010-0009"}
