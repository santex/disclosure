I looked up at the sky as there were absolutely no clouds, and it was quite beautiful. I looked at the moon (which always amazes me when I see it in daylight). As i looked at the moon, i saw a plane flying (probably coming from Newark), and above the plane I saw this white object, I could see that it was not a plane, as it had no wings, and there were other planes flying in the area. They all look dark grey as the sun was setting in the west, and i was following the object as it flew (more like glided) from southwest to east. All of the planes that i was looking at, as i mentioned appeared dark grey and i could see the red and green lights. This object was white and was definately not a plane or a satellite. After approximately 5 - 10 minutes the object vanished from view heading in a easterly direction."],"Longitude":"-74.043474","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"New Jersey","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Summary":"White cylindrical object moving from west to east","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hackensack","There were no other sightings in Hackensack on or around August 10th 2005"],"Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.885932,+-74.043474(3725)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3725) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08102005-0004","Date of the Event":"08/10/2005 07:37 UTC","Case Number":"3725","City":"Hackensack"}
