We noticed a round, orange object in the sky . At first we thought it might be an airplane but noticed two similar objects in a line directly behind the first. The three orbs then hovered for about two minutes and then one at a time each one dimmed and vanished. Then over the course of about 15 minutes an additional 9 more orbs appeared the same way, traveling in a line,then hovering, dimming then vanishing. There was no sound whatsoever and there were 12 orbs total. We were astonished by the movement of these objects."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44895.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44895.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in West Yellowstone","There were no other sightings in West Yellowstone on or around December 31st 2012"],"Log Number":"US-01012013-0021","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"12/31/2012 07:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"01/01/2013 11:58 UTC","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.815761,+-111.253816(44895)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44895) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
