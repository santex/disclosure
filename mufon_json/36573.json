At first, the objects appeared to be some sort of fireworks; however, the cluster began to include several of the same objects, all ascending to a particular area of the sky - just slightly north-west from where they appeared. None of the objects fell toward the ground, instead, they all ascended and subsequently faded into the perfectly clear night sky. There was no sound coming from the objects."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Sandusky","There were no other sightings in Sandusky on or around March 19th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"10-20 red-orange objects ascending then fading into one general area of the northern sky.","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball, Oval, Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown"}
