My wife and I were sitting out on our patio looking south over the Sea of Cortez and suddenly we noticed approximately 7 bright orange lights that slowly maneuvered in the southeastern area of our vision. I knew they were UFO's like I have seen before in 1985. They were very bright and impossible to ignore. 2The area involved was about the size of one's handheld at arms length. I alerted our neighbor Dolores who came out of the house and witnessed the sighting for approximately 10 minutes. As the lights slowly maneuvered they changed in intensity and brightness in the area where they were first seen. Gradually one by one they dimmed and after approximately 10 minutes none were visible. There was no sound accompanying the sighting and there were no other witnesses that I know of. There was not sufficient light to make a video. No personal reaction except awe."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-111.83297"}
