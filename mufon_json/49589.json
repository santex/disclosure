I noticed three orange and bright lights in a triangle, one on top, two on the bottom. They were only there for 10 or 15 seconds. I could see some clouds on the horizon, even above the lights, but the sky was clear and many stars were out. There were 7 of our family who saw the lights. Also some strangers walking on the beach saw them. The lights apeared on and off over a 15 minute period. There were sometimes 1, other times 2 lights. They stayed bright and visible for 10 or 15 seconds. They looked as if they were burning fire. Some of the showings were round, others were more of a horizontal line which started smaller and expanded wider. There were between 6 & 8 different sightings. All were at the same point in the sky. They were further north than the savannah air port by maybe 60 degrees. The sightings were all at the same place in the sky."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/07/2013 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"49589","City":"Hilton Head Island","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"32.138336","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.138336,+-80.812835(49589)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49589) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08072013-0029","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange lights above horizon. first seen as three lights in triangle.
