My buddy Ross pointed it out. I have previously seen a UFO much closer, did research and recognized the similarities. We have had multiple cases of sights of beings in our woods, UfO's and strange noises. We have clear as day seen what we claim to be aliens or extra terrestrials. We have 3 to 5 friends willing to explain there witness after spending nights at our house. People originally thought of us as crazy, then we proved it all to them by showing them. Things are going on here, indefinitely and we need someone to come look or read in to it deeper."],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.111317,+-84.511475(21552)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21552) map </A>","Tags":"City","City":"Woodstock","Case Number":"21552","Summary":"Far away, shining red and blue beams, Neutral white.","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21552.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21552.html"],"Longitude":"-84.511475","Region":"Georgia","Log Number":"US-01192010-0001","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.111317","Sighting Duration":"00:00:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
