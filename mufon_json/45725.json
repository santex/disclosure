{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"02/10/2013 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home home when I saw a huge flash coming from the ground. I was traveling towards the Atlantic Ocean. I asked my daughter if she had seen it, we both looked over to that direction and a second flash, bright green, came from the ground . I had my window down and heard a man in the next car yell, what the hell was that! We live near Oceana Air Force base and dam neck base where jets, planes, helicopters, black hawks flashing lights and explosions are not uncommon. It was not any of these! After mentioning it, a woman told me her sister lived on Oceana af base and she had seen the same thing two years ago and they could never figure out what it was. It was not at the af base but was so huge could be seen from the base. It emanated from over the Atlantic Ocean. We were a few miles from the oceanfront, it was an extremely huge flash, it appeared to be at least a mile wide and mile high. After living here for over 15 years I have never seen anything like it! This happened on Feb 10 2013 in Virginia Beach, VA about 7pm."],"City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Virginia","Case Number":"45725","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45725.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45725.html"],"Object Features":"Dome","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Other","Summary":"2 Huge Bright green flashes appeared to be mile or more wide from from Atlantic Ocean","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.436533,+-78.649704(45725)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45725) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02162013-0004","Longitude":"-78.649704","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/16/2013 08:30 UTC","Latitude":"37.436533"}
