We sat on our step and i noticed 3 flashing red light above us it moved extremely quick they were kind of in the shape of a v. We kept watching the sky and saw a few shooting stars and then all of a sudden these bright orangey colored balls came from out of no where in a straight line above us. We only say them for 30 seconds or so but then they disappeared behind our house. There was 6 balls length wise in a row and they seemed VERY evenly spaced out. My fiance ran to the back but they were gone. I felt freaked out and scared he was extremely excited because all his life he wanted to see something like that. A few minutes later we were out back and saw 3 white lights width wise and they came from the same direction as the orange balls came over our house stayed there for a few seconds and vanished into the night sky. We then saw a helicopter flying around the area im not sure if he had anything to do with the sightings or not."],"Region":"Ontario","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.618347,+-79.428079(38274)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38274) map </A>","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Orillia","There were no other sightings in Orillia on or around May 11th 2012"]}
