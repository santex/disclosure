At first I thought it was just an airplane but it stayed in the sky in the same spot for over 20 minutes. I got my binoculars out to see if it could tell what it was. It looked like a ball of light that was shifting colors randomly and at random intervals. After an hour of looking at it with my binoculars I dusted off my telescope to have a closer look. To my astonishment it was not just a singular orb of light but many staggered lights in that appeared to be a line. I was able to observe this light structure for about an hour and a half then clouds moved in and I was no longer able to see it. It was 5-9 orbs that looked to be in a staggered line. It looked like the light was reflected and was not self emitted. The object or objects stayed in the same spot for over 2 hours. It was in the western sky at about 45 degrees from the horizon."],"trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Tempe","There were no other sightings in Tempe on or around February 22nd 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21983.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21983.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Mutable orbs of different colored light.","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
