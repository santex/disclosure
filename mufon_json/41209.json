The onject was like a fire ball. It seemed close, within 100 yards away. The following two nights, Thursday July 25th and Friday July 26th 2012 we watched several hovering saucer shaped objects from our porch over the tree line. We were unable to determine how far away they were. Each object was a series of white lights. There was one big saucer shaped object which tilted showing the bottom of the object revealing bright colored lights in green, blue, and pink. Then there were two smaller saucers with only white lights around the edge."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41209.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41209.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Emmett","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/28/2012 11:13 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-89.394978","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Region":"Illinois"}
