While getting ready before they began the show, we noticed two red lights a little off in the distance. I made a passing joke about UFO's, until we noticed they were progressively getting closer, proving they weren't fireworks because they were moving sideways and didn't explode. They were moving between 20-40 mph and were not that far above us. At one point they were directly above us. I looked away for a moment, and when I looked back they were completely vanished. I was able to take two photos on my cell phone that make them appear a little farther than they were, but they look exactly like so many other descriptions I have read from sighting all across the country."],"Date Submitted":"07/06/2012 01:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Case Number":"40293","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There was one other sighting in Dallas on or around July 5th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07062012-0008","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/05/2012 12:00 UTC"}
