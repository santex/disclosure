My fiance pointed out the light thinking it was a satellite or maybe a space station except we noticed a trail left behind. We watched as it went across the sky, stopped for a split second and then just vanished in a small flash of light but the light did't fade like a normal shooting start or meteorite would, it flashed and there was a small trail that went up, as if it stopped then shot up higher into space. It disappeared in plain view maybe 35 degrees above the horizon, no buildings or trees disrupted our view and we had a good view of other stars etc for reference (its out in the middle of nowhere and no surrounding light pollution)"],"Date of the Event":"03/08/2013 08:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-96.05802","Tags":"City","Summary":"Solid Light like a plane, flashed and disappeared as if it went up into space","Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Buffalo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON"}
