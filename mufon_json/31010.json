It was on the bottom of a disc that I would say was about 500 feet up moving from southwest to northeast against the prevailing wind. It did not make a sound as it passed over. The whole incident lasted only about 20 seconds. This is not the only time that this has happened to me. I witnessed the same light several years ago with my now ex-wife in this same location. The local TV stations were hit with a number of calls on that particular incident. The disc that I saw last night seemed to be about 40 feet in diameter. I hope that this is of value to you. I have no doubt that it was not of earthly origin."],"Latitude":"41.211402","Date Submitted":"08/18/2011 10:57 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.187065","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
