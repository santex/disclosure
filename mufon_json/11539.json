For the last four days or so the cloud formations that are hovering in midair while the normal clouds drift with the wind have appearance of cloaked ships. YOu can plainly see E.T. artistic manipulation in the cloaked cloud image. I have seen identical formations of clouds and ET caricatures along with saucer activity leaving the larger cloaked ships posted on Youtube as Texas Skies cloud ships. Fiber optics perhaps? God's strong delusion sent during the end times? I am troubled. ps: the disc changed appearance from nearly invisible to bright reflection of noon sun, to maroonish bluish. Very camouflaged yet once detected easy to follow, no great rates of speed."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.455297,+-112.071317(11539)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11539) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-07122008-0018","City":"Phoenix","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11539.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11539_submitter_file1__exampleofsimilarphenomena.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11539.html"],"Object Shape":"Disc","Source":"MUFON"}
