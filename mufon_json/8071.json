These were perhaps at 2000 feet and moving very slowly. I turned onto 14 heading north and again observed the cluster of strobing red lights, and as I did so I saw a smaller, bright white light separate from the group of red lights and travel at high speed in the opposite direction of it���s course, back toward Ann Arbor. It was quickly lost to my sight, so I looked back at the cluster of red lights while trying to stay on the road. I should have just pulled over and got out to watch, but this was an unusual thing to see, and I was so absorbed in it that I didn���t think of that at the time. As I watched the group of red strobing lights moved slowly in seeming increments along I-94 in a westerly direction and about a mile north of the freeway. As I continued on 14 I lost sight of it. I considered the smaller bright white light that had come out of it and the speed at which it had left, it���s lack of any navigation lights, and thought that perhaps the two observed objects were not ours. Of the cluster of rapidly strobing red lights I observed that it in no way complied with our standard aircraft lighting conventions, there were only red lights, and the rapid strobing also is not something one of ours would do, and the acceleration of the small bright white lighted object was quite beyond anything we can do with a manned aircraft, so all of this was pretty non-conventional. Things like this keep life interesting. I���m glad to have seen it."],"Longitude":"-83.880355"}
