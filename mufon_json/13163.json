I was driving south on I-135 and to my left there was what appeared to be an oval-shaped object, white, with a blue \"wing\" or \"fin\" to either side. My eyes could have been playing tricks on me but my wife also noted that it was just hovering for a minute and when we circled around to see what it was it was moving upward at about 30-35 degrees, gaining speed until it just disappeared. My wife said that it had to have been a blimp but I never heard of a blimp that flew that high up in the air. We weren't the only ones who saw it. Several cars on 135 slowed down to look at it."]}
