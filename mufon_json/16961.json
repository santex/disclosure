I was walking a friend to her car and she noticed a bright object in the sky and stated I should take a look at that. I said goodbye then ran in the house and retrieved my camcorder. It's not the best but I did get some 480x640 stills before it was filmed over. I believed it to be a planet and it still might be. The shape seems wrong though. It was viewed in the northwest about 3 palm hands high from a large ash tree in my yard. It could have been covered by a nickel. It seemed to be stationary. While viewing it seemed to do a \"flip\". I should have put the tape away so I'm sorry there's only these small digitals to view. Jupiter was seen in the northwest so I assumed it was that until I took video of planets and didn't achieve the same affect."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.441427,+-84.924154(16961)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16961) map </A>"}
