I sat up on the side of thebed, looked out the window. There directly above me were two dark triangles,darker than the surrounding clear sky. One was about halfway back and to theside on the first. The points of the triangular shaped crafts were soft androunded. There were three diamond shaped lights under each. These had sharpangles and added together would probably take up half the area of the underside.I didnt see them approach .. after about 3 seconds, I felt a sort of slight jerkthrough out my body .. and looked up .. they were gone .. I was calm during theexperience. My first thought on seeing them were .. I thought they were supposeto be round .. strangely enough, I felt extremely sleepy, went back to bed andimmediately fell asleep. Ive never told anyone about this and Im not sure whatvalue, if any, can be placed on the episode. It made a true believer out of me.For what its worth."],"Country":"United States"}
