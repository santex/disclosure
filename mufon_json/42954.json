{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"42954","City":"Maple Grove","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10012012-0011","divs":["Sighting DetailsThese sightings were reported directly to me, Chief Investigator William McNeff, by a friend of the witnesses. Witness A was riding in a car driven by Witness B, going home from a party and heading due southwest on Elm Road in Maple Grove. At about 1:45 AM CDT, Witness A saw an orange spherical object ahead and to the left shortly* before turning north on to Polaris Lane. Witness A pointed out the object to Witness B, and began videoing the object with her cell phone camera, while they drove slowly and stopped at Point B, about 300 ft up the street from Point A. She took about one minute of video. *Witness A originally said she saw the object after the turn. But the video clearly shows that the object was in the SSW, near the moon, and would not have been visible without turning the head more than ninety degrees to the left after the car turned, and would have soon been occluded by houses. Witness B dropped off Witness A at her parent���s home on 64th Ave. Witness B then drove to her parent���s home in Plymouth. She got out of her car in the driveway at about 2:20 AM and saw a hovering white light about due north, larger than the stars in apparent size. She guessed the actual size as perhaps that of a Volkswagen ���beetle���, but was very unsure. The sighting of this unknown object so soon after the other object frightened her, but she had presence of mind enough to shoot half a minute of video with her cell phone. The audio records expressions of fright, practically sobs. She then went into the house. The friend of the witnesses emailed the videos directly to me."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Minnesota","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.077164,+-93.447008(42954)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42954) map </A>","Summary":"Two witnesses saw and took video of orange sphere.
