I looked out and noticed this very bright orangey light, but its altitude was too low to be a star, and it was probably 8 times the size of a star (I also looked on my google sky map to make sure it wasn't a planet or star). There is also a lot of fog in the bay area, yet it was very visible. 3 commercial airplanes flew by during the sighting, so it was easy to compare and see that it was obviously not an airplane. I thought it could be a chopper but there was no noise. It seemed stationary at first, but then it moved west and disappeared. The whole thing lasted around 5-7 mins. The image was taken with a cellphone, not a very good pic, but you can clearly see something in the sky, you can compare it to the lightpost and trees."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
