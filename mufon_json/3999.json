Outside doing yard work, early-mid afternoon. A neighbor came up to talk, while I was talking with her, I saw a small silvery object high in the NE Spokane area sky (Probably over NW Idaho) that seemed to be flashing in the sunlight. It looked extremely high in altitude, and like it was tumbling. It reminded me of a fishing lure tumbling through the water, except this was larger and in the sky. It was possibly square or rectangular, too far away to tell for sure. I thought it might be a lost mylar balloon, but it stayed in the same spot for a very long time, and seemed too large. I had other chores to finish, whe I returned 90 minutes or so later is was still in the same spot. The next time I looked for it, maybe two hours after first seeing it, I was unable to find it again in the sky."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"47.66361","Longitude":"-117.416947","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"01:30:00","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Region":"Washington","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/10/2005 03:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.66361,+-117.416947(3999)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3999) map </A>","Summary":"Very high altitude, looked like a silver fishing lure tumbling and reflecting sunlight, stayed in one place for a long time.","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Spokane","There were no other sightings in Spokane on or around September 10th 2005"],"Case Number":"3999","City":"Spokane","Log Number":"US-10182005-0003","Disposition":"Unknown"}
