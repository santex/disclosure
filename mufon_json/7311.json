I thought it was the sun glinting off of an airplane, yet as it got closer I knew this was different. I yelled at my girlfriend to get the binoculars she came right out and I got focused in and it was a disc. The disc was pulsing a bright light and its speed remained constant as it flew across the entire sky . It was lower than comercial jets fly but still npretty high up. There was no sound no vapor trail. On June 23 2007 at about 10:30 pm mountain time my step son and his friends were at Sand Flats Recreation area they saw a disc pulsing as I had seen the night before. I felt fine I really enjoyed seeing the disc I know it was a UFO I could sense it in my gut. I have seen one other UFO in my life and believe that we are not alone."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Longitude":"-109.54834","Latitude":"38.578096","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.578096,+-109.54834(7311)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7311) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None"}
