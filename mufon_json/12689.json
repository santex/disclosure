{"divs":["sighting detailsi was driving se on roseville parkway, with the galleria mall on my left; i had just passed reserve drive and was approaching harding blvd when i saw a big bright, slowly pulsating red light that was slowly hovering forward about 80 - 100 feet above the mall. i was 90% sure that what i was looking at was not a helicopter, as i've seen a flying triangle twice before in my life (2 separate instances 10 years ago that i haven't reported here- will do so soon). i quickly passed over into the left lane and stopped at the red light at roseville pkwy and harding blvd. i rolled down my window to get a clearer look at the craft (car needs a wash, hehe) and i saw that it was most definitely a flying triangle, flying in reverse! what i mean by this is it was flying with a flat end forward; the two circular lights underneath the front-facing end were white, the rear light was the pulsating red light, and there was no central light\\it wasn't \"turned on.\" the previous two times i saw these, the configuration was three white corner lights and a central red pulsating light. and that's how they're usually described in other reports. so that's pretty interesting. anyway, i know it wasn't a helicopter because i saw the triangular outline of the craft as well, and could see that the body was black, even against the night sky, which was illuminated due to the mall parking lot lights. i estimate the craft was about the size of a fighter jet. also, the craft was totally silent. i could hear the heavy traffic of the cars around me, but could not hear an engine from the craft above me. i reached for my cell phone and tried taking a picture of the craft, but it flew behind the marquee of the mall, directly to my left (>_< !!!). (this was probably when the craft was at its closest to me when i had visual contact, and with the help of google maps i'm estimating this was ~200 feet away from me, and perhaps ~80 feet off the ground). i waited for it to emerge and tried getting a picture but it then was obstructed by a streetlamp, and as i glanced at my light i noticed it had turned green, so i made a u-turn on roseville pkwy so i could follow the craft. it seemed to be making a slow circle over this corner parking lot, so i pulled into the mall at reserve drive, turned right at galleria circle, then made the first possible turn into the parking lot there. (by this time, as it fully set in that i was witnessing another flying triangle after a loooong 10 year wait, and was in active pursuit of the thing, i had a massive rush of adrenaline, or fear, or both, because my left leg started shaking involuntarily, my heart was fluttering, and my whole body was slightly trembling). at this point i had lost sight of the craft, until i was at the edge of the parking lot facing roseville pkwy. i saw that it was flying sw. i turned around back to roseville pkwy, and went forward onto reserve dr when the light turned green. as i did so, i called my mom on my cell and said \"guess what i'm following right now?\" she said \"no!\" she immediately knew what i was talking about, because each of the times i saw a triangle 10 years ago, she had been driving me home (from a friend's birthday party each time, oddly). i told her i was going to try to follow it and hung up. but as it turns out, i had made a boneheaded error by going down reserve drive. being uneducated about my hometown, the one i've lived in for my whole life, i didn't know that reserve drive was not a through road connecting to another major thoroughfare. but it probably didn't matter anyway, because after i had pulled out of the mall, the craft had picked up considerable speed. by the time i got to the dead end of reserve drive, the triangle had flown several miles away toward the red warning lights on a tower i took to be the one at around baseline rd and walerga rd, which is about a 6 mile drive according to google maps, so perhaps 5 miles as the crow (or grey :p) flies. from my perspective it seemed that the craft had basically reached those warning lights by the time i reached the end of reserve drive, which was probably 40 seconds or so (i was going about 50, it's a 20mph zone... sorry. there wasn't any traffic on this road though!) for something to fly away that fast, it would have to make a noise, if it were a conventional aircraft. but there was no engine noise - total silence, as when i had seen it circling over the mall parking lot. anyway, there's actually more to this story. i made a u-turn and went west on roseville pkwy to try to follow the craft, but lost sight of it pretty quickly thereafter (about this time, my leg stopped shaking, and my body stopped trembling). i drove around for awhile after that. went all the way down baseline rd, toward the airport, thinking the craft might be headed that way, then after not seeing anything anywhere (which would be easy because this area is flat farmland, not really illuminated, you can see more stars, etc.) i made a u-turn just before pleasant grove rd (not to be confused with pleasant grove blvd). headed back to the mall, then drove to wendy's. got a #9 with a sprite. dee-lish. waited in the parking lot, looking up through the moonroof as i chowed down, didn't see anything. drove home, then went for a very long walk. at around 11:30 pm, as i was walking westward on blue oaks blvd, i saw directly to my right (the north) a craft flying low, also to the west, maybe 5 miles away. i'm pretty sure it was the triangle, turned on its side: i saw one strobing white light, perhaps 5 quick pulses, followed by three red lights in a triangle pattern, this time with a central red light. this pattern kept repeating: five-ish white light strobes (seemed like just one white light), lasting about a second, then darkness for maybe half a second, then all of a sudden the triangular red lights would come on really bright and solid, lasting maybe two seconds, then a half second of darkness. rinse and repeat. i quickened my pace to keep up with the triangle, then eventually had to start jogging, then running flat out, until i ran out of breath at about crocker ranch rd (god i'm out of shape). shortly thereafter i lost sight of the craft. all in all, a pretty awesome night! hope i don't have to wait another 10 years to see one of these mysterious triangles."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Roseville","There were no other sightings in Roseville on or around September 20th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"California","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-121.280706","City":"Roseville","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/20/2008 09:03 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/20/2008 09:03 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.754934,+-121.280706(12689)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12689) map </A>","Case Number":"12689","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12689.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12689_submitter_file1__Map1_SacramentoAreaRoads.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12689_submitter_file2__Map2_SummaryOfTwoSightings.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12689_submitter_file3__Map3_RosevilleGallerial_AreaSatPhoto.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12689_submitter_file4__Map4_RosevilleGalleria_AreaStreetMap.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12689_submitter_file5__Map5_RosevilleGalleria_GroundTrack.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12689.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.754934","Log Number":"US-09212008-0006","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Triangle hovering over mall, then taking off rapidly"}
