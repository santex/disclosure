The north side of my house has twelve windows, arranged at the house's corner, 2 stacks of three on each side of the corner to about 24 feet high, so there is plenty to see. I noticed the first light in the rightmost top window, it had an arc to it as it fell, which eventually became a straight line down. The light was constant & white, with a small blue twinge to it's edges. It had no speed or didn't appear to be propelled, was just kind of falling at the normal rate one might expect any object to fall. There was no trail. Initially, I had thought it was a shooting star or meteorite, until I had a minute to think about it's odd behavior. The second light appeared in the middle of the left side windows, it had the same color as the first, but accelerated straight up at an alarming rate. I would estimate the distance from the first light somewhere between 5 and 7 miles apart. The third was seen by us both, in about the exact middle area between the first two. It was moving more horizontally, but not in a straight line as an aircraft would. Instead, it kind of lazily meandered about���a little up & a little down at a relaxed speed before it disappeared behind the mountain, but had the same light color & properties as the first two did."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
