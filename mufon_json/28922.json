(Usually this is just a plane that they are seeing) I went out without my camera to see it. When I got out there it was just flying over the house. It seemed to have a black band around the middle.I am certain that it didn't have any wings. By the time I had gotten my camera it was pretty far away. It was hard to make it out against the hazy cloud cover. I did get two pictures. The first two are unedited and the last one has only been sharpened and colors enhanced. I would like to know if this is just a type of weather baloon drone or what. Last summer we saw exactly the same thing flying in the same direction SW to NE but there were 3 of them flying close together in a straight line."],"City":"Littleton","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.311822,+-71.761588(28922)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28922) map </A>","Country":"United States","Latitude":"44.311822","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Littleton","There were no other sightings in Littleton on or around April 28th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
