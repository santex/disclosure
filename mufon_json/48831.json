Wildwood, N.J. Schellinger Ave., WATERPARK - sunbathing on a lounge chair, facing the ocean (very end of pier) I was looking at beach & ocean. 2. There was nothing in the sky at the time, except this spot. 3. I was looking at the horizon, a bird or kite or airplane at a very high altitude. 4. It was a dull black in color, it seemed to be stationary, it then rotated or rolled as the sun broke through a cloud and a bright (spark-like) reflection caught my eye, I had to blink and it was gone. 5. I thought \"WOW, I saw another one.\" I asked my son-in-law if he saw it but, he did not. 6. After blinking from the flash in my eyes, I lost it, I continued to watch the sky but, no other sightings."],"Date Submitted":"07/09/2013 03:18 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-74.811219","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Wildwood","There were no other sightings in Wildwood on or around July 7th 2013"],"Latitude":"39","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"New Jersey","Source":"MUFON","City":"Wildwood","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"the sun came thru hazey clouds, hit it, then a super bright flash(reflection)","Log Number":"US-07092013-0009"}
