Returned 6 min. later to see if it was still there & it was took another photo , by this time it was dark outdoors . Teenagers were passing by me & looked at what I was looking at smiling & taking photos , & hear them , wow so bright is it a star , than another person said no it's low , than maybe a plane or something than the boy said no it's just there sitting not moving , ah maybe it's ufo , I did not say anything to them & kept on looking at this beautiful radiating \"object\" as I did not want to loose sight of it , I was enveloped in peaceful awe . Once the photos were on eye photo I was somewhat disappointed as although the colors were as on the 'object' it didn't even resemble the shape but rather it seems as if kept on shapes which I haven't seen at all nor those kids . Later I was showing it , on the computer, to an aquaintance & he said it still looked amazing .
