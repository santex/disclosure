Being a big UFO enthusiast I decided to stop and get out of the car to get a better look, upon doing so a third light appeared completing the triangle, I also so noticed they did seem to be on fire, flickering and edges dancing. The formation stayed for about 1 min, the two that had previously appeared now disappeared slowly in reverse order. I noticed what appeared to be a helicopter now approaching from the NW towards the remaining object which then moved towards the helicopter, est 500m from the heli the object disappeared. As soon as I saw the second light appear I knew this was special."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.307662,+-2.596406(41614)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41614) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Region":"England","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/10/2012 05:20 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Fireball","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"52.307662"}
