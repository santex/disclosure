I had been birdwatching so had binoculars. As I crossed a field, I saw an orange light, shining directionally towards the north, emitting a visible beam in low, broken cloud ahead of an approaching thunder storm. I stopped to watch, seeing the beam fade. I used binoculars then. The light extinguished, leaving a dark, angular object which hovered or moved slowly and without audible noise. No navigation lights were lit, nor any other light after the beam extinguished. This in spite of being only some five miles from a regional airport. I was about 200 yards from it horizontally and the object was, I would guess, at an elevatin of about 500 feet over houses. As the storm was rapidly approaching and rain starting to fall on my location, I decided to continue on my way, as I was standing in the middle of a field(!). The object was still there as I left."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Nottingham","There were no other sightings in Nottingham on or around May 15th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.901238,+-1.19604(30811)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30811) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"","Summary":"Directional light, fading, leaving dark, angular object hovering","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-1.19604","City":"Nottingham","Date Submitted":"08/11/2011 03:12 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"GB-08112011-0009","Latitude":"52.901238"}
