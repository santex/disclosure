{"Sighting Duration":"00:03:55","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving the kids to school and my youngest daughter (11) saw a very bright light going across the sky. She asked what it was. I looked and saw the light. I thought it was a satellite, but both of my daughters said that it was too bright. Then as we were watching it, it turned directions. We finished heading down the hill and looked around again, and then it disappeared."],"Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"10/24/2008 06:57 UTC","Longitude":"-121.888727","Log Number":"US-10252008-0009","Latitude":"47.567324","Region":"Washington","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"very bright light going across the sky, changing directions and then disappeared","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Fall City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"10/24/2008 06:57 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.567324,+-121.888727(13225)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13225) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fall City","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13225.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13225.html"],"Case Number":"13225"}
