{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a humid night, not clear. you could see the moon and maybe one star. I was in Meridian Hill Park and saw a strange light moving slowly across the sky heading South. It abruptly turned left to the East then after a while appeared to be lowering, then the light went out. i couldnt tell how high up it was, but i dont thik it would be too high becasue you couldnt see anything else ecept the moon last night. My friend who was with me had seen a diamond shaped UFO up close as a 10 year old and also seen others said \"that's how they move\". It was strange, if anyknown has any info on what that might have been or if anyone else saw it, that would be great."],"Date Submitted":"05/27/2009 09:15 UTC","City":"Washington","Region":"District of Columbia","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.901622,+-77.027716(17211)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17211) map </A>","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Washington","There was one other sighting in Washington on or around May 27th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-05282009-0014","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"A light like a planet on an overcast night moved across the sky, took a left and then lowered and went out.","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.027716","Latitude":"38.901622","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17211.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17211.html"],"Case Number":"17211","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/27/2009 09:15 UTC"}
