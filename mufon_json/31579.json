I live on the ninth story of my building and went to the window to draw down the blinds when I saw the lights. My window faces due east. Normally I watch planes come in to land at Minneapolis airport. Last night I saw two lights hovering approximately 2 miles distance from my position where no lights had appeared before. At first I thought they were planes but they didn't move. They hovered over the tops of the trees. One of them hovered about 100 Feet over the tree top and the other about 200 feet above the tree tops. There was about 300 feet of space between the two. When I first saw them they were two solid white lights then they started flashing Red, Yellow, Green, and White lights. I had watched them for about 3 minutes looking for movement when the lowest one winked out of existence. The five minutes later the 2nd one did the same."],"Region":"Minnesota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31579.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31579.html"],"Case Number":"31579","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/06/2011 12:54 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
