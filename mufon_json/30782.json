I noticed a number of jets and recreational planes flying around the storm. I looked at my cell phone to see what time it was (12:38 AM), but when i looked almost straight up i saw what appeared to be another jet, but as the object got directly above me the light patterns were unusual; two white blinking lights with a red pulsating light at the front. The lights were in a triangular formation, and the object made a slight jet-like sound, but it was very faint. Perhaps it was a jet slowing down it's engines, but the speed is what really caught my attention; i estimate the object was approximately 10,000-15,000 feet above the ground and moving over 600 mph, which would be unusual for a commercial jet. The object then moved to the east of me where it began to bank to the left (towards the northeast) appearing to fly around the thunderstorm about 7 or 8 miles to the north. This all happened within a 1 to 2 minute time frame."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
