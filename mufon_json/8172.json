{"City":"San Jose","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving North or West on the 138 with a friend, Ed Williams - retired Air Force, I saw a bright light in the sky. After watching it a moment or so, I could tell it was somewhat triangular in shape or appeareance. I then asked Ed if he could see it. When he finally cought a glimpse of what I was looking at, we pulled over. It looked as though it was over Edwards Air Force base from the angle and direction we were looking in. Anyway, not much later, there were suddenly 3 of them. They formed a triangle out of the 3 lights and then, faster than I could really register what was going on, lights of every color I've ever seen, and then some came flashing out of all 3 things. Then, they were simply gone! I was fascinated because, around 1977, in Mojave, 3 friends of mine and I saw almost the exact same phenomenon."],"Summary":"Lights over Edwards","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were no other sightings in San Jose on or around August 16th 1980"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8172.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8172.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/16/1980 03:24 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Other","Sighting Duration":"01:28:09","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"37.380844","Case Number":"8172","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10192007-0006","Longitude":"-121.843451","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/16/1980 03:24 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.380844,+-121.843451(8172)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8172) map </A>"}
