(wind was blowing in a slightly different direction) The sunlight reflected off it and it had bubble like impressions in the surface, the lower part was dark and i didn't see it clearly. I walked around my vehicle to see it before the tree obstructed it's view, i went out to the street and it was gone. No ballons, birds, planes or other objects was in the sky. I saw it for a total of about 10 seconds and about 30 some feet in the air. It looked to me like the magnetic field from the power lines exposing the tangent of a sphere but not more than a few feet wide and 9 feet high was exposed."],"trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Greensburg","There were no other sightings in Greensburg on or around May 29th 2012"],"Summary":"Silver object moving slow over power lines","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38616.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38616.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/29/2012 11:20 UTC"}
