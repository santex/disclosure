(since we were facing west, it's also possible the object was not hovering but rather moving west to east or east to west after it appeared to stop.) we could see the trail and the \"unmoving\" object for a total of 10 minutes or so until it got too dark to see through the binoculars. the pictures we took do not even begin to show the brightness of the trail. based on the \"distance to horizon\" calculator on the internet, we estimated the distance to the object was about 15.5 nautical or 17.9 statute miles. (we did a google earth calculation that showed our rental house was 172 feet above sea level and, adding the five-foot height of the tripod, resulted in a \"height of eye\" of 177 feet.) if the object was almost 18 miles away, the object would have to be quite large to appear as big as it did, even though it required binoculars to see it. our collective conclusion was that the object was too big to be any kind of airplane and that the trail was not a vapor trail. the way the object appeared to stop and hover, and the fact that the trail did not dissipate, were also very strange. maybe it was some kind of missile, but we sure can���t figure it out. none of us had ever seen such a thing."],"Tags":"City","City":"Bodega Bay","Longitude":"-123.048057","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Sphere","Latitude":"38.33325","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"09/17/2007 07:17 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.33325,+-123.048057(7999)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7999) map </A>"}
