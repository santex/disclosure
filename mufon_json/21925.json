I immediately thought of UFOs. A similar thing happened in Natchitoches Parish (about an hour and a half south of Minden) a couple of weeks earlier. Heads were removed with little or no blood. In the Natchitoches case, entrails were tied in knots and returned to the body . I'm attaching the Minden Press-Herald article. The story also appeared in the Shreveport Times website the same day."],"Longitude":"-93.286835"}
