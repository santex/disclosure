A bright white light, and a dimmer red one to the side. Itseemed to be on a descending pathmaybe a 15 degree angle from the earths surface. It was low on the horizon,perhaps it went right into Lake Ontario, or perhaps it was further south. Itwas moving very fast, and only appeared for about a quarter of a second, but Ilooked right at it."],"City":"Toronto","Tags":"City"}
