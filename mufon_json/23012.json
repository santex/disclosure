I pulled into a parking lot and happened to glance the object through my sunroof. The shape was a bit like a rock, mostly circular, but with details I couldn't make out. The wind was really gusting as a huge storm was about to hit. It hung there and was eventually swallowed up by the clouds, which were whipping through the sky. I watched the object from my car, through the sun roof, in the parking lot of ollie's discount warehouse on pittsburgh street. It did not re-emerge from the cloud. I went into the store and felt very anxious, as I could not rationally explain away what I had seen. I bought binoculars, so that I wouldn't be caught off guard again. This is the second UFO I've seen since I moved here. 2 years ago, I witnessed an object which was widely reported by others in the local news paper. The object I witnessed was in the night sky, around 11 pm...it was a point of light which arced around Jupiter, and shot off straight up, away from our earth."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-79.530959","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.302878,+-79.530959(23012)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23012) map </A>","Log Number":"US-04282010-0014","Latitude":"40.302878","Date of the Event":"04/16/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
