Not thinking anything unusaul of it, i laid back again only to find the same star on the opposite side of the sky i had just seen it in, just seconds before....i then just stared at it, watching to see what it would do and i as i watched it it slowly seemed to evaporate or something, i mean it slowly disappeared. ithen told chris what i saw, and was extremely amzed myself to what i had just witnessed. i then searched across the sky to see if it would randomly show up somewhere else in the sky, and chris was there searching with me. in about 6 min after watching this star disappear infront of my eyes, we found it. again in a far distance from where it was the last time we saw the \"star\". i told chris then to watch it with me to see if i could show him what i had just seen. and within a few seconds it started to disappear. we then out of instinct both looked ahead, where we were facing an empty space in a clutter of trees in the country side, and the star and that we had been watching was what seemed to be falling from te sky. at first we thought it was shot down or something weird like that, but then coming from below, on earth, were two missle like objects, both at the same speed and distance from the falling star, i have to admit it was pretty weird. but then as the missles got closer the star seemed to grow larger and as they were to have hit, everything vanished, not a sound, not an explotion, nothing.?.?....i think its strange what i saw that day and although i remember everything about the incedent, i cant quite seem to remeber exactly what happened when it colided. i mean, i remebered it was as if they just disappeared but, i cant really remember it. i cant quite eplain it as weird as it sounds.....but i never spaek of what i saw not even with chris, i seemed to always forget to bring it up when im with him. i have no pictures, and i dont have the time to sketch it out but, if anyones interested let me know and ill draw every detail......but this was all just a silly day dream or something, i just thought that maybe if i posted this, maybe someone else has seen something like too."]}
