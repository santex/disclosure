I looked all around the house and then realised it was probably the heating and the pipes outside. I went outside to check and looked up to see the pipe when I noticed a grayish blue disc shape at a high altitude above my house. At first I thought it was some kind of plane or star. I was fascinated watching it as every few seconds it glowed bright blue. It must have been massive because at the height that it was, I could still see it spinning, and the whirring was still there. After 2-3 minutes it began to move from left to right over and over again. And then I realised what it could have been and I couldnt believe what I was seeing. I mean, I was shocked to see this huge disc thing. It began to speed up from left to right and back again when I backed up to get a better look, it glowed really bright white and then it was gone. I went back inside and havent stopped thinking about it since!"],"Latitude":"41.083575","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"6843","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/18/2007 01:23 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6843.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6843.html"]}
