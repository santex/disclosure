Had just flown over Great Lakes , Was taking photos of clouds and noticed a flash from below. I expected to see a plane emerge from clouds below us, instead noticed a strange looking cloud start moving towards our plane. The cloud became more solid in appearance and was pale yellow color dome shaped. It moved steadily towards right side of plane and did I not follow the same direction of all the other clouds which were streaming past. I managed to video it as it passed by back of plane. It's not a clear video due to ice crystals on window and difficulty of filming through small window."],"Object Features":"Dome","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34397.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34397.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Observed during commercial flight over Great Lakes","Case Number":"34397","Object Shape":"Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.317634,+-85.597124(34397)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34397) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
