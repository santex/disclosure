While watching it, it turned sharply and moved 90 degrees from it's original trajectory smoothly in the sky as it had before. I know for a fact that no satellite turns, as it has no jets and is suspended in orbit. I am more than 5000 ft above sea level and see the stars clearly. I noticed it because it was the only thing moving in the sky. I lost sight of the object when it disappeared from view behind the mountain horizon, but it was thousands [or more] miles away."]}
