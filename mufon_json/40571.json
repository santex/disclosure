Th reason why I noticed it was because the blinking lights were very bright and they were very random. I first saw the lights near the center of the sky blinking in a very random fashion but they were still all in a group. Then it shot across the sky very fast an started blinking randomly again then just took off into the distance within a split second. There was no sound or anything. I was practically mesmerized for a bit before I told my boyfriend to look at it. I could really formulate any sentences cause the lights were so bright I didn't wanna look away."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.505917,+-82.720475(40571)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40571) map </A>","Region":"North Carolina","Summary":"Random blinking lights changing direction Super fast then taking off","Date Submitted":"07/07/2012 09:53 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07072012-0140"}
