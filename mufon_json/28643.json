I walked out onto my patio deck to have a smoke when something caught my attention in the north sky about 400-500 ft in the air. There was a perfectly round ball or sphere of light that was static. At first I thought it may be a balloon, but balloons don���t sit still in the air, they always move with the wind. This object was almost directly above me and was not moving at all. I watched it for a few minutes before running into the garage and grabbing my telescope. As I am setting up the scope the sphere continues to stay static. About 10 minutes have passed at this time. I focus in on the object and all I see is a brilliant perfectly round ball of beautiful white hot light. The object never moves and stays in my sights the whole time. At this time my neighbor Jeff stops by and I tell him to look up to see the sphere. He sees it and is just as puzzled as I am. He looks into the scope and sees exactly what I see, a perfect white ball. We continue to gaze at the object for a few more minutes until we move on to another subject. A few minutes pass when I look up and the object is gone. That was the only and last time I have ever seen anything so perfect, except my wife.
