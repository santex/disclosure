It wasn't until I pulled the photos into photoshop to create a pano shot from several photos that I noticed a shiny object in one of the photos. I zoomed in on what appears to be a double sphere shaped object. May be a plane but it left no \"vapor\" trail like all the other planes did that day. If it was a plane, it makes me wonder why other aircraft were leaving miles-long trails. I do not know how long it was there and can not estimate altitude. It appears as though it is a similar altitude as the trails but have no way to know for sure. For what it is worth, I don't get a lot of air traffic over my home and have a difficult time explaining 10's or 20's of vapor trails running perfectly parallel to each other. I am including the original shot which contained the UFO as well as a zoom of the same shot."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/23/2005 11:59 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.686403,+-75.743027(30258)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30258) map </A>","Region":"Delaware","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"30258","Log Number":"US-07192011-0006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30258.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30258_submitter_file1__Chemtrails122305-117.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30258_submitter_file2__Chemtrails122305-117zoom1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30258.html"],"Latitude":"39.686403","Summary":"UFO in what I believe to be chemtrails","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/19/2011 10:15 UTC"}
