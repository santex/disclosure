I was driving home on Pelandale Rd in Modesto towards Riverbank and witnessed something bright just show up and dropped from the sky slow down and do a U turn and then fell again. It kept going to where it looked like it was going to hit the ground and it changed color to purple as it got closer to the ground. Wondering where it may have gone I happened to look to the left of me in a auto center parking lot, less than a football field away, saw a strange light in line with the street lights a red round light with 3 or more blue lights that were smaller than the single red light the combo of the lights of the red and blue made like a purple.It was not large infact it fit right in with the street lights from a distance and was dead still. I could not grasp what I was looking at.I was still driving while I was trying to figure out what that combo of lights was. At the intersection of Pelandale and Mc Henery I made a left turn hoping to get a glimpse of the \"thing\" from a different angle and by that time, it was in the air hoovering around quietly and almost balloon like but not going up in to the sky like a balloon but more like a deflated balloon. I pulled off and parked on the side of Mc Henery and tried to get a cell phone photo of it but it would not show up on my screen. The photo was black. It was not a large object. I left and it was still just hoovering in the air. I have a really hard time grasping what I just saw and even wierder is that from the looks of the bright object falling from the sky and then seeing the small red and multi blue lighted object I have a really hard time coralating that that would be the same object but the color of the \"thing\" was similar purple hue. Nobobody saw it but me that I could tell. It was at around 8:17-8:25 pm. Cars just kept going around me and it was very subtle and the lights were confusing."],"Longitude":"-120.995018","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.646787,+-120.995018(20355)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20355) map </A>","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Modesto","There were no other sightings in Modesto on or around November 6th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"11/07/2009 01:29 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
