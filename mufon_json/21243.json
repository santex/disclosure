{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Tennessee","Summary":"2 extremely bright orangish/white (slightly pulsating lights) spherical objects interacting w/ each other. Moved in ways in the sky like nothing I've ever seen.","divs":["sighting detailsi was walking out of the pie in the sky pizza restaurant with my to-go order. i am walking down the stairs toward the car (rear of pizza place is a parking lot for apartments). i noticed 2 extremely orangish\\white objects next to each other in the sky approx. 2 miles to the east. the apartments sit on a hilltop, and you can see very far to the east. the lights were slightly pulsating and brighter than any aircraft or other object i've ever seen in the night sky. i actually saw an aircraft north of the objects and they looked nothing like it. i was looking around the parking lot to grab the attention of others, but there was no one around that would have been able to see them from my vantage point. the buildings would have blocked their view and i wasn't going to yell at the only person i saw all the way across the parking lot. at first, the 2 objects were next to each other. then they moved away from each other and moved back together. next, they started making circle maneuvers in the sky as if one was chasing the other. next, one moved above the other one and then it ascended diagonally away from the other one. then, they both stopped maneuvering and hovered in place. i ran to my truck and drove up to the top of the parking lot to see if i could catch a peek of them again. by the time i got to the top of the lot, they were moving at a very high rate of speed to the southeast. i then lost track of them because of trees and other buildings. these were definately in no way shape or form an aircraft or flares. there is nothing that i know of that can make perfect circles in the sky like they did. also, the lights slightly pulsated and were about 15 times brighter that any flare i've ever seen. we all know that aircraft landing lights can look bright, but these orangish\\white lights were again about 10-15 times brighter than anything that is man made in the sky. they both were about 1\\2 the size of a full moon in the sky. unfortunately, i did not have a camera with me as it was still in my bag at home as i had just returned from visiting family for the holidays. i do not use drugs and i rarely drink alcohol. i was not under the influence of any intoxicants when i saw what i saw. both of my brothers described a similar event to myself and my parents a few years ago. they saw the same spherical objects (they saw 4) in a very remote area of maine calleds machias bay (near cutler, maine). i wasn't sure what to think, but i am now a believer as what i saw could not be anything that is man made."],"Latitude":"36.06944","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21243.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21243.html"],"City":"Antioch","Longitude":"-86.664142","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Other","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-12292009-0012","Case Number":"21243","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Antioch","There were no other sightings in Antioch on or around December 28th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"12/28/2009 07:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/29/2009 12:36 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.06944,+-86.664142(21243)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21243) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown"}
