{"Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Latitude":"39.411355","Region":"Maryland","Case Number":"11966","Summary":"I saw 3 lights equally spaced apart.","Date of the Event":"07/24/2008 01:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-08072008-0008","Longitude":"-79.398042","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","divs":["Sighting DetailsI've already sent you the information on my \"would-be sighting.\" This is a follow up email to let you know that I found perhaps what could be additional evidence. I was cutting the grass today and happened to notice two circles in the tall grass that were longer and greener than the rest of the grass. A rough guess would be that the circles were each 20' in circumference. One was in the approximate area where I had viewed the lights in the pictures I sent previously. The other was farther to the left of our backyard. I saw nothing in that area. I will attach the pictures I took of the grass. I do have more if you wish to see them but these are the ones that turned out the best. Pictures 49 & 50 were in the area where I saw the lights. #62 is of the other circle. Please note that I had started cutting through the first circle before I realized that this might be important evidence. Of course, I am not sure what this was but I thought it seemed strange.
