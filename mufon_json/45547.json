{"divs":["Sighting Details We were coming home from downtown Edmond on Broadway when my wife and I saw 8 bright orange objects on the horizon towards the northwest over Deer Creek Oklahoma that looks like the Big Dipper. They were too large for stars and we knew that, there are no large antenna towers in the area. We immediately decided to turn down Coffee Creek Avenue to be able to face them while we drove. We pulled off the road and got out of our truck to observe that the objects that we thought were not moving, but indeed were moving together, slowly across the sky. The round objects look like fireballs that were bigger than a commercial plane but perfectly round. Two of the lead fireballs faded away, as if they just turned off a gaslight. Then two more turned off their lights. We could see the remaining fireballs were coming our way, so we got back in our truck and turned right onto N. Kelley Ave. We went little ways and saw that the 4fireballs were now very close and we wanted to try to get a picture of them, so we pulled over at Cross Timbers elementary school. We noticed a guy was also in the parking lot looking up into the sky, so we went over to talk to him. We told him that we just saw 8 fireballs that looks like the big dipper 4 of them disappeared. all of us watched as the orange fireballs moved directly overhead of where we were. They looked like they were only going 15 mph but we figured out that they had crossed 15 miles in 10 min. to get to us, so they were really doing about 90 mph. We estimate that they were at about 2000 feet above us and they made no sound at all. Two more quickly faded out of sight, which left two remaining and I took a picture of one of them with my cell phone. Then those two went straight up in the sky to about 40,000 feet and then there lights went out to. Later, when we zoomed in on the picture from my cell phone, we could see that the orange fireballs were in reality white boomerang shaped objects. It seems the fire emitted, was merely to get our attention."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/19/2012 09:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.013462,+-97.086867(45547)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45547) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","City":"Edmond KO.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Edmond KO.","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Oklahoma","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45547.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45547.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"8 Fireballs in the sky looking like the Big Dipper.","Log Number":"US-02032013-0009","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/03/2013 03:05 UTC","Longitude":"-97.086867","Case Number":"45547","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Fireball","Latitude":"35.013462"}
