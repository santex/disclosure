They were stationary, and unevenly spaced - there were several groups of three or so, and a few a little bit separated. I stared at them for several minutes trying to figure out what the were (and they were beautiful), but I was on my way to deliver something, and had to get back. So I made my stop, and came back about ten minutes later, and they were gone. We have had a balloon festival this past weekend, but that was in Sequim, and these lights were round, all the same size, didn't move at all."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
