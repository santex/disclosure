It was wide as it came out of the jet and tapered off to a point as it trailed, but it left a perfect eye at the wide end that made it look exactly like a needle. I thought this would make a good picture so I took three pictures in succession with my iphone just to make sure one came out good. It was 10:20 AM. Unfortunately, the eye of the needle didn���t come out in any of the pictures and I was disappointed. But when I looked closely at the third picture I saw something that I didn't see in the first two pictures that I took. It was lower than the jet and just off the horizon and looked like a perfect triangle. I also noticed a very faint trail from the lower left point of the triangle going down at an angle. I had not noticed it in the first two pictures so I went back and examined them closely. There was nothing in the first photo but when I zoomed in on the second photo right at the horizon, I located the triangle again, but much fainter. Without overlaying the photos, it appeared to be at a direct angle down from the faint trail left by the triangle in the third photo. The triangle had not been visible to the naked eye when watching the con trail. The first three photos that I have attached are the three photos I took and are in order. The forth photo is the triangle in photo three zoomed in and circled. The fifth photo is the photo two with the triangle circled at the horizon. My first thought upon seeing the triangle in photo three was a reflection from the sun. But upon locating the triangle in photo two in a different location and nothing in the first photo, I have ruled that out and will wait for an expert opinion. All the photos were taken in rapid succession and without any change of camera position. I will be anxious to know what the experts think.
