{"Date of the Event":"07/26/2010 01:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at an apartment parking lot which is across the street from south point casino in Las Vegas. All of a sudden something in the sky catches my attention because it was really bright. At first i tought that the color of the casino was shinning on the objects making them look orange, but after a couple of seconds i see that the three objects are in fact orange and they are close to each other moving from side to side and heading south towards california. They were flying slow and not high up, and it seemed like one was getting too close to the other one like if it was going to crash into it. I felt confused because I was amazed and afraid at the same time because i had no idea what it could be. They did not have any flashing lights like airplanes have, I really feel like they were not from this world. After about 5 minutes i could not see them anymore because the apartments were in the way. I will never forget what i saw and it just makes me wonder what's out there."],"Date Submitted":"10/29/2010 02:18 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around July 26th 2010"],"City":"Las Vegas","Log Number":"US-10292010-0012","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.122566,+-115.162866(26192)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26192) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26192.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26192.html"],"Region":"Nevada","Case Number":"26192","Latitude":"36.122566","Summary":"I saw three orange ufo's flying close to each other","Longitude":"-115.162866","Tags":"City"}
