(I'm not sure of which road)in Harris County at apporximately 5:30 AM EDT, When both of us saw a flash of white light, very close to the ground, that lasted 3-5 seconds. I thought the object was a car's headlights, but the flash occured roughly 20 ft. in front my friend's car, and the nearest intersection was roughly 500 ft. away. The flash in question appeared and disappeared very quickly. My first reaction was, \"what the ****!\".
