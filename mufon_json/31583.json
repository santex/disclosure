{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI and my sister were in our mother's apartment in Cap d'Ail France (06320) which is high and overlooks the sea. We were watching the horizon and saw for 30 seconds a thin white object of about 100 meters long traveling just above the water level without leaving any traces and a few meters far from the boats around. It was heading towards the coast at constant speed and as fast as a helicopter, its trajectory was perfectly linear. This happened on Monday September 5th 2011 around 12PM. Nothing in the local press yet...
