I immediately assumed it was a meteor, but when I focussed on it, I saw that it was actually three sets of three star-like lights (3 x 3) flying overhead at a very rapid pace. It appeared to be three objects because each set of three was in the shape of a flat triangle (almost a straight line each) moving simultaneously, but each object (set of 3 lights) was moving separately from the other two objects and changing formation as it flew by. It was like three birds or jets flying next to each other that constantly changed positions relative to each other. The observation path started near the star Capella (NW) and continued in an E or NE direction and lasted approximately 3-4 seconds until they faded away near the North. The objects were definitely not meteors because they were changing formation, were moving to fast to be any type of jet. There was no sonic boom or any sound whatsoever."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Guelph","There were no other sightings in Guelph on or around March 29th 2013"]}
