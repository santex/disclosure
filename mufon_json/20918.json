{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"New Mexico","Summary":"hit the stealth blimp with a laser","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside with the dogs when I noticed something there in the sky moving to the west. It looked like a black triangle with lights. The size of it was very alarming. I pulled out my glock as a precaution. After my initial shock I became very curious. I activated the laser sight on my glock and illuminated the object. I was suprised that it didnt make a dot on the object but a strange blurry patch. I continued lasering the object for several more minutes as it made its way across the sky. It really seemed to me like it was some kind of massive cargo lifter. But why make it black and fly it at night? I asked several people at the training center here and they told me it was a stealth blimp and to zip it if I wanted to keep my job."],"City":"Artesia","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20918.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20918.html"],"Case Number":"20918","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Artesia","There were no other sightings in Artesia on or around November 29th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/08/2009 11:06 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.851894,+-104.401796(20918)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20918) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/29/2009 11:02 UTC","Log Number":"US-12082009-0004","Longitude":"-104.401796","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.851894","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
