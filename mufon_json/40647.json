One of them said \"look, a meteorite\". We looked and immediately realized this was no meteor. We saw a bright orange orb, spherical in shape, moving at a rate of speed unattainable by aircraft that I have seen. It was silent and moved in a straight line at a constant speed. We three agreed that we have never seen anything like it or even remotely like it. It traversed the sky from horizon to horizon, south to north in about 20 seconds. The sky was clear and warm with little or no wind."],"Log Number":"CA-07092012-0028","Summary":"Witnessed a bright orange orb moving from south to north a very high rate of speed.
