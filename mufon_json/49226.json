The light was white and occasionaly redish orange. It was at a further distance and traveling north and when I asked my wife to see it, I lost sight of it and it was directly above us. When I finally caught sight of it, my wife looked away and it vanished before my eyes. I didn't know what it was and I felt as if it was under intelligent control."],"Longitude":"-122.665233","Region":"Washington","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.681674,+-122.665233(49226)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49226) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49226.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49226.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/27/2013 02:44 UTC","Object Features":"Other","Date of the Event":"07/27/2013 10:33 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"cylinder shaped object with random flashing light"}
