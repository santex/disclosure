The object appeared at the horizon facing due north from state highway 240 about 1 mile north of downtown Burkburnett. As the object appeared it was a very bright white light but very small and consise. It seemed to move straight up and slowed as it climbed to what appeared to be an altitude of about 1 mile. As the object slowed to nearly a stop, the intensity seemed to die off. My immediate thought was some sort of fireworks. However it had no type of contrail. (smoke, sparks, fire) Then it increased in intensity and rapidly accelerated in a WNW direction of mostly the same altitude. It took almost no time (1 second?) to be completely out of sight. I am a paranormal investigator, (although mostly in other realms) not that it makes me any more credible, but I hear reports all the time. Right now I am completely dumbfounded and I really don't know what to think. Honestly as I watched, I got chill bumps and really just stood there with my mouth open. I'm really not sure what it was. I love star gazing, and about four or five days ago, I saw a shooting star. Minutes later out of the corner of my eye, I saw another light that was different in intensity and direction. It just looked weird. But I blew it off as another shooting star. This episode started in the same area of the sky."],"Date of the Event":"08/09/2010 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/10/2010 12:58 UTC","Case Number":"25050","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25050.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25050.html"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.105091"}
