I noticed them after looking up to see what was making noise in the tree. (It was a squirrel). They were about one hundred yards apart and I would estimate 1,000 ft. above the ground. I could not see waht was between them but it was darker than the rest of the sky so I assume thre was something there. They moved across the sky silently from the N.W. to the S.E. right over my house. They disappeared about three blocks from my house. I felt very nervous after i saw this but eventually calmed down and felt a kind of content feeling."],"Region":"Nebraska","Case Number":"9321","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01282008-0011","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Lincoln","There was one other sighting in Lincoln on or around October 15th 2007"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/15/2007 09:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-96.676379","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.808832,+-96.676379(9321)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9321) map </A>","Latitude":"40.808832","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Strange lights moving across the sky.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown"}
