Tried to look at it with binoculars, which were difficult to steady. Object was moving north or northeast, so it became lower on the horizon as I watched. Light was too bright and moved too fast to be a star. If I had to narrow down the description, I'd say I was watching flames from the back of a rocket of some kind - bright white to yellowish white, but red at the trailing end. If it was flames from a rocket, I could not see the rocket itself. Last week's sighting was at about 9 PM and it was farther west; tonight around 10 PM it was farther north. The International Space Station does occasionally pass overhead, but it only stays visible for a few minutes at a time, so this object was not the ISS. Never saw anything in the newspapers last week about such a sighting."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/16/2012 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.411136","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05172012-0005","Date Submitted":"05/17/2012 01:17 UTC"}
