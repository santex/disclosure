I then said oh a falling star..but it wastn't. These 2 red lights hovered for a second and flashed and then flashed as they whipped across the sky in a south easterly direction and then it was gone or at least out of site. It lasted approximately 10 seconds. My friend and I looked at each other and said \"did we just see what we saw? No one is going to believe us, but we saw it and said cheers glad we witnessed that.\" We both were ecstatic at what we saw. I checked my phone for the exact time and made a note."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37710.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37710.html"],"Longitude":"-97.847592","Case Number":"37710","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=55.750355,+-97.847592(37710)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37710) map </A>","Latitude":"55.750355","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"04/23/2012 11:23 UTC","Country":"Canada","Region":"Manitoba","Object Shape":"Flash","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"2 flashing red lights close together..flashed on spot then blinked & moved South","Log Number":"CA-04242012-0008","Tags":"City"}
