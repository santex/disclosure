It was so bright there was no missing it. We stopped the car in the parking lot and watched the light. It was staionary and looked as if the light was shining down through a fog. Neither of us knew what to think or had any idea what it was. As it was projecting down it suddenly went dark but the fog underneath continued to glow several seconds after the light went out. The sky was clear and there was no fog or clouds in the sky. We looked for it again all the way home but didn't see it again. I immediately started searching the internet when I got home and noticed that people in Connecticut, Virginia and New York seemed to be seeing the same thing we just saw."],"Summary":"Very bright white light shining down through a fog.
