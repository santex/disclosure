It looked like a extremely bright star (that shape) the outer color was blue but the inside of of it was bright white. within seconds the light became smaller and smaller till it turned into a dot. then it took of in high speeds into a direction. at first i thought i could have been a star from the very first second but right away and i mean right away i knew nothing was that huge and bright. It felt amazing, i enjoyed every second of it. I lost sight of the object after it flying to its whatever direction it was, the little dot light just disappeared. If anyone has seen this please please please email me. I want to know if anyone else has seen it."],"Summary":"Bright bright star looking light that turns into a extremely small dot then fly's away.","City":"Anaheim","Date of the Event":"11/19/2012 08:25 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
