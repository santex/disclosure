It was dark, but appeared to reflect light on the leading edge of the object. It was either really low and moved really slowly, or it was extremely large and moving very fast at a high altitude. It appeared to be very thin since as soon as it never blocked any visible stars. I tried to show a friend and he did not see it. I questioned what I saw, thinking it may be a large flock of birds flying in formation, but there was no variation to the shape."],"Latitude":"33.985949","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/30/2011 11:27 UTC","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Whittier","There were no other sightings in Whittier on or around March 29th 2011"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron, Triangle, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28478.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28478.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Summary":"Large dark object moved smoothly and silently.
