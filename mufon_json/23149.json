I noticed many white birds loitering at about 500-1000 ft. She looked for a second, then pointed out a 'white dot' that seemed motionless. I spotted it, and after about a minute it began moving slowly, taking an irregular path to the south. After another minute or two it stopped moving. After another 20-30 seconds the object moved again. Slowly, as before, but this time in more of an eastward direction. I watched for another 30-60 seconds, then I went inside the house to look for my binoculars, as the object was too far away to see any detail. When I emerged from the house, the object was gone. My girlfriend and daughter (10 yrs old) witnessed the object."],"City":"Coppell","Object Shape":"Circle","Longitude":"-97.013928","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/05/2010 08:21 UTC"}
