{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was getting ready to grill some hamburgers in our front yard when my 12 year old son asked what that was in the sky. I looked up and said I didn't know and quickly pulled out my phone to take a picture. When I first viewed the object it was at a high altitude above the tree level at one horizon. I took one picture and in that time it had covered nearly half of my viewable sky. I was able to take a second picture before it became unviewable, going past the tree line at the oposite horizon. This object was traveling very fast and had no noticeable wing span even when zooming in on the picture I took later. Simply put it looked like a pill tablet. My 12 year old son was also a witness to this."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Nixa","Summary":"No wings were observed on object. It was not plane shaped.
