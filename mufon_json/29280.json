{"divs":["sighting detailsi saw two other mufon reports of something similar in the chicago area recently so i will try and share the video and photos i have of it on this site. i have seen this gold, copper, orange sphere ufo several times during the day over the past month; 4\\29, 5\\22 and again yesterday may 27,2011 at 315pm cdt. i have also recorded this type of craft a few times before since 2009. i watched the slow moving sparkling gold morphing sphere of light noiselessly glide over the city for about 4 minutes. my camcorder is brand new hd sony but for some reason when i tried focusing in on the object the screen blurred or possibly the object was disapearing and re appearing. it started as a small point of light, it was east over the city then came west towards forest park. maybe this is what the other witnesses saw. *(moved to additional information section -- cms\\sg). thanks for reading."],"Latitude":"41.880996","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.80555","Date Submitted":"05/28/2011 03:39 UTC","Summary":"Gold sphere over Chicago 27 May 2011 UFO HD Video + Photos Uploaded on Youtube","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Diamond, Sphere, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.880996,+-87.80555(29280)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29280) map </A>","Region":"Illinois","Log Number":"US-05282011-0002","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29280.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29280_submitter_file1__ufochicagomay272011guttergawkeryoutube5.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29280_submitter_file2__ufochicagomay272011guttergawkeryoutube4.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29280_submitter_file3__ufochicagomay272011guttergawkeryoutube3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29280.html"],"City":"Forest Park","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/27/2011 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Forest Park","There were no other sightings in Forest Park on or around May 27th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"29280"}
