{"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["sighting detailsme and my friend dan l. were at walnut beach sky watching. we noticed a bright object in the early morning sky. we focused my videocamera on it, centered the object on the video cameras screen then paid no attention to it. we then talked about what we had seen ealier that night over the lake, then turned back to the camera and noticed that the object had moved. we continued to observe the object until it suddenly disappeared. we thought that the object could have been a star, or planet at first but quickly realized that the earth simply doesnt rotate fast enough to account for how far the object progressed across the sky, and even if it were a star or planet the path it would have followed acorss the sky would have been entirely different. we then thought about the idea of the object being a aircraft, however i did not see any anti-collision, wing, or landing lights that were blinking at a timed interval on this object. the object appeared to be pulsating with no predetermined order and flashing an array of colors. i further concluded that the object could not have been a aircraft because the object was heading in a eastern heading towards the rising sun that was in the sky. if after the object lights went off the sunlight would have reflected off of the aircrafts fuselage. i am former air force, and i have been around a lot of different airframes, and i've seen many different aircraft in the sky, and i can identify all of the airframes the usaf currently has in service, along with the majority of thoes in the civilan sector on sight. however this object doesnt appear to be any airframe i am familar with. let alone the object has a extremely low airspeed which in most cases the majority of aircraft would have a very hard time trying to stay airborn at such a low speed. anyways i eventually lost sight of the object when it suddenly disappeared from sight. i saw it disappear with my own eyes, an my friend saw it disappear on camera. we managed to capture the object disappearing on tape and we analyzed it frame by frame. i will be posting the videos link and the images link for the frame by frame breakdown below so you can see what we witnessed. video link: http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=bapdtd7ozqk frame by frame breakdown: http:\\\\s773.photobucket.com\\albums\\yy20\\robertg87\\?action=view���t=d6eae89c.pbw equipment: jvc everio with tripod"],"Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Longitude":"-80.787129","Sighting Duration":"00:05:09","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Ashtabula","There were no other sightings in Ashtabula on or around March 18th 2010"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.870883,+-80.787129(22423)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22423) map </A>","City":"Ashtabula","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22423.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22423.html"],"Latitude":"41.870883","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright Object Disappearing In The Sky","Log Number":"US-03212010-0010","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Ohio","Date Submitted":"03/21/2010 01:50 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/18/2010 07:05 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Other","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"22423","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
