I went inside to tell someone and then went back outside, and again these objects passed by again however this time the object on the left side flew off and did a manuver and returned into the formation again it only took them 2-3 seconds to travel across the entire sky, i heard that when a pilot crashes the airforce will do a flyby and one plane will fly off and return to formation these did the same thing however the speed is not a plane or satalite for these take a very long time to travel across the sky considering the simalrity to usa air force leads me to believe that these object are a black ops craft like an unmaned stealth craft like in the movie stealth but i have never seen a human craft travel so fast even our space ships going 40,000mph take a few minutes to travel across the entire sky"],"City":"Port Alberni","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
