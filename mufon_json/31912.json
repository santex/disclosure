I was 16 back then, and that night I was leaving the summer cottage. I locked the door, and as I was turning around i froze looking up: a glowing disc flew wobbling over my head and disappeared behind the houses and trees in 3 seconds. It made no noise, I only felt vibrations from it���s wobbling - it made ~10 one-two meter jumps side-to-side while flying straight. It's color was very outlandish, I guess between cyan and turquoise. After I lost sight of the object I rushed to the gates where my brother was waiting in the car. I asked if he saw a UFO, but he didn't. That evening I told my parents about what I saw. And then I buried this event in my memory for a few years before telling my friends and other people. Note 1: I made an illustration from a recently taken photo. Note 2: Object wasn't flying fast, but it's rapid wobbling made it hard to see the details of the surface, but it definitely wasn't smooth. Note 3: I have had a number of UFO sightings (orbs of light) in the recent years, and I saw what looked like two stars shooting light beams at each other when I was about 5 or 6."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"23.851413","City":"JÃÂ«rmala","Region":"","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=56.984118,+23.851413(31912)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31912) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"31912","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"LV-09192011-0010","Summary":"Glowing flying saucer","Latitude":"56.984118","Date Submitted":"09/19/2011 09:17 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31912.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31912_submitter_file1__jurmalaUFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31912.html"],"Country":"Latvia"}
