My impression is that it may have been a weapons test from a military installation, a satellite launch, a Meteor, or some space junk falling from the sky or maybe something unexplainable.I know it was brightly visable to thousands of people so my daughter and I can't be the only people to observe this object.Maybe somebody else saw this from a different angle and got a better observation."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball","Longitude":"-93.211384","Object Flight Path":"Other","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Branson","There were no other sightings in Branson on or around October 3rd 2011"],"Date Submitted":"10/04/2011 01:28 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"36.644673","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10042011-0005"}
