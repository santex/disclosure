i didnt see anything besides traveling lights and the best i can figure is that it might be satellites of the space station i hope!! i felt very much like a bacteria in a petrie dish tonight, any explanation would be welcomed and weighed.. \\p.s. this is the first time i have been compelled to report this but its not the first of these i've seen these here.. it was just that there were so many last night it kinda worried me a bit..."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Paris","There were no other sightings in Paris on or around October 30th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.660143,+-95.576638(33000)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33000) map </A>","Latitude":"33.660143","City":"Paris","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
