We both noticed what we thought a star, but we both comented on how bright it seemed. Then it slowly backed away and faded out with no sound. a few days later I was taking out some trash at the hospital and noticed a dark object in on spot over the lake,very high in the air. This evnt was in the late afternoon. I pointd it out to several people. I watched it for a few minutes seening if it may have been a plane, but I am sure it was not an aircraft as I was rasied and still live by an Air force base. I turned my back for a few seconds and it was gone when I turned back. I kind of felt like I was being watched. You may want to check this part of the country out sometime. I have seen a few strange things living here that I could not find an answear for in the sky both day and night. \"T B\""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10692.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10692.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10692.html"],"City":"Medford","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-122.867415","Case Number":"10692"}
