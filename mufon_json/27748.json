This is not the first thing that we have seen back in Aug. we were out side when 7 bright lights went across the sky going the same way and then around 4am my wife had told me that she had seen another light that was low to the ground with no sound so she says it could not be a plane. Then abuot a week ago I was out in me yard when I saw a bright light flash like a crama flash but it was way to high. that one was by the little dipper."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"bright green flash","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Michigan","City":"Midland"}
