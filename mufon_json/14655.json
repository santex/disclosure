I saw and heard nothing as it was very far away, I've seen one of these things every night since then, It seems to be regular. it has moved closer and farther very slowly, it has moved up and down as well at 1-5 mph, It was too far away to see such details as fine shape other than from my vantage point in my 2nd story room. there seems to be something that it watches 30-50 miles in that direction, possibly the Doylestown airport. but I'm not familiar to that area. or maybe the air force base a bit farther. each time I saw the object I eventually stop watching, but It tends to take around 30-45 minutes to move across the window. but it seems to move reguarly."],"Case Number":"14655","Log Number":"US-01012009-0001","Sighting Duration":"00:20:30","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.316196,+-75.123794(14655)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14655) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14655.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14655.html"],"City":"Doylestown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.316196","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Doylestown","There were no other sightings in Doylestown on or around November 25th 2002"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
