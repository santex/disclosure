I was looking at the stars and all of a sudden 5 bright star like objects traveling at high speed traveled in my view area. These were not conventional aircraft. They were separate vehicles moving at a very high rate of speed. I have been in aviation for 34 years and the only word I can use to describe them is \"Wow\". They appeared to be in a formation. It reminded me of a fighter group except at the altitude I believe they were at they would have to be traveling i. Excess of 3000 miles per hour. No sound whatsoever. I was amazed at the speed and coordination. They did not manuever or turn but they were so tight and quick I let out an \"Holy Sh*t\" Again I have an extensive background in aviation and whatever these were they surely were not anything that I am aware of in existense in this worlds inventory of aircraft civilian or military."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"5 bright object flying in sync.
