I watched it for 10 min and it did not move. When i was about to go inside the light started to deam and took off to the west. I run and grab my husband so he could see it. When I came back outside the light was back in the same place and very bright again. But this time there was something smaller coming from the ground up to the ufo. As the smaller one got close both of them lost there light but you could still see them. They both took off, only the smaller one went north and the bigger one went back west and did this 5 or 6 times. When I saw the big one again it looked as if it turned really fast and was heading north. Right at that time all the lights went out and you could not see it anymore. I wish everyone could have seen this. It was amazing."]}
