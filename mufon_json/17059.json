It was a clear night with many stars. I was looking up to the north and noticed a Very bright orb which appeared to be hovering.At first I thought it was a bright star or planet then relaized it was to low to be one. It was some distance away and about 10000 ft high. I thought maybe a shooting star. It hovered for about 45 seconds and then speed away and was gone in 7 seconds. It shot straight up into the sky, I watched as it just faded away in about 7 seconds. Shooting stars fall, this actually went higher in the sky until I could no longer see it."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05222009-0006"}
