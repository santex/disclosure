At tree height level from my view point. I viewed object for 10 minutes before getting my Brother in law to view the object as well. I woke my wife as well to watch. We grabbed the binoculars and saw the object was 4-5 lights obviously manufactured not natural. the object started to change configuration form a circular pattern to a linear one.either moving away or losing altitude slowly the object abruptly changed direction to the north and moved away in a deliberate matter. My brother in law felt this was at a significant speed, I felt it was more slow rolling. I was using the binoculars at the time. we live on a river with an island between us and the other shore. this island is fully wooded and was the tree line that we observed the object over."],"Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/09/2012 12:00 UTC"}
