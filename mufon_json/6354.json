{"Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsLast summer the space station flew over chicago at the time indicated. Not knowing what to see I was looking for any thing that moved. My house faces south, in my frt. yard I look up and saw a star like object moving at a good speed. I thought this was it and came back in then I saw the time was off so I went back out and saw the real shuttle go over head. The news media interviewed a man who had pictures of the object(three orbs) but that was the end of the interview. The station was abc 7 or nbc 5. This has troubled me as to what I saw. The star object I saw was so farr away all it looked lkie was a star but not a shooting star. This one moved left to right in a Z patteren and went out of sight."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/30/2006 09:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6354.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6354.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Space shuttle fly over and a sighting.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.883124,+-87.621048(6354)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6354) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Chicago","Log Number":"US-02092007-0005","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Region":"Illinois","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around June 30th 2006"],"Longitude":"-87.621048","Latitude":"41.883124","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"06/30/2006 09:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"6354","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
