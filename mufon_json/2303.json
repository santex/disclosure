It proceded to follow the same path a tornado took one year previous.It came without sound but, the Palmeto bugs that were making their eveningsounds that were deafening, all stopped instantly.It was a warm evening withcool breezes, temp around 70 degres and a completely clear night sky, you couldsee every star. Our home sat in open fields so, I had a clear view ofeverything. The saucer stayed on path, traveling at about 5 mph. When it wasdirectly overhead I felf completely at peace and my heart felt up-lifted. Thesaucer glowed yet the only thing I noticed moving on it was a gold ball withtail circling ever so slowly around its perimeter. I loss sight of the objectwhen it went far enough west to be below the treeline."]}
