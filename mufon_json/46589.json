I immediately assumed it was \"Chinese lanterns\" and traveled to my destination. In less than 10 min I headed back to my house and attempted to locate the objects again. They were gone. There were no trace of them anywhere. The lights did not flicker and I have found similar formations on the internet that looked very similar to what I saw."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04042013-0008","City":"Albany","Latitude":"42.657777","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.657777,+-73.764701(46589)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46589) map </A>","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Albany","There were no other sightings in Albany on or around October 8th 2012"]}
