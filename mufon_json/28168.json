{"Log Number":"US-03082011-0014","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my back porch when I noticed what appeared to be a large star where none should be. I stared at it, as it appeared to be in an air traffic lane (2 planes were passing it at the time). It stayed relatively in one place, moving a little, randomly. It seemed to flicker, with red. After about 20 minutes, first one, and then another, similar light appeared, moving from roughly south to north, disappearing within a minute or two. After another maybe 5 minutes the first light moved a bit south and has been very slowly either getting smaller or moving away. It can still be seen."],"Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There was one other sighting in New York on or around March 8th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Other","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"03/08/2011 09:10 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/08/2011 10:22 UTC","Case Number":"28168","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.717353,+-73.999563(28168)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28168) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Star-like object, moving randomly, seems to flicker - mostly white, a little red.","Latitude":"40.717353","City":"New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28168.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28168.html"],"Longitude":"-73.999563","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York"}
