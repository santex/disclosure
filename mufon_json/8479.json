Looked up and saw off in the distance what looked like the shape of a man very high near the clouds north of us. My first thought was that someone was parachuting in since that happens here in the summers. I was waiting to watch the parachutist drop into town but instead it went up and disappeared into the clouds. Minutes later it dropped out of clouds again and seemed to hover for a good thirty minutes. I had time to go get binoculars and sight on it. We all took turns watching through binoculars for thirty to forty minutes until it went far enough up and away that we could not see it anymore. I could only explain it as looking like a balloon from the Macy's parade that got away."],"Latitude":"57.058366","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Alaska","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8479.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8479.html"],"Longitude":"-135.32202","City":"Sitka","Summary":"Man shape","Date Submitted":"05/31/0001 05:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=57.058366,+-135.32202(8479)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8479) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"05/31/0001 05:00 UTC","Tags":"City"}
