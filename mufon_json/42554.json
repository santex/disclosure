Object went straight up and disappeared.It appeared to wink on then wink back out again. It looked similar to a Fourth of July \"mortar\" dud, but just briefly winked on then immediately off. Had similar sighting night before which wife will file separately. I called my wife to the door, but due to a disability, she could not get there fast enough. Only lasted about a minute."]}
