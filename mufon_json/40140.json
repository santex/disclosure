I was paralized but could see the being. It did only one thing and that was to tickle me. I laughed so much i couldn't breath. The being left through the window. Passing thought it rather than opening it. It was grey and had stringy hair, not what we have but horse tail like. It came back 2 more times. Always the same ,only for what I can describe as amusement more than anything. A military Canadian service man lived not to far away and said he saw a craft that corresponds with the times. He will remain unavailable always due to his service to the Canadian military. I didn't imagine this, until now i've had no one to tell. Well I'm telling and don't care if you believe me or not."],"Tags":"City"}
