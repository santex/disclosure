I had just finished turning around and was heading south when a bright, irridescent, twinkling, multicolored varying light caught my attention out of the east (left) of me. I thought it might be an incoming airplane as I do live next to a local airport. I found it strange that the light was completely stationary and vanished rather quickly. It appeared too bright to be a plane. I'm not sure why, but aloud I stated \" i see you\". I found it strange that I said this because initally i did not know it was there. I observed this light for approximately 20 seconds and lost it at a turn in the road. Upon resuming the southerly direction, I again tried to look for it but it was gone."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Region":"Massachusetts","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
