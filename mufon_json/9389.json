If I had not looked up I would have never know it came by it was totaly silent if there was noise it was plenty close to hear it.It was round and had a dull silver white glow to it. It did not streak in with a tail like a meteor it was moving from east to west not that far from the ground.I now know why their are so few photos of these things if I had a camera in my hand there is still no way I could have reacted."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02012008-0008","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"Oklahoma","Object Features":"None","Summary":"disk shape pale white glow","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.009352","Longitude":"-97.084777","City":"Undisclosed"}
