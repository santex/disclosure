When I downloaded the picture onto my computer I noticed a blue ball in the sky left of the sun that was behind some clouds, the blue ball has a purple tail behind it. Any idea's what this could be? The picture was taken close to Heber City Utah. If you drag the picture to your desktop and zoom in on it you san see it very well. My wife and I did not notice the object in the sky until I downloaded the photo onto my computer"],"Object Shape":"Circle"}
