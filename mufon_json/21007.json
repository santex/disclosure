{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving from Comanche to Dublin and had noticed two planes that seemed odd in that they were flying parallel to each other, about 5 inches at my extended arms length. I continued to watch them to see if they would diverge. They were almost becoming imperceptable to the eye, when suddenly, in the same area of the sky, two huge lights just came on. In comparison to the planes, or whatever the first lights were, these were enormous! It was almost like headlights, yet in the sky. Both came on at the same time, and I had long enough to look closely, assure myself they were there and were not glare, and then at the same time both disappeared. They never reappeared, and I continued my drive home in about 15 minutes. I don't see how anyone else on the highway traveling East, as I was, could have missed seeing something so obviously out of the normal."],"Latitude":"32.088443","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dublin","There were no other sightings in Dublin on or around December 15th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.088443,+-98.337348(21007)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21007) map </A>","Longitude":"-98.337348","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21007.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21007.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/15/2009 10:28 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"21007","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date of the Event":"12/15/2009 07:30 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Dublin","Log Number":"US-12152009-0014","Summary":"Two huge lights in the night sky"}
