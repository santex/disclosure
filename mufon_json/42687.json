{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsOkay so I was trying to fall asleep and heard a helicopter. I normally look to see what they're up to anyways, and this helicopter sounded really close to my house like it was flying over my roof. So when I look out the window I see the helicopter chasing a light blue sphere across the sky and they were bookin it. It was amazing. I tried to wake up my boyfriend but he was fast asleep and by the time he woke up angrily all he could hear was a faint helicopter propellers. They were both right above tree tops and this light in comparison to a helicopter was the same size as it. I have seen a couple unidentifiable objects since living in the Motherlode area, and it is really interesting to me. I am glad I got to see it. Hopefully next time I can get some footage."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/09/2012 10:30 UTC","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Saturn-like, Sphere, Star-like","Date Submitted":"09/20/2012 11:19 UTC","Summary":"Helicopter chasing blue light","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"38.13742","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42687.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42687.html"],"Case Number":"42687","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.13742,+-120.459644(42687)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42687) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09202012-0019","City":"Murphys","Longitude":"-120.459644","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Murphys","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
