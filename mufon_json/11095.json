{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was sitting in a lawn chair on a levy that created two small lakes in the middle of crop fields. the lakes are about 1 mile west of fort branch, indiana. because of the levy, i was elevated compared to the fields and land that is in view all around me. the sky is big here. the sky reached to the horizons which are miles away. there was unlimited view that night. no trees or buildings blocking any view. its a great spot for sky gazing. ive been out there a few times just for this purpose. i had found the lakes and decided to take my fishing pole with me so i could see if there were any fish in the lake as i was sky gazing. i had baited my hook and cast my line. i was sitting in a lawn chair paying attention to my pole and line expecting to get some fishing action when suddenly a bright light that was above my field of view shined on me. it reflected off my glasses and things got just a bit brighter close around me as if i was in a beam of light. i instantly look up and seen a bright light that appeared to be a spot light. the first thought that popped in my mind the instant the light hit me was that someone, maybe the farmer who owned the land i was on had shined a spot light on me to see me and what i was doing. as soon as i seen the source of the light i knew that wasnt the case. the light was at a high altitude moving at about the speed that planes fly through here. it was moving from the south to the north. it shined on me for about 15 seconds than slowly got dimmer going from bright white to a flame orange than it went dark. after that i couldnt see it anymore. it was just gone. i didnt hear any noise from it but there were frogs in the lake and they probably would have drowned out any noise that it would have made if it was. my feelings were of a little confusion. the questions and thoughts that went through my head were... 1.was that a helicopter? i dont think so. although helicopters can fly that high. ive never seen one that high around here. also if it were searching for something or someone the light would have been useless at that altitude and speed. 2. was that a plane? it was moving at the right speed for one. it was at an altitude that a lot of planes fly around here. but... again what good would a spot light be at that altitude and speed. if a plane did have a spot light why would it shine to the side and rear of it. when the spot light went out why couldnt i see running lights. 3.was that a meteor. ive seen a lot of meteors but never one like that. it was way too slow. it was bigger than any meteor ive seen. it didnt leave a trail. it wasnt falling. it was flying at a straight and level flight. 4. i cant say it wasnt man made or a normal natural occurance but i just dont think it was. it was very unusual and ive never seen anything like it before. it did appear to be shining on me. i did feel a sense of being watched. please dont get me wrong. i wasnt sitting in a round area of bright light hitting me and the ground. the light came on suddenly as if a switch was flipped and it did reflect off of my glasses and it did make me and my things easier for me to see. anyway i thought this was unusual enough to share with you. i am wondering if other people has seen this."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/02/2008 10:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"spot light in the sky","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.251156,+-87.581133(11095)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11095) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11095.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11095.html"],"Longitude":"-87.581133","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fort Branch","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06082008-0007","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"11095","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Fort Branch","Date of the Event":"06/02/2008 10:00 UTC","Latitude":"38.251156","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Indiana"}
