It was 2151 and I was sitting on the porch playin words with friends. It was a cold and absolutly clear night, looked up at sky to the north and there was a solid red light at about the height that airplanes travel. It didn't have the strobing lights on it like a plane. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed, I tried to get my video recorder on my phone turned on in time but it was going to quickly. It made no sound at all and went from the northern sky all the way to it was out of sight in the southeastern sky in around 14 seconds. I was so excited at seeing this and so bummed none of my nieghbors were outside. I facebooked that I had just seen a UFO and sent sent a multi-text message to some of my friends. Unfortunatly the majority of them did not share my in excitement. I will continue to look up and look forward to my next encounter!!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle, Unknown","Region":"Arkansas","Log Number":"US-11132012-0009","Source":"MUFON"}
