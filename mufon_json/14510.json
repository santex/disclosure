{"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsAround 8:58pm in Northern San Juan Capistrano area. A clear night, 52 degress. Overlooking the hills from north san juan towards dana point. I saw a silent object about a mile south hovering over beyond a hill with red and blue lights. Could not make out the shape. But it was silent. It had a spot light like a helicopter. But it was swaying the spot light around in circles slowly. Going clockwise, then counter clockwise, clockwise then counter again. The spotlight was so bright that it illuminated the entire hill. For about a minute. But no noise from the object. It seemed like very unusal activity for a helicopter if it was one. But then again, it was silent."],"Latitude":"33.505573","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14510.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14510.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in San Juan Capistrano","There were no other sightings in San Juan Capistrano on or around December 23rd 2008"],"Log Number":"US-12242008-0001","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/23/2008 08:57 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.661001","Case Number":"14510","City":"San Juan Capistrano","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.505573,+-117.661001(14510)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14510) map </A>","Summary":"Silent hovering object with swaying spotlight.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/23/2008 08:57 UTC"}
