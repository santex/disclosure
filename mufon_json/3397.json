My then wife and I were on the Lake Worth fishing pier, when we saw a round beach ball sized craft approach from the north, about 50 feet offshore, at about 100 feet, and disappered southbound. It make no noise. generated no air waves, and we both looked at each other and said, Did you see that.\" We both did, and as far as I know, we never spoke of this to anyone. I am a former newspaper reporter, TV Correspondent, and am a Florida licensed private investigator. It was truly, the strangest event in my lifetime.
