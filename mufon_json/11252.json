so at 3:00 am or so, it was a friday . he was a musician and got off work about 2:00 in the morning. i was sitting on the hood of my car eating a pack of m&m's looking down this road i had lived on for 3 years or so (i lived there from about 11 to 14 years old and had spent many nights walking this street. in those days it was not dangerous.)i had just gotten my drivers licence at 15 ( a hardship licence ) i was looking at what i thought was an arial antena light that i thought must surely have just been installed. but it looked strange the light was kind of big for an arial light and the light did not glow. you know streams of light from the light. it was about 1 and 1\\4 a mile and a few feet from me. as i looked i thought i'm going to get closer to it and while still looking at it i started to move off the hood of my car. as i slid to the edge of the hood it started moving slowly and smoothly to the left of my position. at that point still looking at it i kind of freaked and jumped off the hood when i did it started moving just a little faster. at first i just stared at it for a minute. then for some unknown reason to me i decided to follow it. i guess being 15 years old and somewhat wild in nature i did not realize that it could have been dangerous. it was not. that side of town was set up in a large rectangular grid. from 61st to 66th the streets were and are about 2 miles long, at one end the cross street is west port arthur road. at the other is jade rd. the sreet crossing in the middle is garnet ave i believe. i was sitting on 65th facing jade in between west port arthur and garnet. almost dirrectly center between the two roads. as i took off following it, it went towards 64th on my left. i went down to jade and turned left, i saw it slowly moving passed 64th and 63rd and then it went below the trees. i drove down and turned left down 63rd. then left on garnet then left again on 64th. i saw it again then and it flew kind of in a circle ( not exactly but it vered around me.) when it came around again it went below the trees and came up closer to me. at that point i got the distinct feeling it was playing hide and seek with me. it flew up a little higher and flew west toward dick dowling elementary school. i followed it out there and lost contact or my visual of it. i was on the road next to the school, the south side. i got out of my car and stood on the running board with one elbow on the roof and one elbow on the top of the door and i looked around in the sky for a while, a minute anyway. i looked right above me and about 2 to 3 miles straight above me it was just sitting in the sky. as i stared it, it just took off west at what can only be light speed. it disapeared not behind anything, but in about 1 second it went so fast in that direction it got to small for me to see and left me looking around for it, for about 7 or 8 seconds. then it came back from exactly the opposite direction, or like it had went around the earth once and stopped at the same spot exactly. and when it stopped it had no wobble, like you might expect something moving that fast to have when it stopped. it scared me at that point and i took off. but i was not the kind of kid that scared easy. and as you might imagine no one believed me. my brother said it might have been something nasa was working with, (nasa was only about 100 miles away in houston.) and the reason we don't see it in the papers is it is secret or it is just to expensive to run. but i do not believe what i saw was man made. and if it is a man made craft i can tell you now that man and probably woman have been out of this solor system and probably at least fairly deep into this galaxy. and maybe way out of this galaxy. it was not man made, it was to small for a man in the first place and if it was remote control our technology is very advanced. much more than anything the common man can imagine. reguardless of where the technology comes from, again i think it was alien made and alien run."],"Date of the Event":"09/10/1974 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"11252","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line
