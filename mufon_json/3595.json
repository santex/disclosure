I was using the LCD back for composing my photos. Later that week I was looking back through the photos on the computer when I noticed a strange object in the sky in one of compositions. Zooming in, it looked a lot like the classic saucer shape at an angle moving just fast enough to blur a little. I never heard anything. I never saw the event. I saved the file, untouched, to my computer and also recorded the exif data which I used to reference time and date of the occurance."],"City":"Tucson","Region":"Arizona"}
