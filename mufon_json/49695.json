They almost formed the shape of the little dipper but it wasn't completely dark yet and they were too close. Plus the formation was a bit off, one was very close to the horizon and ruined the shape. There were no other stars in the sky and these were just glowing so bright. We thought it might be like a string of lights together, really big lights. They seemed like they were in such a formation, like they were connected but not. We stared at them as we were driving. They just looked so interesting. Glowing really bright. Whitish yellow. They didn't move at all. Just hovered. They seemed really interesting, like it was hard to look away. We were so curious as to what they were, we backtracked on the highway but they disappeared. It was so disappointing because they were just there and so big and close to the ground."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","City":"Pittsburgh","Log Number":"US-08102013-0034","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49695.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49695.html"],"trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There was one other sighting in Pittsburgh on or around August 10th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
