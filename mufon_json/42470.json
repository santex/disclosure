It was very hard without a tripod to keep it in focus but it was there. We left during the sighting but as we were walking back it was still rising upward into the sky. Swamp gas could not hover and we saw it hovering then move left and right then continue upwards against the wind. The wind would have been carrying it towards the north east not the northwest which is the main direction it followed. It also disappeared and flashed but i did not have it in focus except one time whenever it did this."],"Region":"Illinois","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
