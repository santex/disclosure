I noticed that one of the stars appeared to be moving. I watched it for around a minute or so then it just disappeared? ? I would class myself as a normal guy however this did slightly freak me out a little. I do t understand where it went!! I guess the direction from me was more south east east, possibly heading to Edinburgh. However as it was too far away its unknown whether this was in the sky or out in space. Was just like a bright white light, much the same as how a star would look in the night sky, yet it just disappeared? ?"]}
