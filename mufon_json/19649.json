Walked south 100 feet to end of driveway and saw fireball heading south-east towards Toronto. Sparks were flying from tail-end, very bright. Heard a sort of fizzing during sighting, and faint sort of thunder sound could be heard after object could no longer be seen. Lost sight because of large tree-line in the south. Estimate size as about twice as big as my thumbnail at arm's length."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19649.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19649.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/25/2009 09:05 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Orangeville","There were no other sightings in Orangeville on or around September 25th 2009"],"Log Number":"CA-09252009-0021","Object Shape":"Fireball","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Canada","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ontario","Case Number":"19649","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-80.094311","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"09/25/2009 10:46 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
