I seen that it slowly moved left to right, then up and down, maintaining the same speed through out, no sound. I asked my neighbor \"what is that\". He noticed it as well. He didnt pay too much attention to it, he resumed talking to me. I would look up every so often and it was still there. Im not sure how high it was, but it seemed like a long ways away, and it seemed big from the distance. I looked up one last time and didnt see it anymore. I reported the sighting to the Mufon in NC. I just listened to the Mufon trafic report with Roger Marsh, and he mentioned another witness in NC that seen something similar. Different dates for the sighting, but im sure the same object from the description."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown"}
