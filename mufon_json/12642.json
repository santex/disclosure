Just I take a photo with my mobile phone, not good quality, in a day out with my family in s little village in Guadalajara (Spain) and later saw something I cant explain. I would appreciate if someone give some explanation about this. I didnt see it with my naked eyes when I made the photo. Maybe too much light reflected by the the cloud for the eye. I include another photo taken in the same place, moment and device to compare. The main photo is Image(2). The other is another photo taken almost in the same time. Thank you very much for your time and sorry for my english. If you need further details, dont hesitate to contact me."],"Log Number":"ES-09192008-0008","Summary":"hard to explain.
