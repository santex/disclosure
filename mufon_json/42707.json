We both observed it and were speechless as we both knew that it was not a plane as it hovered motionless, pulsating and emitting what appeared to be rays of light, especially from the bottom of the sphere. It was star-like, and we felt that it was nearer to us than the moon itself, and seemed to be no more than a couple of miles away. We raced home to go into the backyard to try and set up the telescope, but the trees blocked our view."],"Longitude":"-71.470623","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Rhode Island","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Warwick","There were no other sightings in Warwick on or around September 19th 2012"]}
