That is when I first saw this. It was like a small light. I ignored it and then it caught my attention becoming closer and looking like a hot air balloon and then it became further and then turned into a light again.. I showed my grandfather and he too thought it was odd. We left the game and on the way home we saw it again. It was a light, kind of amber orange, then it was near the moon and moved above it and then it changed into two strobing lights that blinked and moved rapidly in a strange pattern. It disappard once we went through some heavy trees and we did not see it again."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19004.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19004.html"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"19004","Object Shape":"Circle, Teardrop","Log Number":"US-09012009-0008","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.99385,+-86.437602(19004)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19004) map </A>","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Bowling Green","There were no other sightings in Bowling Green on or around August 28th 2009"],"Longitude":"-86.437602","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/28/2009 09:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"The UFO was at first a light then changed into balloon like w/ light then changed again into just a light disappearing and reappearing later","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Kentucky","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","Latitude":"36.99385"}
