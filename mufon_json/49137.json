I got up out of my chair to look at it better at first I thought it was an airplane with a engine on fire but then as I looked closer it was pulsating red orange vertical lights and I felt might hair stand on end and goosebumps all over almost like lightening in area and a feeling there was something more there . I then ran out my front door and observed the light just going behind trees and a second coming into view going same pace as first which I also lost sight of behind trees . They were both heading in a north northeast to south direction and I heard no noise coming from them . It was a very cloudy night no moon or stars showing at time ."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"I observed two red orange pulsating lights evenly spaced apart and moving at equal pace from NE to S direction","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49137.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49137.html"],"trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Middletown","There were no other sightings in Middletown on or around July 20th 2013"],"Case Number":"49137","City":"Middletown","Longitude":"-74.500315"}
