It sounded like a homing beacon if that makes sense, but loud and so defined it resembled being under water. The next tone was directly over my house and so loud my cats ran and hid. The next one sound like the first ad if fading off in the direction of flight. Homing beacon??? What makes that noise in the sky?? At 4 am???? I couldn't get up and look because it took less than 10 seconds to hear all 3 consecutive blurps. After it went over I was too afraid to move but got the time off my phone. I'm still shocked."],"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51699.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51699.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.842803,+-84.264238(51699)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51699) map </A>","Latitude":"37.842803","Summary":"LOUD beeping noise","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/21/2013 04:34 UTC","Longitude":"-84.264238","Log Number":"US-10212013-0005","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
