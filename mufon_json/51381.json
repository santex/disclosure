One orb was higher then the other but they were pretty close together. the lower orb on the right side I noticed had a little bit of a white light. Being near the airport I know what aircraft lights look like and that the air traffic controller wouldnt let 2 commercial aircraft get that close a few miles from the airport. To be certain I opened up my flight radar app on my phone while driving to check knwon commerical flights around the airport and there was none. I wanted to pull over to shoot a video or take a pic but I was running late for work. For the 30 seconds I was in view of them they didnt flash or move or make noise."],"Log Number":"US-10082013-0007","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-73.204852","Date Submitted":"10/08/2013 08:23 UTC","City":"Burlington","Region":"Vermont","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
