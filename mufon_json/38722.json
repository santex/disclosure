I looked at my friend Michael and said \"what is that?\" he looked up and his mouth just dropped we stared at it in silence for a few minutes. I knew It wasn't anything I could explain or had ever seen before. It was hovering and then all of a sudden it took off to the south east and was gone within a matter of seconds. When it was gone michael and I just stated at each other in amazement. Then we got excited. It was so close and noticeable we thought someone else had to have seen that. We called a couple local news stations to see if they had heard any other reports. And when nothing turned up we tried to google a UFO research organization and we called one but they never called us back."],"Summary":"Bright red pulsating form hovering then took off in the blink of an eye","Log Number":"US-06012012-0012","Object Shape":"Fireball","Region":"Arizona","Case Number":"38722"}
