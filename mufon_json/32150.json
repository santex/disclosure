At 5:40 AM, Wednesday September 28, 2011 I looked up at my favorite constellation Orion and I wittnessed 2 star like objects flying South at a incredible speed. The objects were also flying in-formation, side by side. 3 seconds is all it took the the objects to move from the 12:00 position ( over head ) to the 2:00 position and then went out of sight past the horizon. I estimate there speed at somewere between 2000 - 3000 MPH. No Sonic boom was heard so I figure the object had to be in the outer atmosphere, flying at even greater speeds."],"City":"Sacramento","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
