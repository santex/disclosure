I noticed the object because it was so bright. We couldn't make out an actual object, but what made it so noticeable was how bright it was and how fast it was moving. It crossed the entire skyline in a straight line in about 4 seconds at what seemed like an amazingly fast rate of speed and made no sound at all. It also had what was like a long white tail that was probably half as long as the entire skyline. We all stood up to look around because we couldn't believe what we saw. We lost sight of the object when it left our point of view to the west. It was a clear sky without the moon having risen yet. And, it was just very vivid compared to the other objects in the sky that night. We could see the big dipper perfectly above our heads and planes flying overhead much much higher than this object was."],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
