I saw what appears to be a star, but it is dimming and then getting brighter. I took out my binoculars and the object is rapidly flashing between the colors, green, blue, red, and gold. There is no repition, or order to the flashing, and the duration seems unsteady as well. The object appears to be stationary, not moving any direction. I have seen this type of object before, but never this bright or this close. I was in the U.S. Army Air Defense Artillary, so I am familiar with FAA and military flight lighting sequences, and this object does not follow that. I would be very interested to know what this object is so if you have any idea, please letme know, whether it is something signicant or mundane."],"Longitude":"-97.884743","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.883182","Date of the Event":"08/30/2012 11:44 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/31/2012 01:07 UTC","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42164.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42164.html"],"Log Number":"US-08312012-0003","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
