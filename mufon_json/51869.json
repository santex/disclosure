The orb hovered in one place for about an hour while it changed many different colors and appeared to change shape. After hovering for an hour the UFO took off behind a tree line a lot faster than a plane could go. We took 3 pretty cool videos and I have almost twenty pictures. All of my pictures and videos are time stamped because they were taken with my cell phone"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
