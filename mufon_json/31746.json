It was stationary in the sky but each time we went out it was in a different place. we watched the object from about 9p.m. until around 1a.m. We go outside to have a cigarette as we dont smoke in our home so we would look for it each time we went out. Without a compas i can only estimate location but when we saw it was in the western,north western,northern and then again in the western sky. this was in a matter of about 4 or 5 hours and we never actually saw it moving."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.498909,+-76.252188(31746)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31746) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/11/2011 04:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-76.252188","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Summary":"starlike object in the sky which shimmered red,yellow,blue and green light. appeared stationary but appeared in different areas at different times","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mexico","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"31746","Latitude":"43.498909","City":"Mexico","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31746.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31746.html"],"Log Number":"US-09112011-0016"}
