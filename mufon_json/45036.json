We had been shooting fireworks and noticed a bright light similar to search light on helicopter but it was way to high to be searching and had no sound. I thought it was a firework of some kind at first but it didn't explode. Then we thought it might be a plane but there were no runways nearby and it had no red and green flashing lights on it. It was going through the sky a good bit faster than an airplane too but it was flying under the clouds. It just flew south to north and went out of sight behind some trees. We were skeptical but none of us had ever seen any thing like it before. It was interesting none the less."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
