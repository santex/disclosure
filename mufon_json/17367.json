The object was very close to me so i just sat there staring in absolute disbelief, until it flew away at very high speeds, speeds that can not be reached in any man made aircraft, after 3-5 seconds."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date Submitted":"06/06/2009 10:40 UTC","City":"Wheatfield","Object Features":"None"}
