But once it got in to a random house. The lights begin flicking yellow. Then it permanently turned yellow. Then a green beam came out of the bottom. A green light emitted from the house's windows. I checked the house for any lifeforms. they was long gone. The next day they was back. ((The humans)). I noticed it by it making a Loud whooosh sound (Maybe coming from a wormhole or something) When the green beam came out. a large noise occurred. (It sounded like a Car hitting another car, with a explosion). The ship then mysteriously vanished. Most likely use of a cloaking device."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Insignia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.900602,+-77.029956(19784)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19784) map </A>"}
