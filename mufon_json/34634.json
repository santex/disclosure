{"Country":"United States","trends":[],"divs":["sighting detailsit was 5:30am and i was out in my back yard in the coastal community of solana beach, ca. i've never star gazed at that hour before, but i was looking for some meteors before getting ready for work. it was a real clear sky and i was excited to see several meteors but then all of a sudden from the west came this shape of blurry white\\yellow lights in the shape of a boomerang with space between each light. at first i thought it must be a flock of birds because of its shape ( that is the only thing i could think of making that type of shape in the sky) but i couldn't understand how it would be glowing. and why would there be darkness between the lights as if every other bird was lite up. but as it went over my head i realized these weren't birds. my brain was trying to process what i was seeing and come up with a rational explanation, but i have none. there were 5 lights but they were blurry glowing like behind a mist and i watched it go right over my head and to the east in a straight path until it disappeared. i have no idea how high it was, except to say that it wasn't like looking at a jet way up high. it was much closer than that. and much larger. it took about 6 seconds for it to pass. i was in complete shock as to what i had just seen. i had wished more than anything that my husband had been outside with me, but he was sound asleep. i am not one to have ever visited this or any other ufo site, but i have talked to several people about what i saw and one of them told me about this web site. i checked the local news when i got home, but no one reported anything, but then again neither did i. so if someone out there can give me an explanation as to what it could of been i would love it."],"Date Submitted":"01/05/2012 08:24 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01052012-0019","Latitude":"36.784001","Longitude":"-119.414452","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"34634","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Saw lights in the shape of a flock of birds or boomerang coming from the west heading east that glowed in a misty sort of way.","Date of the Event":"01/04/2012 05:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.784001,+-119.414452(34634)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34634) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34634.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34634.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
