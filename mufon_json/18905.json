I continued to try to relocate the craft, if that's what it was,but it was gone...we were so excited we discussed it, ad nauseum all the way thru the store and back home again...to the best of my memory this is exactly how it happened :)"],"Date of the Event":"05/13/2003 03:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/13/2003 03:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.226673,+-88.240664(18905)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18905) map </A>","Latitude":"35.226673"}
