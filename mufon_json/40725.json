It was going in a straight line from south to north. But what caught my attention was it started off about as bright as a satellite, but then started getting brighter. It become the brightest thing in the sky next to the moon. But then as quick as it got bright it started getting dim again. Then it just disappeared in front of me."],"Date of the Event":"07/08/2012 03:34 UTC","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-82.924091","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
