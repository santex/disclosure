It was moving at a slow speed ( about as fast as a slow airplane) over the City of Philadelphia art museum area. It was traveling from north to south directly overhead and had no sound. The lights were located on each end or to be more specific (in the middle of the circumference of the ends, underneath) they were not blinking and were as bright as the stars around them. The object blocked out the stars as it moved and you could see its gray silhouetted on the dark blue or black of the skies background. It was cigar shaped with a bulge in the middle on one side. The ends were rounded like a cylinder. It was moving sideways with the bulge leading, not long ways. There were no windows that I could see. At arms length it was the length of my thumb. The sky was clear, almost pristine except for the light pollution from the city. Just before I lost sight of the object I observed panels opening and closing on the ends, condensing vapor coming off of the objects surface like it was getting very cold. It then appeared to tilt up and quickly faded into the darkness of the sky in a kind of haze. In my opinion it was as large as a commercial air plane but It���s hard to be all conclusive about its size or its distance when there is no point of reference. But the details I saw make me feel that it wasn���t that far away. I'm still looking up at where it was, facing south when another light appeared from the north traveling as fast as a shooting star, made a long 90��� turn without slowing down and shot off to the east. How do I feel about this event, well it rocks my sense of reality."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 02:56 UTC","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Louvres, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.958035,+-75.160639(18061)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18061) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 02:56 UTC","Summary":"cigar shaped object with a bulge in the middle on one side","Log Number":"US-07132009-0026","Case Number":"18061","Country":"United States"}
