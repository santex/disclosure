I looked up and saw what appeared to be a moving star. It seemed as bright as a medium brigtness star, so I spotted it immediately. I continued to watch this object, looking for any sort of strobe to signinfy this was an aircraft (there was no strobe) for the appx 2-3 minutes it took to go from straight up to the northern horizon. It moved in a straight line. It was getting dimmer as it moved away from me as I expected, but appx 10 seconds before it completely faded from view, it got very bright (it was the brightest object in the sky) for appx 2-3 seconds. I was standing alone,but actually said out loud - wow that got brighter! Within 2 seconds, about 5 degrees to the west I saw (2) quick, bright flashes. I assumed this was an aircraft and I told myself \"that is what a strobe should look like\". I looked back at the object and watched it fade from view appx 5-10 seconds later. I then tried to locate the source of the flashes - there were no aircraft anywhere to be seen."],"trends":[],"Latitude":"31.973729","Case Number":"10600","Summary":"I observed an object travel from south to north, get brighter for appx 2sec, then fade from view.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-04292008-0006","Longitude":"-99.896613"}
