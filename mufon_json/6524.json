{"Summary":"Two Objects sighted in day light.","Date Submitted":"03/03/2007 12:35 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"6524","Log Number":"BR-03082007-0003","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Brasilia","There were no other sightings in Brasilia on or around March 3rd 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"divs":["sighting detailswe were 7 witnesses in guara 1 quarter in brasilia, in a house on an extension on the second floor, which is outdoor. we had clear sky with clouds passing over. then one of the witnesses (woman) noticed a punctual object moving high in sky to the south-west and disappearing. during the event the witness called the attention of the other 6 (six) gathered in the same place of the house and we all could see the object moving away. then right after that the same first witness noticed another object stationary high in sky, more than 1.000 meters above the passing clouds almost at zenith. the object remained stationery until a cloud passed over it. when the cloud was gone the object also was gone. the first object that moved in south-west direction had the speed evaluated to be at least 300 km\\h or higher when it disappeared. after the second object disappeared after the cloud passing, the second object returned in a slower speed and stopped high in sky at an altitude evaluated to be of more than 1000 meters to the south at an angle to be estimated, but i believe it to be around 70 degrees in ascension. the object remained stationery until another cloud passing over hid the object. after the cloud moved away the object was gone. 13 photos ware taken with an slrd camera, in 80mm and 300mm telephoto lenses, of the second object, the one that moved before and after. but as the camera is digital, aps sized ccd sensor, there are considerations to be taken for the true focal length, because the lenses were designed for a 35mm non-digital film. we thought the objects could be balloon probes from the brazilian air force at jk airport in brasilia. we had contacted them by telephone and e-mail and they said that at that given interval of time on saturday 03\\03\\2007 there were no meteorological balloons over brasilia. they launch balloons at 9 o'clock in the morning and at 21 o'clock in the evening. everyone was very excited about the sightings. also the meteorological service in brasilia (inmet) was contacted by telephone but they do not launch balloon probes. i also would like to mention a previous sightings about 20 days before this one, with no photographic evidence, of three objects, two moving in parallel trajectory and blinking, and one stationery in the sky while the other went past. this time the two objects were extremely rapid, ant the stationery one disappeared after the passage of the other two. thanks. pedro luz cunha (revista ufo consultant, cbpdv associate with a.j. gevaerd)."],"Latitude":"-14.235004","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Source":"MUFON","City":"Brasilia","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"Brazil","Longitude":"-51.92528","Region":"","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path then hovering,Other","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/03/2007 12:35 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-14.235004,+-51.92528(6524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6524) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6524.html"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Oval"}
