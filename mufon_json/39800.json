Because of the small size of my camera screen and for the darkness surrounding us during this event, I could not see the fine details of each photo until I had downloaded the photos onto my computer the next day. As you can see on the first photo (named for the time taken at 10:10PM and 46 seconds), there is something on the top tip of the lighten moon which is cylinder in shape and has a grey color. You can see this object also has a shadow on the far side in line with the shadow of the moon and is sharper in detail then the moon because the moon is slightly out of focus. The second photo was taken at 10:10 and 50 seconds and the object is less clear. Maybe the object is moving closer to the moon? The next two photos, (10:11:54 seconds and 10:12:24 seconds) I cannot see the object."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39800.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39800.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.433176,+-95.256384(39800)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39800) map </A>","Log Number":"US-06252012-0011","Case Number":"39800","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Houston MUFON Meetup - Moon Photos","Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 10:10 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
