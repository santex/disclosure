{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs soon as I looked up, I saw over ten orbs passing through a few kilometer break in the clouds. They were heading from NNW to SSE over Toronto, Ont. I ran into my work and grabbed the first person I could, and ran back out to see the last six disappear behind the clouds. My workmate saw the last two orbs. We stayed outside for about 5- 10 min and saw nothing else before heading in. I came out 5 min later to see another orb following the same path just coming into sight. I banged on the window of my work, and two workmates came out to observe the last orb. I stayed out for about 30 min after that, and saw nothing else. There were planes in the air, and were easily distinguishable from the orbs. The orbs were much higher, and faster. I have seen many satalights, meteors, comets, planes, helicopters, balloons, birds, space station, and even what I believe to have been a supernova, and this was unlike anything I have seen before. Both my workmates are as baffled as I, as to what we saw."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.838412","Summary":"over 12 orbs verry high, verry fast. colors changed rapidly from yellowy orang, read, and white.","Log Number":"CA-07172012-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.838412,+-79.086758(40874)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40874) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"40874","Date of the Event":"07/16/2012 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/17/2012 09:58 UTC","Country":"Canada","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40874.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40874.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Pickering","There were no other sightings in Pickering on or around July 16th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Ontario","Longitude":"-79.086758","City":"Pickering"}
