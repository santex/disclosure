I noticed it because it wasn't pulsating but coming closer. When I alerted the two other people with me, we all stood up and watched it move from a straight path to a zig zag pattern. It first came in straight from the north east and then moved to a south west pattern. While doing so, it made some zig zags while still moving. It's color was orange and solid. Nothing was pulsating like a plane."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/29/2013 10:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-06302013-0007","Region":"North Dakota","Case Number":"48516","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48516.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48516.html"]}
