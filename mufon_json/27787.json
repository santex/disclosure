I noticed the moon shining though the trees on the right side in front of me, and thought that was odd, I've seen the moon set earlier this night and I turned to look to the direction where the moon should be, there was nothing visible behind the trees so I turned back and the light behind the trees I just saw was also gone, that's strange I thought and kept walking, wondering what it could have been. About 50 meters further on the road I saw a bright green star, about the magnitude of Venus when it's at it's brightest but there are no green stars and I am quite interested in astronomy and sure that was no planet. I stopped and stared at the thing thinking what in the world is that, the color made me think of the northern lights. About 2-3 seconds it stood perfectly still in the sky, just like a star and then it shot away to the south west leaving nothing but a green line for a split second. I walked the rest of the way home looking at the sky trying to see something more, but that was all. I'll attach an illustration of approximately where in sky these objects were. The moon that appeared to the north-east was suppose to be setting in the north-west far below the treelike at this time, and the moon doesn't just disappear. There was no sounds or anything unusual other then the sighting. It was -12���c, clear and a light wind from the north"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Pietarsaari","Longitude":"22.703666","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pietarsaari","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27787.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27787_submitter_file1__Illustration.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27787.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=63.67455,+22.703666(27787)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27787) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Date of the Event":"02/12/2011 03:31 UTC","Region":"Ostrobothnia","Country":"Finland","Summary":"Bright moon-like light and a green star object shooting away.","Case Number":"27787"}
