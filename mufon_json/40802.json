I was in the same general slightly rural area, it was a little past 1pm approximately, and as I was leaving a store and heading to my car I looked up at the sky and I saw two silvery white, solid, perfectly crescent shaped craft heading from East to West, on the same exact flight path as I had seen them eventually take on my prior Sept 2011 sighting. They flew very close to each other in tight formation, one craft slightly behind the other craft and they did not waver from their flight path whatsoever. I watched them until they flew out of my visual range."],"Log Number":"US-07142012-0023","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40802.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40802.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
