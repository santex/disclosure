The original photos were taken because of the unusual cloud formations which came up very quickly over the lake. I did not see or hear anything in the sky while taking the original photos. While reviewing the photos recently, I noticed these small shapes. I did try to enhance and enlarge the shapes seen in the series (approximately 7) of photos on Photoshop (all of which had images of the small shapes). I am submitting several of the original photos plus some of the enhanced ones. I would like to see if I can find out what the images are. Thank you"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Cigar, Circle, Disc","Longitude":"-114.441097","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
