In my driveway working on my pickup truck, noticed object overhead because I routinely keep an eye on the sky due to the many sightings I have experienced. A light colored object with an irregular shape was floating in a straight line against the light breeze. It was moving slowly at low altitude, made some S-turns, then vanished. It did not travel off out of sight, did not descend or ascend, it just vanished. At first I thought it could be a balloon or piece of paper, but decided it wasn't due to it moving against the light breeze and it's straight flight path before making the S-turns. I wanted to run and get binoculars but decided to stay put, had kept my camera in the car but my wife had just left in the car. The sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds."]}
