It literally just appeared out of the darkness! It was a large orange sphere and changed in size, from large to small, as it flew across the sky. The light appeared to have a very fast pulse rate and was fuzzy around the outer edges when it was in an expanded state. The object appeared to be flying at a constant speed, heading in the direction of Dana Point. While observing the object, it disappeared for a few seconds, and then reappeared moments later; it continued flying in the direction of Dana Point. Just before it disappeared it became very large and then reduced in size, twice. It went from large, to medium, to small, in that sequence, and then it just disappeared. The whole event lasted about three minutes. I also observed that there were no flashing transponders on the object; as normally seen on aircraft."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"25572","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
