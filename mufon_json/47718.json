So I took several photos and to my surprise later on realized what was flying by the moon so I took some more shots hoping to catch what I was experiencing in some way. It has so far happened twice. Pretty cool when you see something of this magnitude with your own eyes and get to capture a glimpse of the true living breathing universe. Now it's not just stories I've heard it makes a difference on how you judge and determine others encounters. May truths be told and understood."],"Log Number":"US-05292013-0003","Date of the Event":"05/17/2013 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.668917,+-81.509194(47718)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47718) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"47718"}
