As I always do when im out late i look at the stars and all that stuff. I was about a 3rd of the way across when I noticed a small star like red object moving erraticly at 10:33pm. After a few seonds it dissapeared. At first I thought nothing of it, A few minutes later at 10:41pm I saw an intensly bright white light appear then dissapear. Then a few minutes after that at 10:53pm I saw what I believed to be a sattilite, But the odd thing about the sattilite type thing is that it soon became intensly bright just like the event before this then discharged a red object like the first event then dimmed out to much dimmer than it was origionally then dissapeared."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30436.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30436.html"],"Country":"Canada","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"CA-08082011-0037"}
