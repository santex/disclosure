I was on the highway driving home when I noticed a bright reddish-yellow sphere to the right of my car right above the treetops. The object was probably about a hundred feet away. When I first saw the object I thought that it was a light from a helicopter. I was led to this assumption because the light seemed to blink and pulsate. I continued to watch the light and while I was watching it it pulsated one more time and then disappeared. About 20 seconds after it disappeared a new one \"formed\". I then happened to look out of my window again and noticed a large triangle formed out of what looked like three small orbs. The three orbs seemed to be turning in sync which leads me to believe that they were all apart of one \"mother-ship\" I guess you could call it. This was the first time I have ever seen something like this."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39517.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39517.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Joppa","There was one other sighting in Joppa on or around June 19th 2012"],"Latitude":"39.417622","City":"Joppa","Source":"MUFON"}
