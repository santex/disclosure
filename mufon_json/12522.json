He noticed first \"Look, that must be some type of space thing, there is no blinking lights and it is going to fast and there is no noise for as low as it is, and is to low to be an airplane\". He left a minutes later, I stood outside and went to the roof, I saw the object come back in the opposite direction NORTH increase in a lot of altidude to a star like appearance still moving at an incedible speed then up and disappear. I was somewhat excited and in denial that it could be a UFO, but I could not find another explaination to what I saw.
