{"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in college and my friends and I were riding in a car up in the mountains near Greensburg, PA. There had been a sighting approximately 7 miles away and had been cordoned off. AS we were driving, I felt soothing strange. I was in the back seat and looked up through the back window when I saw an object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering above us and following us. The other 3 people saw the same object. We were afraid and the driver floored the car to return back to school. Shortly after that time, the object turned 180* and disappeared into the sky."],"Latitude":"40.310508","City":"Greensburg","Object Shape":"Disc","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30926.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30926.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-79.533479","Case Number":"30926","Date of the Event":"10/15/1965 02:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-08152011-0021","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Greensburg","There was one other sighting in Greensburg on or around October 15th 1965"],"Date Submitted":"08/15/2011 05:03 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.310508,+-79.533479(30926)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30926) map </A>","Summary":"Saw disc-like object in sky with lights flashing around base of object.
