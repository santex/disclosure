It was a clear night and the moon was not out yet, so many of the stars were alreaqdy eluminated. Immediately up in the southern night sky I observed a bright redish-orange circular type object traveling from the south-southwest towards the north-notheast, at what appeared to be a constant altitude. Although I felt excited and somewhat in disbelief at what I was witnessing, I tried to make sure I remained calm and not get too over excited as I watched the object flying across the sky. I wanted to go grab my binoculars that were in my car, which was at the front of the house, but at the rate of speed this object was flying I knew I would not be able to get back in time before it flew out of sight. We live less than 1 mile from our local airport and are 4 miles from Eglin AFB (\"as the crow flys\"). I am an aviation enthusiast, so I have a good idea what an airplane looks like and sounds like. There was no sound or any navigational lights on this object as it moved across the sky. Based on my observation angle of the object in relationship to the horizon, I estimate the altitude was between 5,000-10,000 feet. At those altitudes even small engine airplanes can be heard. But what struck me as odd, other than the fact there were no navigational lights, was the speed at which this object was traveling. I estimate the object was crusing at over 1,000 mph and although the trajectory was basically in a stright line, the object seemed to vary its speed (almost like short hesitations or jolts in speed). I watched the object travel to the north-northeast (towards the Vernon & Defuniak Springs, Florida area) for about 60 seconds and then out of sight. This object was too low to be considered a space satilite and had no elluminated vapor trail to be considered a meteor."],"Longitude":"-86.482172","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7142.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7142.html"]}
