At first I thought it was a fighter, but then I realized it didn't have the lights a normal plane had and it wasn't moving. It was very low in the sky, low enough to recognize the shape. I would've stopped, but being unfamiliar with the area, I wasn't sure if it was safe. I'm certain there are more witnesses to this event."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"01/12/2013 11:02 UTC","Longitude":"-83.213873","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Southfield","There were no other sightings in Southfield on or around January 12th 2013"],"Latitude":"42.478649","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01122013-0010"}
