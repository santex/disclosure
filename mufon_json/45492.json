(resembled the comet halebop with the tail) It moved from the west over the everglades to the east towards the beach. I was looking north towards Palm Beach County. It was a clear night and stars were visible. The object was moving at a steady speed and then the trail disappeared but object remained. Then the trail reapeared and then the entire object disapeared for a few seconds, reapeared to the east with the trail and then it just vanished. I live near the airport so I know what airplanes look like. All I do know is that this was no airplane, no FAA lights, no noise. My feeling is that I just saw something that I couldn't explain nor identify. I was excited so I went back in the house to write down and draw a pic of what I just witnessed."],"Date Submitted":"01/30/2013 11:10 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45492.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45492.html"],"Longitude":"-80.138479","City":"Fort Lauderdale","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"45492","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/30/2013 08:50 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
