I saw to the East of me an extremley large group of three inverted Y's or wishbone shaped objects. These objects were flying in a line formation. The two outter objects were all white in color and the center object of this formation was blinking red. Estimated size of this object from my perspective was as big as a football field. It seemed to hover without moving and was relativly low for an aircraft in this area. This object suddely disappeared."],"Longitude":"-85.414198","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Sturgis","Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Sturgis","There were no other sightings in Sturgis on or around August 15th 2008"]}
