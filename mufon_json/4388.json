We were actually discussing a U.F.O experience when I looked up and noticed a light hovering in the distance but not too far away. To answer all of the non-believers and liars: It was not an electomagnetic force from under us; it was not a plane or helicopter or Saturn or whatever else excuse you can make up this time. You should notice at this point that I am quite verbose or at least affluent in language and therefore thought and assumption or assertion of unusual occurrences. So the object hovered for a brief time, then moved left, then right, then up then down, then at an unusual speed progessed to the south faster than any human body could adjust to or handle. So: A copy of a crashed craft? There is more here than that because of the speed. That's all, Drew."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/10/1998 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Tampa","Date of the Event":"06/10/1998 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Longitude":"-82.454968","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"4388","Summary":"This object appeared to be a conventional light, no different than a plane or helicopter.
