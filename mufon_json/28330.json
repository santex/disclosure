My grandparents were also outside with me, playing with my daughter on her swing set. While aiming my shot of the moon I noticed what I thought was some debris on my lens, so I cleaned it and prepared to try the shot again. I observed at this point that I could make out the object only through the camera lens, and that it was not obvious to the naked eye. At that point I realized that I was not seeing a spec on my lens but rather something in the sky. I tried to use my auto focus to capture the object, but it kept focusing on the moon. I turned off the auto focus and manually targeted the object: this is the picture that is attached to this report. I don���t know if it is important, but my camera is a Canon Rebel T2i with a Sigma 18-250 mm lens; the photograph was taken zoomed all the way in. Once the image was captured, I reviewed it on my camera and called my grandparents over to see what I had photographed. None of us had ever seen an airplane like this before. My grandparents and I both looked up but none of us could see the object. I set my camera to ���live mode��� (allowing us to see the viewfinder���s image on the screen on the back of the camera), positioned it, and we all saw the object. I���m not sure if we couldn���t see the object with the naked eye because of its size in the sky or something else, but whatever the case we could only see it through the camera. While I never actually saw the object moving, it was in slightly different positions to the moon every time I looked at it. We talked about it for a couple of minutes and I tried to get another picture of the object (I couldn���t find it this time) and we decided to come upload the images to the computer to look at them a little closer."],"Summary":"Unknown craft observed while photographing the lunar perigee","City":"Pine Prairie","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/20/2011 03:51 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-92.425411","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"30.783807","Log Number":"US-03202011-0014","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28330.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28330_submitter_file1__Original.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28330_submitter_file2__Cropped.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28330_submitter_file3__Closeup.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28330.html"]}
