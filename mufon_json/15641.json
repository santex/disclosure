The hugh red fireball appeared to be much larger than our house and I thought that it was just barely over tree top level. It traveled very slow for a metorite (maybe the speed of a small plane flying over, or slower). The fireball was covered with and trailing red flames as it flew slowly by horizontal to the ground and not making a noise. Expecting a nearby crash from this giant ball of fire, I covered my head with my pillow awaiting the impact that never came. The next day I heard on the radio that a large metorite was seen falling in the area the night before and a search was underway to locate it. I never heard another word about it. Been watching the skies for many years now, and have never seen a anything flying across the sky this large, low, or slow covered with red flames of fire."],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"Dixon"}
