At approximately 9:47 pm I looked out my window (passenger) as we were coming up to a curve and noticed three extremely bright white pulsating orbs in a triangle formation, they looked like they were over a cornfield, but there is also a lake a very short distance behind that cornfield. I did not take my eyes off of the objects, they were probably less than half a mile away and the highest object was probably no more than 300-500 ft off the ground. As we came around the corner i was fidgeting in my seat to see where the objects had been, thinking it was such a short time and they would still probably be there but i looked into the open sky after the curve above the cornfield and lake but they had vanished. There were no other colored lights along with the orbs (green, red, etc.)So it was probably not planes. i could see the night sky between the objects so i don't know if it was one object or many. My boyfriend did not see the objects, he was talking and driving and i didn't want him to think i was crazy because this is the second one i have seen this year."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
