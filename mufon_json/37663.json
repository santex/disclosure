All of these possibilities were ruled out after some research, as an airplane doesn't hover or go backwards diagonal so quickly etc. The space station moves faster and usually in an east to west flight. This object flashes randomly and moves very randomly. It looks as if a flashing laser pointer is being pointed into the sky. Its movements are not graceful and very erratic. i watched it for almost 4hrs (not knowing how much time has passed) Had to get to bed but see it every night around 1am when the sky is clear. i plan to break out the telescope tonight to get a better look."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Marbury","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/22/2012 05:47 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"38.575397","Longitude":"-77.155534","Region":"Maryland","Case Number":"37663","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Marbury","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.575397,+-77.155534(37663)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37663) map </A>","Summary":"Has been seen every night (with no cloud cover) for a week now and starts around 1 am all through the night (until i pass out and stop watching it).
