{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was cooking out in my back yard last night and noticed a bright light moving towards my home moving very slowly. Its stopped above my yard and hovered their all night. From time to time it relocated its positon. It appeared to be right below the cloud level. It has been coming back every evening but in different parts of the sky. It can be seen from inside my house tonight through the skylight in ther living room. I lookin at the object with a neighbors telescope and it appears to look likr the moons surface with craters. Sometimes it blinks red and blue colors and changes to a trianle shape. I would really like to take a video of it if I can find one that will show objects that far away. When I first saw the object I thought it was a planet but realised it was too close to be a planet or a star.I watch it desend in the morning when I woke up and it went straight up way past the cloud level untill it was ony a tine spec straight up above me.I was am very excited to find out more of this object and it is visible right now!"],"Summary":"Bright White lite and others blinking red and blue speres","Longitude":"-96.654059","Log Number":"US-08202009-0003","Tags":"City","Case Number":"18768","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/17/2009 08:59 UTC","Sighting Duration":"12:00:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.184996,+-96.654059(18768)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18768) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/17/2009 08:59 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in McKinney","There were no other sightings in McKinney on or around August 17th 2009"],"Latitude":"33.184996","Region":"Texas","City":"McKinney","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18768.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18768.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Source":"MUFON"}
