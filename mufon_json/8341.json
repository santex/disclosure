Latitude- 40 degrees 48.95 North. Longitude- 81 degrees 56.27 West. Sitting on a wooden deck, looking up. straight up. My eyes adjusted somewhat after looking at sky for a few seconds. Noticed a long cigar shape, way up above atmosphere. If they were in orbit, how could I see that far?, then. But anyway, a craft was sitting in space above me, it must have been huge if I could see it. After seconds ticked off, I kept staring. Not long after, another craft, the same size, joined beside the first. The left craft (from my position, looking up)started to move West. And it continued West until it was out of sight. The first ship stayed in the same orbital position until I went in the house to get a drink. I was slightly shook. That's it. The sky was crystal clear."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/17/2003 10:14 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8341.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8341.html"],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Akron","There were no other sightings in Akron on or around July 17th 2003"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Summary":"cigar- very lengthy","Case Number":"8341","Log Number":"US-11132007-0005","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
