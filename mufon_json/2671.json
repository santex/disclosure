I passengerwas just looking around, and happened to look to the right. At the top of thehill parallel to us Bells Ferry Rd. and Earnest Barrett Pkwy, I noticed that alarge metallic object was hovering in the sky about 300 feet above the ground. Iasked my husband driver to look as well. We both saw this object and observedthat it was not moving at all. It did not look like a plane or a blimp or aballoon of any kind--we didnt know what to make of it. We were forced to proceedonto the highway and our view of the object became obstructed. We exited thehighway at Bells Ferry Rd. and turned right East to go back in the directionwhere we saw the object. When we arrived at the intersection of Bells Ferry Rd.and Earnest Barrett Pkwy, the object was no longer there or visible--whichever.We have no idea what it was The weather was calm, no wind.
