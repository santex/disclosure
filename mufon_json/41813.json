The same pulsating cloud just outside over my house. I woke up to let my dogs out and saw one entire cloud pulsing non stop. Last time I called the police to get a witness but they came when the sun came up and missed it. This time I called CNN but they did not seem to care. The cloud pulsated continuously until day break. I filmed it like last time but its hard to see the pulsating on video. The I zoomed in to see black spheres in the form of a traingle. Then they disintegrated. I can not imaging why a cloud would pulsate!"],"Longitude":"-118.452074","Log Number":"US-08172012-0011","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41813.html"],"trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around July 28th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.978777,+-118.452074(41813)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41813) map </A>","Summary":"One cloud outside my window was pulsing then I saw a triangle","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Los Angeles","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Region":"California"}
