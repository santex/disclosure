The sky was perfectly clear with no clouds, and the sun was beginning to set. I noticed an object in the sky that didnt look right. It appeared to be stationary and showed little movement for over 5 minutes. When I first saw it I assumed it was a rocket in the distance but as time lapsed and it didnt move I began to think it may be something other than military. My party continued to watch until after a short period the object began to rise in the sky slowly at first and then accelerate. We watched it until it disappeared."],"Date of the Event":"06/22/2012 07:45 UTC","Case Number":"39883","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39883.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39883.html"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/28/2012 09:01 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Las Vegas","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Nevada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.110185,+-115.172253(39883)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39883) map </A>","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around June 22nd 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"object hovered in sky for 5+ minutes then accelerated straight up"}
