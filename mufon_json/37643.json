At first they were close together but eventually branched out, but remained geared in the same direction. When one would get a certain height it would fade out, as did those after it. Not quite sure what to make of them honestly. Im used to seeing lights, but not in that direction. Normally they are towards the north by where Nellie AFB is, but we are all used to those here.
