At first he thought it might be an aircraft but then it hovered. He called his wife but she could not locate it. The object ascended at a 45 degree angle until the window frame blocked his view. He immediately got up and wnet into the adjacent kitchen, opened the door to get a better look but the object was gone. He described the object as looking like a \"pin ball\" from a pin ball machine. He had no unusual feelings or sensations at the time but he felt compelled to contact NH MUFON via Email. This was his third sighting in as many years but those were in a different location on the west side of Concord, NH."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"01/28/2007 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6380.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6380.html"],"Tags":"City"}
