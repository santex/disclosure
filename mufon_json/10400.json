We were on route 160 about 30 miles SW of Las Vegas on the way to Pahrump NV. We stopped about 20 miles from Pahrump on the side of the road. It was around 9 PM or so and we noticed a bright egg shape white moon colored object over the city of Pahrump....hovering around a mile up. We observed the object for about 20 mins and then resumed our rest. As we started to leave we noticed the object now was above our heads maybe 1000 feet and standing still. No noise, but seeing this object hovering above us scared us half to death and we imediately got into car and sped away."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Pahrump","There were no other sightings in Pahrump on or around June 24th 1968"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/24/1968 09:21 UTC","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/24/1968 09:21 UTC","Case Number":"10400","Latitude":"36.216764","Summary":"Lighted objected over city of Pahrump and then over our car","Region":"Nevada","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Egg","Log Number":"US-04182008-0010","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.216764,+-115.979915(10400)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10400) map </A>","City":"Pahrump","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
