It was V shaped. Then after that on the other side of the sky was a multicolored same shape Object (very large). I didn't get the chills looking at that one that I got with the first. It was amazing! My daughter saw it also. This is not the first time I have seen a UFO. I made it in the UFO magazine 16 years ago. It was about this time of year I saw it then. Same shape. Just a'lot bigger this time. My daughter said I should have taken a picture with my phone, but it just didn't enter my mind at the time I was seeing it. I have told no one about this, but I am positive other's would have had to have seen it also, it was very large in size."],"Date Submitted":"01/15/2010 04:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21507.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21507.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.472357","Country":"United States","Case Number":"21507","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/14/2010 12:00 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Gold Triangular Object (Large)","Latitude":"39.187276","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.187276,+-83.472357(21507)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21507) map </A>","City":"Rocky Fork lake (Rainsbor","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01152010-0011","Source":"MUFON"}
