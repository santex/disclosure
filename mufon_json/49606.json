I knew that it was not a star it was just too big. When I pulled over to take photos with my IPhone I noticed the three lights disappearing in what seemed to be a fog or clou, however there were no clouds in the sky. The larger bright glowing object was still there. Also there was a wavey vapor trail that was below the object but not close to the object, however you could tell that the contrail was from the object. It looked like it has coming from the ground up. This sighting went on for 10 minutes and I still took photos from my phone at my home. It then faded out and it was gone. What was left seemed to be a very bright whispy cloud almost like the moon was behind giving off a bright look to it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49606.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49606.html"],"Log Number":"US-08082013-0013"}
