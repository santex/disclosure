We looked up to see a bright silver object that at first looked like piece of cellophane, but realized it was a craft of some sort and egg shaped. It was wobbling erratically as if hit by something. It descended rapidly behind the tree line to the north of where we were standing and disappeared. We ran to our truck and drove toward where we thought it may have went, but the area was inaccessible."],"Summary":"Egg shaped craft, silver in color. Looks like it hit something in the sky then fell.","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Augusta","There were no other sightings in Augusta on or around June 27th 2011"],"Longitude":"-69.76982","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29779.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29779.html"],"Log Number":"US-06292011-0007","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Augusta","Latitude":"44.312164","Date of the Event":"06/27/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Maine","Case Number":"29779"}
