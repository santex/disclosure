{"divs":["sighting detailsi saw this ufo near the place i live(not to far from bod���, northern norway), i had a real good look at it through binoculars, but i saw only the lights, i was not able to make out the shape or construction, other than the lights in a triangular configuration, the middle light was almost as bright as the other, it stood still in the air, i recon the altitude was around 900 meters, it shed a light on the ground. the light was not intense, but more orange in color, like that of a candle or fireplace, but it lit up the ground in a circle of more than 500 meters, the light was not steady, it flickered a bit, but i was able to see trees and terrain details in the light. at some point it disappears, so fast that it seemed like the lights just went out. it made no sound that i could hear, but i was at some distance. it looked very much like the ufo in this clip: http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=6o2idp0x2zi i`m skeptical person, but i really don`t know what i saw, i`ve been interested in military and civilan aircrafts all my life, but i can`t say i recognise this one."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"67.280356","City":"Bodo","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15447.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15447.html"],"Country":"Norway","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/10/2000 12:00 UTC","Region":"Nordland","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"14.404916","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bodo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/10/2000 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"NO-02122009-0004","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15447","Summary":"Sighting of triangular shaped UFO.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=67.280356,+14.404916(15447)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15447) map </A>"}
