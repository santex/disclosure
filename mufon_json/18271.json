{"divs":["sighting detailsi am spending the summer in rural south western oregon. i spend most evening outdoors, and every night i see multiple bright lights that move in slowly from different directions. from a distance they appear to be aeroplane head lights, but as they come closer it becomes evident that they are not. they are silent, with no flashing lights, and they dissapear completely just when they begin to get close enough to us that we notice thewy aren't planes. come to think of it, i rarely see planes fly over at all, and i'm outside all day. sometimes it will at first seem to be a satelite, moving slowly in orbit around the earth, and suddenly -within seconds- it will gain light intensity until it is 3x brighter\\larger than the brightest object in the night sky (with the exception of the moon). they stay bright for varrying amounts of time, and i have seen them fade in a matter of seconds, far off in the distance as well as directly above our location. they normally appear alone, but there will usually be three or four flyovers in an evening, from multiple directions. others here have seen them as well, and several of them have witnessed the objects while hanging out on the lawn in the evening."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.813823,+-120.545201(18271)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18271) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Nightly in Wolf Creek: Brilliant slow moving lights that fade in and out of sight","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18271.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18271.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Oregon","Longitude":"-120.545201","Date Submitted":"07/18/2009 12:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/18/2009 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"43.813823","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"18271","Log Number":"US-07242009-0005","trends":[]}
