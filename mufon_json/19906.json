{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"10/10/2009 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsLet me describe my rather short encounter with something I couldn't explain. I work 3rd shift doing security at an apartment complex in downtown Providence. It was 5am, at which time I leave the office to check all the parking lots and unlock the lobby doors. I was walking from one building to the next when I noticed a light moving quite slow in the sky. I thought it was moving much to slow to be an airplane, also it was completely silent. It was similar to the way a hot air balloon would glow at night, but I do not believe this was a balloon. I took out my cell phone, as quick as I could, and took a couple pictures of this phenomena. It was moving from the north to the south in a straight line. It was completely overcast and it seemed as if the light was inside the cloud cover, as I could see no structure, just an orb of light. From the first picture to the last is a time span of about 1 minute."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19906.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19906_submitter_file1__Image030.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19906_submitter_file2__Image031.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19906_submitter_file3__Image032.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19906.html"],"Region":"Rhode Island","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Yellowish-gold glowing orb over downtown Prividence","Case Number":"19906","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Providence","Date Submitted":"10/12/2009 01:21 UTC","Log Number":"US-10122009-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"41.828339","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Providence","There were no other sightings in Providence on or around October 10th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.828339,+-71.406404(19906)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19906) map </A>","Longitude":"-71.406404","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO"}
