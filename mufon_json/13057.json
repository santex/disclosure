The object was described as being the same green color as a common glow stick or Cyalume light stick. The 20 other people were part of a marching band practice in an open football field. Conditions were partly cloudy and moonlit dark, with stadium lighting. The students were facing west. The object flew high overhead from east to west and caught their attention as it flew into view from over their shoulders. The object continued at the same elevation and then took a button hook turn to the right and upward, out of sight, in a northerly direction. There were no photos or video taping of the object that we know of at this point."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
