The only problem is that there were no red running lights and no flashing wing lights. After observing its flight path for a couple of minutes, it just disappeared. There was absolutely no sound at all. It was like whatever it was had turned off its lights. A short while later, a small plane was flying in the opposite direction, with red running lights and flashing wing lights. This is not the first time that my partner and i have seen this weird sight. According to my partner, he had seen another one a few minutes before i went outside tonight and we have also seen the same thing but on another night. Can anyone please explain to me what we saw?? The only explanation that i can come up with is that the RAAF are doing night flights with some sort of plane or drone - but it seemed similer in size to a large plane with its lights on but with no noise or flashing lights as would normally be the case."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Lithgow","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Australia","Tags":"City","Case Number":"47283","Latitude":"-33.472794","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Lithgow","There was one other sighting in Lithgow on or around May 9th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
