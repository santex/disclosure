It was brighter than any other star in the sky. I wanted a picture, so I took my items inside and grabbed a cell phone camera, and returned outside. At first I did not think it real, but then I wanted to show someone else what I had seen. The object had moved over top of a neighbors house about 150 yards away to the west. I placed the camera on the truck's roof to stabilize the shot. All of a sudden the object made a visible looping trail and I snapped the shot. the reddish glow at the bottom of the picture is the front porch light of the neighbors house. The object then sped away to the north-west and faded away to nothing."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Disposition":"Hoax","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like"}
