These crafts go back and forth or just appear moving before they turn really bright then dimming out. ON the 30th of July a craft appeared dimly and as I was talking on the cellphone with someone it made a LOUD SHRIEK of a noise I had never heard before. This sound was loud yet had had some static-y behind it. It WAS NOT like a walkie talkie or anything I had heard before in my life. I feel it was communicating with me. These craft I have observed in the past year since June 27th of 2010 have given me the realization that ARE in communication with me but that sound really hit home. These sightings begin in the northwest and northeast sky moving very deliberately and under control doing things I have not observed before, especially the flying back and forth across the sky. Very interesting to me. It has been almost every night since the beginning of July and my observations continue nightly. These sightings occur usually around 10pm every night; some much later and others a little earlier. I also observed a black almost opaque smaller object that left me feeling queasy and flew by me almost undetectable. This I only saw once July 28th. I cannot report each one every night as it would be tedious to do so. I am seeing this EVERY NIGHT."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30565.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30565.html"],"Region":"California","Latitude":"40.58952","Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Redding","There were no other sightings in Redding on or around July 30th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.58952,+-122.388335(30565)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30565) map </A>","Summary":"Two weeks of Star like craft appearing and moving across the night sky.","Log Number":"US-08092011-0107","Longitude":"-122.388335","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
