At address 2036 W 160th St Gardena Ca. I was looking at the location and in the sky is a unknown object. It is not the sun because it is on the other side. I don't think it's a street light because it's too far away from a pole. Anyone with google maps can go to this address and look for themselves and come to their own conclusions."],"City":"Gardena","Tags":"City","Summary":"Google Maps","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.897409,+-118.303062(22406)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22406) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"22406","Log Number":"US-03202010-0013","Longitude":"-118.303062","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
