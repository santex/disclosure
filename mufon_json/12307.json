{"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Chelsea","There was one other sighting in Chelsea on or around August 31st 2008"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw the sighting again but it did not come down it stayed up high. I used my field glasses to watch it. It was a bright white light till I put my field glass on then it was a multicolored light. It was ruoghly 2 degrees father east that the previous night. while I watched it in my glasses. I saw flashes of light like lightning. At 2am I went in the house because it was boring. The next night it was 1 to 2 degree farther east it was 12:15 Monday morning when I saw it again another 1 degree I let my dogs out about 1am. I saw another object different from the first not quite due east from the horizon. It was doing the same thing as the one as I was watching, flying crazy in the sky. also was multicolored. the first object flew off around 2am the other object was still there when I came in at 3:30 these were 2 support crafts. they were high in the sky. I would guess they were over Canada. They were not swap gas, they were not stars they were not airplanes they were not satellites, they weren't weather balloons. I have no idea of what they are. The light that I saw was like a camera flash."],"Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12307.html"],"Latitude":"42.323342","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Date Submitted":"08/31/2008 12:15 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-84.016993","City":"Chelsea","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/31/2008 12:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09012008-0011","Case Number":"12307","Summary":"UFO SIGTING","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.323342,+-84.016993(12307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12307) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
