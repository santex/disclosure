{"Region":"New Jersey","Summary":"2 Black Triangles Hovering Over Toms River","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Star-like, Triangle","Longitude":"-74.257985","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","divs":["Sighting DetailsMyself and my cousin were driving back home from Taco Bell on Route 37 when we saw two unidentified flying objects in the the sky. They looked like two huge black triangles with lights around the perimeter. At first from a distance we thought they were helicopters because they were just hovering in place without moving but as we got closer we noticed that there was no sound. They were situated off of Lakehurst Road over the neighborhood across the street from the Miracle Bar. There was no forward or backward movement and they seemed to be motionless hovering in the air. We continued down Lakehurst Road and lost sight of them once we turned down the road I live on. Both of us were completely sober at the time and had always remained skeptical of UFOs until tonight. Did anyone else see what we saw? If so please post about it so we know we are not insane."],"Date of the Event":"08/26/2013 10:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Wings","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"39.98486","Log Number":"US-08272013-0001","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.98486,+-74.257985(50206)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50206) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Toms River","There were no other sightings in Toms River on or around August 26th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50206.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50206.html"],"City":"Toms River","Case Number":"50206","Date Submitted":"08/27/2013 01:03 UTC","Tags":"City"}
