{"City":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailssighting report: on the morning of april 7th, 2005 i was camping with my wife at the carrizo plains national mounument. twenty minutes before sunrise we were in our sleeping bags watching the sunrise. i noticed right above me a very bright star. i know the heavens well enough to know this was not a planet, but brighter than jupiter which was setting to the west. it was also not on the zenith, but directly above us. i looked at it with my binoculars and saw a faint zigzag line starting at the middle of the right hand side and droping down to the left. while alternating watching the sunrise and star\\planet like object we noticed a faint star moving next to it. that star moved erractedly from the north to the northwest in comparison to the object. we became very excited, because this was not a shooting star or satalite. we kept looking at it and after about 10 minutes it was clear this object was moving very slowly to the northeast. we kept alternating watching the sunrise and the object and the object did not lesson in it s appearance even though the day was quite brightout by now. my last look at the object was now 10-12 minutes after first noticing it. after looking at the sunrise i looked up and it was not there! i then looked for it with my binoculars and saw a faint circular grey spot where it was last seen and three sparkculing objects moving southeast away from the grey spot. there was no tracing marks or sound, but the three objects faded after one minute. i have seen satalites come into our atmosphere here in washington and this was not like that at all. it was circular like a planet size object in the sky. what did i see?"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Not Provided","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/23/2005 10:43 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"","Country":"United States","Case Number":"3486","Date Submitted":"04/23/2005 10:43 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Longitude":"-119.415632","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.780651,+-119.415632(3486)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3486) map </A>","trends":[],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.780651","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3486.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3486.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Region":"California"}
