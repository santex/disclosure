{"Date of the Event":"04/06/2012 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile taking my evening walk, I first noticed what appeared to be a sommercial airliner traveling due West, normal flight path and leaving a contrail. Then, a very small, but extremey bright object catch my attention in the same sector of sky. But, it appeared to be much, much higher in altitude that the airplane. Most commerical flights are at 25,000 to 30,000 feet, but this object appeared to be atleast two or three times more distant and left no contrail and there was not noise. It was travel just about 090 or due East. I observed it for almost a minute and it just disappeared. If it was an air craft, it had to be at 60,000 to 70,000 feet. Its extreme brightness and extreme altitude were the main factors catching my attention. I looked repeatedly back to the sky, but what ever it was, it just disappeared from sight."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"exremely bright, star-like, shining as brightly as a small sun","Region":"West Virginia","Date Submitted":"04/06/2012 07:09 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in New Martinsville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.637295,+-80.861294(37159)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37159) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"New Martinsville","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"39.637295","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-80.861294","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37159.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37159.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04062012-0008","Case Number":"37159"}
