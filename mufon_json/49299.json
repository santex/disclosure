A yellow-orange glow with a same-colored, much more brighter object in the center of the glow passed, in a straight path, from West, above us, made a semicircle and went back the way it came from, but, not completely. On the straight way back it suddenly made a right turn upwards and disappeared. It was moving quite fast. My friend was rapturous and couldn't believe his eyes. I didn't share he's excitement because this is not the first time i saw the UFO. And believe me I don't even care if someone after reading this will think that what i saw maybe wasn't a spaceship. I know what I saw, and i want to know more."],"Longitude":"14.691505","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Was lying down looking at the sky and then it passed above me, made a semicircle move and went back to the direction it came from","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Oval","Object Flight Path":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.173583,+14.691505(49299)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49299) map </A>","Country":"Croatia"}
