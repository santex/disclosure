At first I thought it was a jet, but it was flying much faster than I had seen jets fly. I stopped at a traffic light at Edge Hill Rd, and watched the object continue west. I then saw the object brighten, fade, brighten again, fade again, then disappear. There were no clouds nearby for it to fly into, the sky was clear and almost cloud free, as it was the morning after a storm. The brightening and fading were what I would expect to see as an object turned or rotated, reflecting the sun. My reaction could best be described as intrigued, in a \"Huh. Look at that.\" sort of way."],"Case Number":"7328","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7328.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7328.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/24/2007 01:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Abington","There were no other sightings in Abington on or around June 24th 2007"],"City":"Abington","Longitude":"-75.125349","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.119833,+-75.125349(7328)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7328) map </A>","Latitude":"40.119833"}
