I was over to my mother's house next door with my sister and kids and we were looking out at the stars. All of a sudden from no where a very large bright white starlike object started moving in the sky traveling southeast in a slowlike motion with no sound. It was at a lower altitude than the other stars and seemed like it was landing. We got in our vehicle to see if we could still spot it..it had disappeared."],"Summary":"HUGE STAR LIKE OBJECT TRAVELING SOUTHEAST"}
