My Fiancee and I were watching Fox News Network Live from Baghdad war coverage. During the Night Vision scenes of the city during the first blackout, you could see the unidentified objects spiraling very rapidly through the sky in front of the camera. We had watched a show about the Unknown and how these images are being captured on still camera and video, but yet do not appear to the naked eye on either Discovery or TLC - these objects we viewed were identical to the footage the Unknown show had shown during their description of these objects. They thought perhaps it was an unknown insect species or alien species of some sort. But in trying to look for more information on these objects, we ran into no further information available to our findings."],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Country":"United States","Region":"Alabama","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Baghdad","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"32.323491","Object Features":"Louvres","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"2210","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/03/2003 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Several Pencil-shaped objects spotted on Fox News"}
