I went outside and saw a disk shapped object hovering above the chicken coop in my back lot. It was there for the better part of an hour. It was seen by all my neighbores. This happened a very long time ago and I wonder if anyone else would have seen it. I know that others in my area saw it because it was all over the CB Radio back then people say they saw a glowing disk over my house. It was even with my son upstairs window. He was little at the time but said he remebered seeing the light and wondering what it was. It was so bright that it woke him up. He never got out of bed to look at it. It made a humming sound as it rose up in the air. I think it was attracked to the green glowing light coming from the Chicken House. I am an old woman now and I thought I would tell someone about it before I died."],"Summary":"Disk Shaped Object over my Chicken Coop","Case Number":"15157","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Disc","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/20/1973 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Muncie","There were no other sightings in Muncie on or around June 20th 1973"]}
