{"Log Number":"CA-06122012-0020","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was laying on my patio looking at the stars when a triangular formation of 7 lights sped overhead at high speed from north to south, the time it took these objects to transverse the entire sky was 2-3 seconds. I went inside to tell someone and then went back outside, and again these objects passed by again however this time the object on the left side flew off and did a manuver and returned into the formation again it only took them 2-3 seconds to travel across the entire sky, i heard that when a pilot crashes the airforce will do a flyby and one plane will fly off and return to formation these did the same thing however the speed is not a plane or satalite for these take a very long time to travel across the sky considering the simalrity to usa air force leads me to believe that these object are a black ops craft like an unmaned stealth craft like in the movie stealth but i have never seen a human craft travel so fast even our space ships going 40,000mph take a few minutes to travel across the entire sky"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.254959,+-124.805615(39310)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39310) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Port Alberni","Region":"British Columbia","Summary":"7 lights in formation traveling at high speed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39310.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39310.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"39310","Date of the Event":"08/15/2009 12:00 UTC","Country":"Canada","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"49.254959","Longitude":"-124.805615","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Port Alberni","There were 2 other sightings in Port Alberni on or around August 15th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"06/12/2012 11:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON"}
