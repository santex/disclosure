{"Case Number":"41264","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my yard talking to my step mom and looked up in the sky and saw 2 cigar shaped crafts,no wings at all,no sound ,I would say they were flying in a straight line about 800 to 1000 feet high headed in a south southwestern direction. I told my step mom what I was looking at,within 2-3 minutes later another one flying in the same direction but it was farther from me than the first 2 were. and a plane was also flying in the same direction came over about the time the last one flew over,I could see the wings on the plane and I could hear it. There was no sound from any of the three cigar shaped objects. I was sitting facing the south the time was about 7:12-7:15 pm. I looked on my phone when I started talking to my step mom and it was 7:09,we talked for 12 minutes and 30 seconds. As low as they were flying the sound of aircraft engines would have been very loud. I have no doubt they were ufo's as i watch them every night but I cannot get anyone to come out and let me show them what I see. Every time I talk to someone from MUFON they don't have time to come out or some other excuse. If I had thought I would have told my step mom to let me call her back and used my cell phone video to record them but I didn't think about it till after I finished talking to her."],"Longitude":"-95.866542","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder","Date of the Event":"07/29/2012 07:10 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.031281,+-95.866542(41264)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41264) map </A>","Region":"Oklahoma","Latitude":"34.031281","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41264.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41264.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Boswell","There were no other sightings in Boswell on or around July 29th 2012"],"City":"Boswell","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-07302012-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Summary":"first 2 cigar shaped and in 2-3 minutes another one total of 3","Date Submitted":"07/30/2012 12:08 UTC"}
