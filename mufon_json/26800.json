We live in King and Queen county. Drove across the newly constructed bridge in between King William And New Kent Co. And thats when we saw a total of 24 vertical jet vapor trails. These appeared all around in 360 degrees. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it looked like missles being launched! That in itself was strange,but as we turned down the next road I saw a detailed dark object against the blue evening sky. It was nowhere near the previous things I described by the way. The object then pulsed an orange light,then moved slowly in an eliptical fashion then sped off. The previous objects I described continued until dark and at no time did I observe ANY lights at all as per faa regulation. This is the most interesting thing I have EVER observed in the sky. I cant belive I saw A ufo! If anyone else saw this please report!"],"Date Submitted":"11/30/2010 08:58 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26800.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26800.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"West Point","Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"metallic orblike eliptical movement pulsed orange light dashed off!","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
