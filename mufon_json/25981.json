The first thing I noticed was how huge the object was. The span of the triangle was incredible -- it was much bigger than any airplane. It moved very slowly across the sky. It moved too slowly to have been a plane or jet. The object made no noise and after about 3 minutes, it disappeared from the sky. I knew it was a UFO as soon as I saw it. One of my friends thought it was jet burners, but there is no way a jet could move that slowly. All my other friends watched with awe and said they had never seen anything like it before. I caught it on video with my cellphone and will upload it with this story."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.161748","Case Number":"25981","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Tennessee","Log Number":"US-10192010-0012","Tags":"City"}
