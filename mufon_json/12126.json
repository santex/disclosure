The sun was beginning to set to the West when I noticed a star-like object in the sky to the West. My first thought was that it might be Venus. My husband thought that it was strange to see a star in the direction of the setting sun, we normally see the first stars of the evening in the eastern sky. I looked at it through a pair of binoculars and noticed red and white lights that seemed to be flashing (rotating?). The object moved toward the east and that's when I realized it could not be Venus. We watched the object for approximately 20-30 minutes until it seemed to change direction and move away from us (North). We debated about what type of object it could have been. Satellites do not change direction, planets and stars do not move that fast. It was too high to be a plane. We are at a loss to explain this sighting."],"Date Submitted":"08/18/2008 06:30 UTC","Longitude":"-79.991636"}
