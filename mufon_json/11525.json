Early in the show, about 35 minutes into the show, I was observing a bi-plane doing his maneuvers with much smoke. Suddenly, I noticed this circular object and initially thought it was a smoke ring. The smoke from the biplane dissipated and the object remained the same size and shape moving slowly in an easterly direction. In the photos it appears to be on a slant. The last image I saw of it leveled off. It disappeared behind cloud cover. I showed my photo to several people and they claim to have seen it as well. I am a former crew cheif , aircraft mechanic, on F-4's and I know what aircraft look like. This was something I have never seen before. What you see in the photo is what I saw with the naked eye. I took the photo because thats what I saw with the naked eye."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Gulf Breeze","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07122008-0004","Source":"MUFON"}
