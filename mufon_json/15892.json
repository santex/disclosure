typically called a bolide. bolides occur anytime a large meteor hits earth���s atmosphere. ���most bolides last only a few seconds��� he said. ���some do last for up to five or six minutes, but 10 minutes is very rare.������ he also said ���it was exciting you were able to see this. it is even more exciting that you were able to capture it with a camera.��� ���the bolide sighting was not the first in the aiken area. {the astronomer} ���said that about 2 or 3 years ago, almost to the day, there was a sighting.��� ���i remember it because it was a few days before a meteor shower���, referring to the annual leonid meteor shower of mid-november. the astronomer said meteor showers generally are due to very fine-sized comet dust, and usually don���t produce the brightest bolides. he speculated that a few large comet fragments may be in the orbit of comet tempel-tuttle. end of article. the photo is somewhat similar to 2 photos submitted to mufon about a week ago from great britain. it was case #15454. those photos were labelled by the submitter ���points of light��� and ���bolides���. personally, for this object, or objects, to be as large as they obviously were, and remain airborne for 10 minutes, does not indicate space rocks. if they were part of a meteor, they would have to have hit the atmosphere at exactly the correct angle to 1) partially burn in the atmosphere, as it or they were clearly luminous, and 2) not fall to the surface within a 10 minute time span. i don���t know what it or they were, but i doubt they were space rocks. you can see the entire article and full-sized photo plus additional reports at http:\\\\alienvisitorevidence.blogspot.com"],"Log Number":"US-03072009-0007","Date of the Event":"11/15/2008 05:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Aiken","There were no other sightings in Aiken on or around November 15th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Aiken","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Case Number":"15892","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15892.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15892.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/15/2008 05:45 UTC","Longitude":"-81.717903","Region":"South Carolina","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
