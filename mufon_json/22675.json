My neighbors also saw the same objects. It was aprox 8:30 PM. This is the 2nd time we watched these objects, the 1st time was December 21st at 6:15-6:30P.M. We were standing in our back yard and these reddish glowing objects moved from the North to the South a couple of minutes a part. Our other neighbor saw it go over our house. Each time there was no noise, they were quiet, if we had not been looking up we wouldn't have noticed them. They don't fly fast just steady. The first time in Dec when they flew over the house, it was over cast but I could see like a metallic underside with what I thought at first was the fire from a hot air balloon but when we got our binoculars out we saw it wasn't a hot air balloon. We just watched as they disappeared in the distance. Not sure what it was."],"Case Number":"22675","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.0635","City":"Delray Beach","Latitude":"26.466352","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Sphere","Date of the Event":"04/01/2010 08:30 UTC","Object Features":"None, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22675.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22675.html"]}
