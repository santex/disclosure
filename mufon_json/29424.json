At first I thought it was a satielite but then once I figured out the direction it was moving I realized I never seen one move from east to west, there was also upper level clouds out that night and the light was below the cloud level. I would guess speed around 500 to 600 mph. There was no sound coming from the light at all. The last I seen the object was still traveing west before I lost sight over it over my house."],"City":"Lincoln","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.813122,+-96.678969(29424)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29424) map </A>","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Lincoln","There were no other sightings in Lincoln on or around June 4th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"29424","Region":"Nebraska","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45"}
