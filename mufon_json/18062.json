{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy daughter was riding her bike in Arlington , Texas. She was facing west and noticed the object high in the southern part of the western sky. It was black and the size of a pencil point. It was falling and then it became orange and began falling faster. It became orange with an orange tail and began falling very fast. It then became yellow and started flashing white at the nose. It was falling in front of the sunset and then turned black. It then fell below the tree line. She thinks it was at least as far away as Fort Worth (20 miles) or further. She thought it was a plane falling, but a plane crossed that area and it was bigger than a plane. Then she thought it was a meteor. She called me on her cell phone and told me about it. She was very excited. I have not seen anything about it on the news , maybe it will be on later."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"07/13/2009 08:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18062.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18062.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Latitude":"32.742347","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Fireball","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around July 13th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"07/13/2009 08:00 UTC","Summary":"It looked like an orange,falling meteor with a long, orange tail.","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"18062","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.742347,+-97.106876(18062)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18062) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07132009-0027","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Arlington","Longitude":"-97.106876"}
