{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw what looked like a star had very busy light blinking. It had all the motion of any star. It seemed to be in the same place the next night, third night it was gone. To be careful, I monitored the time, and the big dipper as constant reference points to coincide with the two trees. I used two trees as reference points, for the star's location. The skies have been clear all week, including the three nights in question. The object caught my attention when I was star watching on my back porch. I called MUFON last night, asking if I was seeing something other than a star. I did add that it acted like a star, by having a consistent location. I did see the international space station go over head tonight."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around August 7th 2012"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41603.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41603.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Summary":"Looked like a star with a lot of really fast light flashing airplane on steroids","Longitude":"-122.116822","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Date Submitted":"08/10/2012 03:07 UTC","Log Number":"US-08102012-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.202262,+-122.116822(41603)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41603) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","City":"Arlington","Case Number":"41603","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Washington","Date of the Event":"08/07/2012 11:06 UTC","Latitude":"48.202262","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
