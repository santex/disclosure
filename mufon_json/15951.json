{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my husband were sitting outside our home having a BBQ around 10:30 am. My husband and son were playing washers while I was sitting watching them. Our son just got him a new digital camera for Christmas and I noticed on me and my husband's Colorado trip, it took such great pictures compared to ours. I was taking random pictures of the sky. I never once noticed anything in the sky that day but clouds. Our son had seen a dot on the picture when he was going through them and then came to me and asked me what this was. I downloaded the pictures and this is what I found. There are three, one is the orginal, one with writing on it, and one up-close. To be honest, I don't know what it is. Me and my husband both are true believers due to past and present experiences, including our trips through New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Texas."],"Log Number":"US-03102009-0012","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Louisiana","City":"Lake Charles","Longitude":"-93.215456","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.232315,+-93.215456(15951)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15951) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"15951","Summary":"Circle/sphere like object.","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Lake Charles","There were no other sightings in Lake Charles on or around February 24th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Date Submitted":"02/24/2009 10:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/24/2009 10:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"30.232315","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15951_submitter_file1__DSCI0690.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15951_submitter_file2__DSCI0690(2).jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15951.html"]}
