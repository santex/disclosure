This sphere was much brighter than the others. I studied this object realizing it wasn't stationary like the stars around it appeared. After watching the strange object for many minutes, I grabbed a pair of binoculars and began to study it the best I could. I saw what appeared to be multiple white lights clustered with a red orb to the top right (it appeared as if the object was tilted). The object grew very bright then dim, it appeared to hover closer (yet this was just above the horizon and was still quite far away from me). It also began slowly moving to the south until I lost it in my line of sight due to close trees."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"White Pulsating Orb With Orange Fireball Atop","Log Number":"US-09162012-0005","Region":"Indiana","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
