At approx. 21:20 I noticed a \"star\" moving across the the sky heading north-west and immediately knew it was not an airplane (live near Philly international), due to its very high altitude and singular light and the fact that it was slightly blinking (atmospheric interference perhaps?) Tracked it for about 2 minutes and then noticed it came to a complete stop. At this point, having witnessed a similar event 3 years ago, I just got too spooked and went inside."],"Case Number":"12174","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.960735,+-75.155279(12174)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12174) map </A>","Summary":"Star size dot moving north west stops in mid air","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Philadelphia","Date of the Event":"08/22/2008 09:20 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/22/2008 09:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-08222008-0009","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-75.155279","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There was one other sighting in Philadelphia on or around August 22nd 2008"]}
