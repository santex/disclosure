At first glance I thought it may be an airplane,although I watched it for over an hour while it stayed hovering, never moving,and also right away I realized airplanes dont exhibit such an unusual spectrumof flashing colors. I decided to go in and get my friends and family, they allwitnessed this strange light that hadnt been there before. We all counted manydifferent colored lights, even more clearly through binoculars. Everyone wasstunned, never having seen such a thing before. Nobody could identify theobject. It is still there hovering in the same location. 1000pm"],"Latitude":"44.393457","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"01:59:00","Region":"Oregon","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
