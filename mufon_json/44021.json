At first I thought it was a helicopter or aeroplane, but I noticed something peculiar. It \"split\" into two lights in the sky and hovered next to each other momentarily. Then one starts going off to the left, then fades into the sky and the other object completely vanishes."],"Region":"","Log Number":"GB-11192012-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.770496,+-1.886049(44021)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44021) map </A>","Case Number":"44021","Country":"United Kingdom","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Bournemouth","There were no other sightings in Bournemouth on or around October 28th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"One light ascended, split into two lights, then both went into different directions and faded away.","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"50.770496","Longitude":"-1.886049","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44021.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44021.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","City":"Bournemouth","Date Submitted":"11/19/2012 04:11 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval"}
