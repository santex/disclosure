(this may have been due to some small clouds moving in, but hard to tell in the faint dusk light.) total time of observation was around 10-15 minutes. i am an engineer and have a good understanding of physics, avionics, etc. i cannot come up with any rational explanation of what i saw. it must have been swamp gas :-) i've checked the skies every night since then but have not seen a repeat performance."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/25/2012 11:47 UTC","City":"Boise","Case Number":"39815"}
