Not really sure what it was. Although it was much brighter than anything else in the sky, I guess it could have been that recently launched space-plane. Anyway, I was night fishing on Truman Lake when I saw it. Approximately 9:30pm. I didn't think too much of it, except that it was very bright. Looking to the north at about 60degrees from horizontal, and several miles away. Yes, it was very humid that night. In fact, my boat and everything it was soaking with dew. It was very bright for a few seconds, then went dim. Not sure where it went."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23456.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23456.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"37.966543"}
