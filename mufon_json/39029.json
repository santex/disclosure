There were multiple V shapes which performed this way at various starting and ending points in the sky. At the highly of this display there were at least three or four shapes performing this consistently. The entire anomaly took about 10 minutes to complete. I was 10 years old at the time, the youngest person to witness the event. Several adults also witnessed this event with one still living. Other adolescents can also verify my account. After all these years I wanted to offer this first hand account for review and recording."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/08/2012 09:54 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Stafford","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39029.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39029.html"],"Region":"Texas","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"29.654678","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Stafford","There were 5 other sightings in Stafford on or around August 2nd 1962"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Longitude":"-95.594088","Object Shape":"Circle, Other","Log Number":"US-06082012-0052","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"39029","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.654678,+-95.594088(39029)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39029) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/02/1962 08:30 UTC"}
