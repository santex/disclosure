Hesaid he saw a ufo above us. i didnt believe it and thought he was kidding. Mynephew got up and turned around saying that i had better turn around. I did, andwas stunned - it was a glowing orange object above the tree in our neighborsyard but a distance away . As I looked it appeared to be stopped and thengetting larger. I feared it was coming in closer. It almost appeared to bedayglow - extrewmely bright. I backed off and my nepphew jumped over the deckonto a golf course as it began to slowly move. It then shot across the sky anddissappeared. I have not been able to find another report of a sighting in thisarea since then. I know it was something very unusual as it seemed static,glowed unbelievably and appeared to move towards us and then to the right."],"Case Number":"3000","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"glowing orange oval","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Longitude":"-111.632089","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Flagstaff","There were no other sightings in Flagstaff on or around June 28th 2003"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Arizona","Date Submitted":"06/28/2003 07:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.209522","City":"Flagstaff","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.209522,+-111.632089(3000)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3000) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3000.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3000.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Date of the Event":"06/28/2003 07:15 UTC","Log Number":"","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
