A couple shooting stars, sattellites, airplanes. Then, right over the top of us, very high in the sky a triangular light very bright moving across the dark sky. Still at a very close enough to continue following speed, we all saw the same thing....it poofed and disappeared into thin air. I did take a photo on my iphone and interestingly the pictures up close. 1.) looked exactly like the bright bright moving object (triangular) then the other two photos looked like a round tube looking thing (grayish with a light).... so, anyway wondering if there were any other reports that night."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-95.04774"}
