I only watched it for a couple of minutes be fore it dissapeared behind some clouds. Where I live the air traffic usally follows an east west pattern, this was clearlly going south and it was about 2 degrees from 12:00 high so it was almost over head. It appeared to be small and disk shaped very shinney as when the sun hit it it shined like a star, and it was moving in a ver jaged line but still south."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.828999,+-71.403464(22893)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22893) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Log Number":"US-04192010-0008","City":"Providence","Longitude":"-71.403464","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/20/2010 02:10 UTC"}
