I quickly noticed it wasn't moving, it was just sitting in one spot. After about one min. I ran inside the house and grabbed my camera. When I came back outside I began capture it on video. During the time I was grabbing the camera and got back outside there were two and then they just sat there and slowly formed a line and I didn't actually see any movement but they strangely increased in numbers approx. 6. Then I ran inside and looked and looked for my binoculars (no luck:( though) and when I returned the clouds were starting to cover them And I never saw them again :("],"Region":"Oregon","Date of the Event":"07/17/2011 07:17 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
