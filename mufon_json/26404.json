It was then that we noticed something gliding at a slow, constant speed, across the sky. The ufo was in the shape of a boomerang, and it was very large. I thought that maybe it was a plane but it did not resemble any plane in existence. I did not see it as having any lights, and it was completely silent. The edges of the UFO seemed to be rippling. It was very low, almost as if it had just taken off. I watched it for a good 5 minutes before it blended in with the night sky and disappeared completely. I was never afraid of the object, but I was very curious."],"City":"Aventura","Log Number":"US-11062010-0014","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/06/2010 01:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.964091,+-80.137392(26404)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26404) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida"}
