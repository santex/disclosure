A new type of blimp that has wings. Looks almost like a regular commercial jet, but much larger. Smaller than a normal blimp as in structure height. It may be very likely that is what I had been seeing lately, but I wonder why there are no anti-collision lights on the craft when it flies at night? The blimp-plane craft was seen flying in Mesa, Arizona on April 5, 2010 around 10:04AM. It was 2 to 3 mile in distance from where I was observing. This is the first time I seen this type of flying craft."],"Longitude":"-112.065027","Latitude":"33.456887","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04052010-0013","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around April 5th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"04/05/2010 10:04 UTC","City":"Phoenix","Object Features":"Wings","Region":"Arizona","Date Submitted":"04/05/2010 06:22 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Blimp","Summary":"Blimp with wings","Sighting Duration":"00:11:00","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.456887,+-112.065027(22655)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22655) map </A>"}
