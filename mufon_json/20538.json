I noticed the light on November 15, 2009 @ 1:30A.M. it was directly to the south of me. I live in Brandon, FL by I-75 and Causeway Blvd. The light appeared to be above the Sun city center area at first, by the end of the night it was over Apollo beach or the sky way bridge, I know thats a big differance but i'm not a pilot so i'm not really sure were its location would be. I checked were the International space station was at that time, I also checked were GPS and other satellites were at that time and they were not in the area. Some of the pictures are blured because I didnt have the camera on a tripod. I have a good camera its a Sony 15x optical zoom 8.1 mega pixels. I took the pictures on my porch that has a screen on it. If you could check out the pictures and video and let me know what you think I would appreciate it. Thanks chris."]}
