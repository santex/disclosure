At about 11pm I gave up looking and was putting my gear away, when my wife shouted quick look. I turned but it was too late I had missed it. She said she had seen the Biggest UFO she had ever seen a little bigger than the size of a good full moon. But this was only about a mile away, at tree top hight. She said it was massive, it passed behind the trees, from left to right as was a very bight white light with glowing green ora about it. As it was si low, it dissapeared before I could see it. BUGGER!! From her description, it was travelling in the same type of direction this other guy said he saw one a couple of weeks prior. I wonder if it's a regular landing area for them, very unpopulated and is dense forest and a small lake in this area."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31616.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31616.html"],"Case Number":"31616","Date Submitted":"09/07/2011 03:18 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"29.6193","Log Number":"BG-09072011-0010","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:00:06","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"59.7522","Region":"Leningrad Oblast","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
