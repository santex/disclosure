The dogs were barking and I thought a deer might be out there. I had my camera on burst and was holding the shutter button down. I took two pictures one after the other. The first one had this black thing in it. The second it's gone. I don't know what it is. I only saw it that night when I downloaded it on the computer. As I was looking at all the photos I had taken that day I found something else on the mountain top. The second picture shows the black something on the mountain. The last one is it moving away and a better shape to it. They move so fast that it would be hard to see them with the naked eye."],"Date of the Event":"06/27/2008 07:04 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.302422,+-82.470179(11369)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11369) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"Black oval with two tails with white on the beginning or a light","Country":"United States","Case Number":"11369","City":"Jonesborough","Latitude":"36.302422"}
