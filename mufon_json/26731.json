I was watching a bright light in the sky for a couple minutes, and I thought I would take a picture with my cell phone out of my car window. This photo is not the sun!! It is the bright light I saw that day. The school on the left is by my house. I don't remember much about the incicdent except it was a bright light. After looking at it more closley it looks like a typical saucer shape. My phone is just a regular cell phone nothing special about it. I have seen this type of ufo before typical saucer shape except it was horizontal not like this photo and it wasn't shining like this one. It was just old looking metal, hovering over the intersection in broad daylight, my son saw it too, he was in the passenger seat of the car. This picture is straight off my cell phone of the bright light I saw. It looks like it was about to take off. I had to turn on another street so I lost it."],"Case Number":"26731","Region":"Utah","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/31/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26731.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26731_submitter_file1__ufo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26731.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.61606,+-111.929283(26731)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26731) map </A>"}
