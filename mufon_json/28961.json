Upon longer inspection I realized that it was not a plane. I can easily tell what makes a plane a plane. This light had no navigation lights or any other lights so I know it wasn't a plane or helicopter. It was just at first an orangish light. It was just hovering in the southern sky. After looking at it for about a min. it started moving in a southeaster direction. It started off slow but picked up speed and was moving faster than a plane and as it did the color of it changed from orange to a light blue and then finally a white color before it disappeared from my view behind the tree line. It is a cloudy night and the clouds are low and this was below the clouds. It also made no noise. Seeing it really freaked me out a little. Once I pulled into my drive I quickly got out of the car to see if I can see it still but there are a lot of trees around my house and it had disappeared behind them. I cannot stress this enough, but I know it wasn't a plane or helicopter."],"Date of the Event":"05/05/2011 10:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-08012011-0040"}
