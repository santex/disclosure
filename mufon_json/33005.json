It was a very cold clear night so naturally I was gazing at the stars. It was between 11:48 and 12:00 when the first craft silently glided right over my house a little higher than the trees. It was a dull solid like transparent triangle about the size of a small jet covered In small orange lights. As I began to freak out my girlfriend thought I was losing but less than 2 min later the second one a little farther out and higher flew over. She caught a glimpse of it before it went out of sight in the tree line. It was a smaller triangle transparent craft just like the other but the lights were aranged in a different pattern. Larger and less of them more of a dull grey blue."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33005.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33005.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/30/2011 11:48 UTC"}
