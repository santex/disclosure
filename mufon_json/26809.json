{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI just got of of work, and was going to my mothers house. I stoped at the light at jefferson and woodward downtown Detroit, I looked up just over the builings and saw 6 ufos together and one about 100 yards behind the six, they were only about 1 or 2 hundred feet above the builings. they looked like they were maked out of aluminum. The light changed, and I drove under cobo hall to Jefferson and droved to the river, I got out of my car and watched them turn towards the ambassador bridge moving slowly, I watched them go over the the large part of the bridge on the canadian side. there were no windows or doors and the sky was clear."],"Case Number":"26809","trends":["There have been 56 other sightings in Detroit","There were no other sightings in Detroit on or around June 15th 1978"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-83.040284","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"06/15/1978 10:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.333277","City":"Detroit","Region":"Michigan","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26809.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26809.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.333277,+-83.040284(26809)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26809) map </A>","Object Shape":"Egg","Date Submitted":"12/01/2010 02:25 UTC","Summary":"Seven ufo's above Detroit on a clear moring.","Log Number":"US-12012010-0007"}
