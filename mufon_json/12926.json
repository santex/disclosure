I proceeded to gather my friends and family to witness the event. They were baffeled by the sight of this also.We were amazed by the sighting,however we had previously seen another object Approx. one year ago,but that one was of a different shape(large triangular shape)so we were not totally shocked,but our friends were shocked because they were non-believers until this incident enlighted them. We lost sight of the object as it continued to slowly head towards the west."],"Date of the Event":"10/06/2008 07:45 UTC","Latitude":"38.071619","Region":"Virginia","Summary":"we witnessed a spere-like object","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Waynesboro","There were no other sightings in Waynesboro on or around October 6th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.071619,+-78.888258(12926)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12926) map </A>"}
