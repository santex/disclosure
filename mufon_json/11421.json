I am an ex military paratrooper and Pathfinder. I have seen and jumped out of just about every military aircraft in service, and have never seen anything like this. Large Black rectangle with lights (smaller) on each of four corners underneath, one larger, dimmer set back from front two and centered, with large red beacon rotating in center. First was at about 2,000 ft (i know as Ive jumped from that level), second in half hour later as we watched it descend through 8,ooo ft to about 4 to 5,000, level out, move east and then begin to rise at about 8 miles out over Bristol, TN. Both moved at 45 to 60 knots going East to West along Interstate 81 and Lee Hwy. First went right over my head on Beverly Drive in Abingdon and others saw them as they passed directly in front of us at an insanely close distance. Sincerely, Dennis J. Wisnosky Jr."],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Bristol","There were no other sightings in Bristol on or around June 23rd 2008"],"Latitude":"36.598126"}
