{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn October 21st 2011 I was visiting family out in Mesa, Arizona. At that time I was actually almost done my 2 week vacation and doing what I did after dinner almost every night there, which was looking up at the star constellations and showing my young 5 year old nephew what stars were which constellations when I noticed there were 2 stars out of place, they shouldn't have been in the Little Dipper at all. These 2 out of place stars were not there a couple minutes before when I looked up the first time after dinner before my young nephew came out. Both Star-like objects flew in a straight path across the sky and then disappeared, there was no sound or blinking lights like an airplane or helicopter, there was no engine sounds. There was a small airport near my brother where small planes and helicopters flew in and out of but these were 2 shining round star-like objects too far up and too bright to be airplanes or helicopters."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"2 starlike objects appeared in middle of star constellation and flew in a straight path then hovered again and vanished","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.339351","Log Number":"US-10252011-0020","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32873.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.339351,+-111.590593(32873)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32873) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Mesa","There were no other sightings in Mesa on or around October 21st 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"32873","Date Submitted":"10/25/2011 11:06 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-111.590593","City":"Mesa","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"10/21/2011 08:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
