It looked like a greenish white light that arced over the trees. It was first a thick line then mushroomed to a sphere-like object that collapsed back to the thick line and continuing arcing toward the ground. I yelled for my daughter to look to the north and she observed the same object. The line then mushroomed once more into a sphere like object and then collapsed into the line again arcing toward the trees. That's all we saw.
