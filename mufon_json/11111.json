It was mostly dark at this point. I was talking to my four year old about the moon when I noticed a very fast bright moving object in the sky. This object was very bright and had no flashing FAA lights at any point. My wife and nine year old also saw the object. The object was moving from northwest to southeast passing over Albuquerque. My son and I kept watching this object till it just vanished, nothing was blocking my view of the object when this took place. My nine year old and I had full view during the entire event and never lost sight till the object just vanished from the sky, not that it went out of our view....It just vanished! We never heard any sounds at all from the object even at its closest point."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"06/09/2008 09:15 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Fast moving ball of light that just vanashed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.086641,+-106.647527(11111)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11111) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/09/2008 09:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-06102008-0001","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering,Other","trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were no other sightings in Albuquerque on or around June 9th 2008"],"Longitude":"-106.647527","City":"Albuquerque","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"11111"}
