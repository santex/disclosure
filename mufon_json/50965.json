My girlfriend and I saw them in the distance and as we got closer we ended up directly underneath them. They hovered above our head for about two minutes. The orange orb on the left disappeared and one on the right cover approximately ten mile in about two seconds. We first noticed the objects because of the orange glow. At first glance we thought they were helicopters until we got underneath them and they were not moving but just floating. I was shocked and intrigued at the same time. I lost sight of the object after it moved too far off in the distance."],"Longitude":"-79.374867","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50965.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50965.html"],"Latitude":"40.319333","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Latrobe","There were no other sightings in Latrobe on or around September 21st 2013"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Case Number":"50965","Object Features":"None","Region":"Pennsylvania","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"09/21/2013 09:09 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
