{"City":"Grand Rapids","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend Onie and I were outside at approx. 9:30 and I noticed what looked like a Japanese Floating Candle in the distance. I took notice because of the brightness of the object. When I saw the second one appear over the horizon, I alerted Onie to the UFO's. He immediately repeated that I thought they were (Japapnese Floating Candles) but at this point, they were moving pretty fast, linear and they were not blinking. As they passed directly overhead, the deep amber orange was very noticeable. I watched them fade into the night sky. From a rational perspective, they did not feel 'otherworldly' they seemed man made. had they moved at strange angles I may have concluded 'alien' however, definitely Unidentified. No photos or videos were captured but I speak the truth and I have a witness.
