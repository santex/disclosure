Father was driving and said what is that. We pulled over, me and my younger brother jumped out and viewed 3 orange-red lights, hovering very far away. they were in a straight diagonal line, at an equal distance from each other. ~10 seconds out of the car the top light disappeared, ~20sec after that happened the bottom light disappeared and then about 10 secs after the last (middle) light disappeared. They were all moving east in the sky at the same rate after the small, bottom light had caught up. While viewing we made sure it was not a star, then I squinted to make sure I could not see blinking lights like an airplanes. I just couldn't believe this was finally happening to me."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"05/12/2012 11:04 UTC","Summary":"3 Orange objects, Equal distance from each other in a straight diagonal line.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Minneapolis","There were no other sightings in Minneapolis on or around May 12th 2012"],"Longitude":"-93.26667","Region":"Minnesota","Log Number":"US-05122012-0015","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Date of the Event":"05/12/2012 09:35 UTC"}
