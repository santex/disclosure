So i quickly ran to my 2nd floor deck to find 5 or 6 more comming up through the tree line from the east. Thought i was seeing a plane at first , but lite was different than anyplane i've ever seen, I live near two airports and know my planes.I thought rite away ufo. I've lived here for 44 yrs and never seen anything like it! At first i was a little scared but became worried when i had seen how many there was!I saw the objects for approx 10 min! then they flew out of sight."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
