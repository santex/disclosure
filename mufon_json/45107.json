The object was a very bright white light. i thought it was a plane due to the fact that it appeared to be moving in a straight line, but it was moving very fast so i took a closer look. It flew very fast in a straight line for about 5 seconds.Then got even brighter before taking a hard left and disappearing a second later. i immediately asked my girlfriend if she seen the object she freaked out and said \"yea what was that\". after that i knew that we had seen something phenomenally paranormal. i continued driving along, recalling the incident in my head and with my Girlfriend."],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/08/2013 08:50 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
