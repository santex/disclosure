It does that for about thirty seconds to a minute. Then it starts gliding toward us with no noise at all so we go out side to follow it. It seems like it's going to crash in our front lawn and goes right over a tree. It sailed over the trees and my sister and I thought it was going to crash into the lake. It was so close I could see the reflection in the water and I noticed that it was definitly not an airplane. It was oval shaped, had red and yellow lights, had three spikes, and a faint turquis glow at the top of the craft. It is Easter morning that I am writing this and I had the encounter last night."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28796.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28796.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.934838,+-83.627572(28796)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28796) map </A>","Case Number":"28796","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Grand Blanc"}
