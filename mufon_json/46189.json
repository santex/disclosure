Very high rate of speed. We got a quick look at it and suddenly it disappeared. It was beautiful...unfortunately we didn't see it for very long. We, my husband and I were very shocked to see it...had never seen something like that! It was definitely some type of UFO."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46189.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46189.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
