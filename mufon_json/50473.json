As my sons bus came he got on so I walked back home whit my other two children. Five minute later as my second son and I were sitting on our porch I noticed a shinny object it was getting closer it had no noise to it and it was shinny then as it was coming just above my neighbors house it just dissappeard (pulsated). After that there was a helicopter flying around the area where everything took place. Let me just say that this is now the fourth time that I've seen these orbs around the neighborhood. But I must say why in the world would any (ET)come in my area! There is nothing even worth picking up there."],"Longitude":"-78.858823","City":"Buffalo","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere","Region":"New York","Date Submitted":"09/06/2013 01:38 UTC"}
