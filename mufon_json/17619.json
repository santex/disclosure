I looked up and saw two flashing lights. Red and white. They did not move. I observed for about 10 min then ran in to get my camera. At first I thought they were planes. But there was little to no movement. One moved a little more than the other. When I got back out only one was left as far as I could see. I could not get a picture. My screen was black. I continued to watch it. Very little movement. It would move at slight angles very short distances. I ran into my house at 2:30am, and when I came back out it was gone."],"Summary":"Two small red and white flashing lights that did not move in the sky.","Longitude":"-75.2824","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17619.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17619.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/23/2009 02:30 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lower Saucon","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/23/2009 02:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Lower Saucon","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"40.606211","Case Number":"17619","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
