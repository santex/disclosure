Now I have the knowledge and know it was a UFO and couldn't be any normal craft. At the time I was going to bed and when I looked out of the window I notice a red triangle in the sky. The triangle wasn't red in whole but the edges were bright red, I'm not sure if the main body was transparent or black. It remained stationary in the air, no noise, motionless. When I lef tthe window and looked again it had vanished."],"Country":"United Kingdom","Latitude":"53.77213","Summary":"Red Triangle UFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.77213,+-1.77305(46249)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46249) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Bradford","There were no other sightings in Bradford on or around October 18th 1999"],"City":"Bradford","Region":"","Date Submitted":"03/17/2013 05:28 UTC","Longitude":"-1.77305","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"GB-03172013-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46249.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46249.html"]}
