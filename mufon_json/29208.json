{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my friends were hiking up a popular trail in our community, Mt. Umunhum. We sat down to take a drink and eat the 3 bagels I had packed, I updated my Facebook status from the spot using location, so my location at this time was (37.16373,-121.898511). I had finished my food when I looked up at our subsequent destination through a clearing of trees, that's when I saw a large shadow covering the monument on top of the Mountain, I wondered, \"What on Earth could make such a big shadow?\". So I sprinted a few yards ahead onto a rock to get a better view, initially I didn't see it, but I soon began to make out a triangle or square in the sky through connecting these hovering lights. There were around 9 lights that were arranged in a triangular or square way, the lights were yellow. They cast a shadow all the way across the peak, then shimmered away. By this time my friends had walked to me and seen it too."],"Case Number":"29208","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29208.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29208.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"San Jose","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.340606,+-121.892636(29208)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29208) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/22/2011 05:11 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-121.892636","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were no other sightings in San Jose on or around May 22nd 2011"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Triangle","Log Number":"US-05222011-0024","Date Submitted":"05/22/2011 09:14 UTC","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"37.340606","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"While taking a hike, I saw a triangle of 8 lights in the sky above Mt.
