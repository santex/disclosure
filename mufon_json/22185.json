Upon seeing them noticed that there were 4 lights, above but slightly to the west, moveing in a patern and although I could not see beams going up I thought they were large ground lights from the nearby fair grounds. As I was searching to the west trying to see light beams going up from the ground my wife said, \"and what about that\" and pointed, to the southern sky at about a 45 deg. angle, at a clearly defined, round, lit up, object moveing from the west to the east. Although it was moveing quite fast the speed did not seem particularly abnormal at the time. The main aspect that was unlike anything I had ever seen was that the light was not bright like airplane lights but more subdued and the light was clearly contained inside the circle. It was in view for about 5 seconds before it went behind a tree and by the time I moved to continue viewing it, it was gone from view. I immediatly realized I had never seen anything even remotely like this before and was quite perplexed."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22185.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22185.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Phoenix","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around March 6th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/06/2010 10:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/07/2010 01:26 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.456657,+-112.070127(22185)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22185) map </A>"}
