There was also a commercial plane in the sky that gave us a good point of reference. The plane is also what made us notice the object in the first place. At first the object just looked like another plane, but its characteristics proved otherwise. The object moved at least 5 times faster than the plane, and performed dives impossible for a commercial plane. The object darted erratically at impossible vectors, and would stop and change direction without slowing down or gradually turning. It seemed to change colors between red, blue, and yellow though it was mostly red. At one point the object flew very close to the plane and there was a brief fear that there might be a collision. A close friend and I watched the object for 20 minutes while it weaved it way across the clear night sky from a starting point of due west until it disappeared behind the cliffs to the south."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
