This was not unusual due to the fact that the kent county airport is not far away. I continued to watch the light move at a very slow pace. once the light reached a clearing in the trees The object stoped moving and then began to increase in brightness. As the object increased in brghtness it appeared to grow in size. The light then rapidly dissapeared within seconds. It appeared as if the light went into a tube or as if you could watch a light move thru a tunnel, but a speed unmatched by anything I've seen before. After seeing the object I called My father and sister. I also tried to call the local airport but was unable to get through to anyone."],"Latitude":"42.97066","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14736.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were no other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around July 2nd 1999"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01042009-0013","Country":"United States","Case Number":"14736","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Grand Rapids","Date Submitted":"07/02/1999 11:54 UTC"}
