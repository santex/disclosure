Off in the distance over santa barbara a pulsating light was flashing red, green, and white. At first I thought it was a airplane, but I quickly realized it was dancing around in an erratic manner yet staying in the same relative area in the sky. zig zags, circles, and different light variations made me and my friends positive it was not an airplane or helicopter. As creepy as it was I could not look away, so I continued to stare at it for the next 30 minutes, watching it dance and slowly get smaller. The object slowly moved lower on the horizon until it slipped behind some trees."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Star-like","Country":"United States"}
