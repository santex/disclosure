A feeling of slight fear arose. I then lay down in bed just before remembering my sunroof of my car was open. I get up and get dressed and walk outside. An awning covered my view of the object until I came around the corner, to go down the stairs. As soon as the awning revealed the object in the sky, I see it move downward and then vanish. At this point the fear I had been feeling vanished as if everything was perfect. After I close the sunroof I remain outside and watching the sky for a few minutes. I didn't see anything more. The object seemed to be within a quarter mile of me and no higher up than maybe 60, falling to maybe 45 feet before disappearing. From the distance I perceived, the object seemed to be approximately 2' in diameter. It made no noise. I am sure what I saw was not a shooting star, lightning bug, or anything I can explain. I���m planning to camp out on my porch for a little while each night with my camera. I���m hoping Ill spot it again."],"Latitude":"28.629447","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-81.360304","Tags":"City"}
