Saw a few shooting stars streaking for a few seconds, but after 5 minutes or so, witnessed a grouping of about 6 or more starlike balls of not very bright light, not blinling, in a kind of loose, circular formation from south to north across the sky around 80 degrees until they went over neighbors buildings. Looked like how dandelions carried by wind, not in a straight line but fluttering, wave-like at times. At first I thought am I really seeing this, looked away and back and saw it again. I've never seen anything like this and it looked like the lights that were filmed over sf a few nights ago. I actually retrieved my phone to film but was too dark. Not sure how high but definitely in atmosphere, lower than visible stars but higher than low clouds."]}
