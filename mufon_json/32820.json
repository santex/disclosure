{"Log Number":"US-10242011-0004","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside of my house smoking a cigarette when I saw what looked to be an extraordinarily bright airplane flying at a relatively slow rate, about the pace you'd see a typical airplane flying if not a bit slower. Eventually, after roughly 5 minutes of my observation, it stopped dead. It was blinking steadily orange while it moved, but once it stopped the blinking became less frequent and the color seemed to change to its own star-like white, eventually blinking very sporadically. By far the brightest object in the sky. It remains stationary as I type."],"Region":"New York","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/24/2011 01:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.732908,+-73.69392(32820)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32820) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32820.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32820.html"],"Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"32820","Summary":"I saw an extraordinarily bright airplane flying at a relatively slow rate, about the pace you'd see a typical airplane flying but a bit slower.
