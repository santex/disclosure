Was looking at the stars overhead through some broken clouds. Some movement caught my eye right overheard. First though it was meteor. Then six objects came into view overhead flying toward the west. There were two groups of three objects flying in a two tight, parallel triangluar formations. They glowed (or relflected city lights) a lighter blue than the surrounding sky. There was no decernable sound from the objects. First thought it was birds, but the formation was too tight and birds don't fly that late. They moved across my field of view in a few seconds behind the neighbouring house. Altitude was difficult to gauge but they were flying below the broken clouds overheard."],"Case Number":"48987","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Lethbridge","There were no other sightings in Lethbridge on or around July 15th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"07/15/2013 11:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"49.689493","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/16/2013 01:30 UTC","Country":"Canada","Region":"Alberta","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.689493,+-112.89847(48987)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48987) map </A>","Longitude":"-112.89847","City":"Lethbridge","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
