{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/05/2012 05:41 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe security camera detects motion and sends a series of photos to my email. I found these photos strange as the light appears to be hovering right over the front of my truck. Where the object is over the truck there is a block wall so no light could be coming through from the other side or the road. No one is aware of the camera so I don't feel anyone was playing games with it. I went out and tested it the next night with a mag light to see if I got the same effect. I did not, not near bright enough or large enough. I think this is from something hovering. The road is not in the line of this light either and judging from the series of photos the camera took I do not see any movement that would normally show from the road. There are lights way in the background from other houses but they should be much higher in the photo. They also don't show up this bright or big on the camera. The only other possibility for this photo is a UFO. Note: I do believe I used to be abducted as a child and young adult and feel this may be an attempt to keep tabs on me as I did just move to this house two days prior to this sighting. I did not directly observe this but so the witness I refer to in the check box portion of the report is the camera. I was only able to upload 2 photos of the object here. I do have a series of six that show no movement slow enough for the camera to capture. Upon speaking to the neighbors they had no traffic in the driveway that morning even near that time."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"Washington","City":"Port Orchard","Log Number":"US-04152012-0008","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37489.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37489.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.516063,+-122.596471(37489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37489) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-122.596471","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Latitude":"47.516063","Case Number":"37489","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Port Orchard","There was one other sighting in Port Orchard on or around April 5th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 2 times.",""],"Date Submitted":"04/15/2012 12:35 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"This is a series of photos taken by a security camera mounted on the front of my house.
