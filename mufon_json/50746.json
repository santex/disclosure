I was facing street. Over my friends head I notice something over buildings but was blurry, like transparent. I told my friends but the joke about, than on my right side I see it again and one friend got a glimpse. My other friend had his back and moved quick his neck and complain the pain and didn't see... we paid attention to him for that split second and the ship was gone... There was no color, or reflection, or sound. Just a big thing semi- visible. Had not windows I think but something like square patterns in front and the back kind of look the same or different design. Shape I saw flat maybe some smooth curve in front and back... cant be sure... was hard to look since you could see the background in some areas."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/11/2013 11:52 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Rockville","There were no other sightings in Rockville on or around June 20th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09112013-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.085697,+-77.151688(50746)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50746) map </A>"}
