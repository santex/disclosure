{"Longitude":"-77.144568","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/21/2009 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were driving to go to Montgomery Mall, and just made a right turn coming from Tower Oaks Blvd to Montrose Ave. and to take the 270 S. exit. I then pointed out to my wife an odd looking object (driver side) hovering just above the trees. I initially thought it was just a plane. But, looking at it closer, it was definitely clear that it was something different. The unidentified flying object had 3 white lights from each point of what appears to be triangle shape object; it also has a flashing red or amber light in the middle. The object was just hovering and not moving at all, and without making any noise. It also looked like it was a bit tilted to the right side. I then made a U-Turn from Montrose Ave. that we can see the object even more, but right after we made the turn, the object disappeared."],"Region":"Maryland","Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"39.091657","City":"Rockville","Date Submitted":"05/21/2009 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Rockville","There were no other sightings in Rockville on or around May 21st 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05232009-0019","Summary":"UFO sighting by Montrose Ave.","Country":"United States","Case Number":"17094","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17094.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17094.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.091657,+-77.144568(17094)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17094) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
