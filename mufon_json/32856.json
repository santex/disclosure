We watched it for about 20 minutes, and then it changed direction and began to move east, where we observed another one, and then 2 more which just seem to appear out of nowhere. Once they met up, they passed one another, came together as a group and then climbed into the atmosphere and dissapeared. The entire event took about 30 minutes in all. I live in the flight path to Chino Airport, which is a small municiple Airport, and the Ontario International Airport, so I am very accustomed to seeing aircraft flying overhead. They seemed to be flying above the airplanes, which are on descent by the time they fly over my home."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
