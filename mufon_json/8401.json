It was right around 5:10 pm on a Monday. We stopped at a stoplight and saw a hovering bright white light in the sky to the right - west - over State Route 16. It was daylight out, although it was cloudy. It was weird - almost impossible - to see such a bright light in the daytime. I pointed it out to everyone and we were all staring at it. As we watched, it seemed to turn to the left in mid-air and the light moved over horizontally, kind of like an eclipse and became a silvery dome-shaped object. I said, \"Omighod. Did you see that?\" We all agreed but then the stoplight turned green and we took off and turned east on the highway. We couldn't see it anymore, although I continued to look in the sideview mirror and out at the sky. I've never seen anything else like that in my life."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Granville","There were no other sightings in Granville on or around October 1st 2007"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"10/01/2007 05:10 UTC","Case Number":"8401"}
