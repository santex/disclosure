The lights were very noticeable due to there not being a lot of light on this stretch of road. At first sight I thought it was a plane but I saw what looked to be three lights in a triangular pattern, just above the clouds, swaying from left to right. Wasn't a plane and COULD NOT have been a searchlight, this area is very rural and the chance that someone was simply shining a searchlight into the sky in the middle of the country is slim to none. I asked a friend I was with if she saw the same and she did, neither one of us could figure out what it was but other than that, continued to drive to our destination. The lights were still in the sky when we turned onto my road but on the way back out later, saw nothing."],"Object Flight Path":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45017.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45017.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"three lights triangular shaped hovering in the sky","City":"Cleveland","Region":"Texas"}
