(we waved at it!) ten minutes later, one of the three bright stars moved at more or less the same speed of the jet if not faster. it moved in the straight line but then suddently turned 90 degrees from its direction immediatelly like an l. it then travelled into the clouds fading with its brightness.. it must have been gone 2-5 minutes or so when on the totally different side of the sky it re-appeared very bright but then slowly going dim. it then travelled away in a straight line however wavering occassionally along the way. dissapearing into the clouds. this star like thing was travelling very fast all the time. it was very high up as it seemed to be with the stars. me and my friends weren't scared at all we were all intregued however my girlfirend ran inside the house. we took our phones to record it but it was too dark for the cameras to work. it was identical to a star. on the way back home i was thinking could of been a foofighter but that was impossible as otherwise we could of heard a jet and there was no way we could of seen it. i don't know if it is a new plane or anything but if it is then raf. wittering would have picked it up on radar. if its not a u.f.o could you please tell me what plane it was as i'm very intreaged and never seen anything like it. yours faithfully"],"Date of the Event":"07/13/2009 10:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Diamond, Star-like"}
