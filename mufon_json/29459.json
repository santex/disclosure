At first I thought it was two planets close together till the top one got brighter and the bottom one went out completely. Within seconds the other was gone. I was shocked and asked the others in the car \"Did you see that??!!\" and sure enough they saw it too. They really stood out in the sky. Hopefully some fellow wichitans saw the whole event since most are out and about for the festival. Wish I had gotten some photos, we even kept driving around trying to catch a view of where they went."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Wichita","Log Number":"US-06082011-0012"}
