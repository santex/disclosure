Anyway, they live literally in the forest without too many neigbours...but UFO was seen by many others and even videotaped by someone - a little further from where my family lives. It was even in the news, but obviously they say that it was some kind of spacecraft from NASA...hehe, in this remote area, in Hungary...well, the younger son of my sis told by watching the object: ah yes, it is only a ufo - you dont need to be afraid...meanwhile the bigger was a bit scared.
