Although the star did not shoot across the sky, rather it just fell very slowly almost like debri that was on fire. As the ball of light continued to fall\"slowly\" the ball split into 5 little light spheres that stopped in mid fall and separated and formed a horizontal line. The spheres on the left and right started to flash on and off. The five re-formed where the two flashing spheres flew up above the 3 and formed a pyramid shape. Than all 5 started to descend to the ground. At that point I lost eye contact. I was able to snap a few shots with my iPhone that are not very good but maybe someone who has experience can tell what it was."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","City":"San Diego","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.765448,+-117.12316(43222)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43222) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"One spehe turned into 5 little spehers. formed a straight line. formed a pyramid shape 3 spheres on bottom 2 flew on top. 2 on top werte flashing.
