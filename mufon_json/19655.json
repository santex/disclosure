There were no flashing lights and it never changed course. It looked like a satellite only it was too low for that. It turned from white into red and then disappeared. Immediately following this object was a very high flying plane that appeared to be looking for the object. We watched this object for at least 8 mins. It was definitely not a plane, made no noise and when it disappeared it was almost like it went into warp speed and vanished or burned out."]}
