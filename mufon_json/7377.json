{"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was practice for the 2005 Air & Sea Show in Ft. Lauderdale beach, I work in Opa-Locka Airport where the jets are stationed for storage and practice before heading off to the beach. I was just taking pictures of the Thuderbirds practicing by our facility and DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING. When I went to my computer to see the photos I came across this one and THERE IT WAS! A real UFO, it can't be the other jets because they were flying in patterns behind the two in front doing the manuever, and this thing looks nothing like an F-16. This is genuine and freaky, if you are a photo analyst please look at this photo with professional scrutiny and let me know what you think, thaanswerv@hotmail.com"],"Latitude":"25.902317","City":"Opa-Locka","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"04/29/2005 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.902317,+-80.250327(7377)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7377) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Real UFO Sighting, next to military aircraft!!!","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.250327","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7377.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7377_submitter_file1__Airshow2005OPF016.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7377.html"],"Case Number":"7377","Object Shape":"Disc, Egg","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Opa-Locka","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-07062007-0004","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/29/2005 12:00 UTC"}
