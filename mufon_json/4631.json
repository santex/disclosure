{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Tahlequah","divs":["sighting detailsi was on delmar road, about three miles out of the town of tahlequah, driving home from dinner that i had with my friend jake and his wife denise when a big flash of light startled me. now, we were in the middle of a thunderstorm watch so it wasn't to be unexpected. but what really confused me was the color of the flash, a bright blue. after the flash, my truck experienced difficulty, total difficulty, in fact it stalled right there in the middle of the street. besides the truck, i noticed that my watch and my cell phone were powerless too. i got out to check out the engine of my truck and i heard this looping sound very similar to a harley davidson, but i was all alone on the road. no one in sight. well, my heart was up in my throat when i looked up in the sky to see this big blue disc-shaped object. it had to have been that object making the noise, and the more i heard this noise the more it sounded less like a motorcycle and the more it sounded like this weird metallic\\electrical sound. i know this is going to sound stupid, but the best way to describe the sound is the sound that those ships make in those matrix movies. the thing was just hovering there for the longest time, i stood as still as possible. as the only thing living in the area that i knew of, i didn't want to draw attention to myself. i've heard to many stories about abductions to try and be a brave man now. after what must have been five minutes, the object started going back and forth across the sky. i ducked down, i wanted this to be over. then after a couple minutes of this hovering over the area, it disappeared in the same fantastic blue flash that it came in. as soon as the flash had disappeared, my truck turned back on all by itself as did my cell phone, but my watch was still broken. i know the encounter took 7 minutes and 11 seconds because my watch was stopped at 8:50:49 and when i got into my truck, the clock just turned to 8:58. my phone was another story. when i looked at it, there were 40 missed calls, all of them unknown. i called a few of my friends, including my friend jake asking them if they had seen the object and had called me. but all i got were laughs and confused reactions. i'd like to forget this whole experience, i feel as if i'm going crazy. i saw something about mufon on the history channel, so i thought i'd give you this story to add to your records. i hope that telling the story to someone who wants to hear it will get it out of my system and i can continue living my life."],"Sighting Duration":"00:07:11","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Tahlequah","There were no other sightings in Tahlequah on or around April 1st 2006"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/01/2006 08:51 UTC","Summary":"Big flash of blue light, hovered for several minutes, darted around the sky, and then disappeared in flash of blue light.","Country":"United States","Region":"Oklahoma","Log Number":"US-04042006-0008","Disposition":"Hoax","Date of the Event":"04/01/2006 08:51 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Flash, Saturn-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.92089,+-94.967026(4631)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4631) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.92089","Longitude":"-94.967026","Case Number":"4631","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4631.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4631.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
