Randomly taking pictures of whatever was around me. I took this photo trying to capture the sun going down between the trees. After I took the photo I looked at it on my phone and thought that it was part of the glare. Then I moved it around and saw the spot was still there. I then thought it might be something on the lens or the screen of my phone and so I rubbed it and it didn't go away. I looked up in the sky and saw nothing nor any hint that anything had been in the sky at that moment. It was a super clear day so not even clouds could hide something up in the sky. After a moment, it dawned on my that what I saw in the photo looked an awful lot like a triangle and reminded me of photos I'd seen before of UFOs looking just like it. Long story short. I felt certain that I had just caught a UFO on my camera. Or better yet, a UFO had made itself visible to me."],"City":"Lexington","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.501756","Disposition":"IFO"}
