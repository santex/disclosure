They appeared to be glowing almost like a hazy plasma flame around each craft, all the craft were flying north in close staggered formation less than 500 feet from the ground and the size of each craft is hard to determine, but I would say about the size of a small aircraft . I was scared , I ran inside and told my mother who was a skeptic and grab my camera, I ran outside with my mother and took a few pics but I was nervous and shaking to get a good shot and they were going away by the time I can get a good shot lined up, they blink out one at a time, I snapped 4 pics in normal mode and in night framing mode only one shot came out decent, I could not believe what I just witnessed and then all 4 appeared again at 9:36 pm in the same formation and going in the same direction as before , this time I was ready with the camera, I took close up shots, and they show the plasma flame around each craft. I have 9 photos in total showing different formation flying, I am an aerospace engineering student who studies engines and different forms of propulsion and I know these were not conventional aircraft by any means.4"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.638185,+-89.390558(7427)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7427) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Illinois","Summary":"4 orange glowing plasma shperes in lemont IL","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07132007-0006","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7427.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7427_submitter_file1__ufo006.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7427_submitter_file2__ufo007.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7427_submitter_file3__ufo009.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7427.html"],"Latitude":"40.638185","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"7427","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
