I then gave the glasses to my son to look and he noticed objects in a differant area of the sky and thought they may be falling because of the way the were fluttering. At first there were four objects and suddanely one vanished. I then observed the objects through the glasses and noticed they seemed to remain in a triangular formation for the duration of the sighting. the objects eventually just vanished. To me and my son they looked like two litter bottles tumbling."],"Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in El Paso","There were no other sightings in El Paso on or around September 27th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/27/2011 07:16 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
