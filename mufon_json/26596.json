As soon as shegets back outside i zero in on it, all tho it was blurry from being so far away i could make out a cigar shape with a wider rear which was where the flashinglight was coming from. it wasnt like a comercal planes lights, it blinked in slow intervals an i could see it in day light as clear as if it were at night. after i was done looking at i handed my mom the banoculares so she could see it, she looked at it for a minute or two an it just faded away."],"Log Number":"US-11152010-0012","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"cigar shaped an blinking orange","Country":"United States","City":"Redding","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.59216,+-122.387975(26596)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26596) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"26596","Latitude":"40.59216","Longitude":"-122.387975","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/14/2010 04:14 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/15/2010 06:04 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
