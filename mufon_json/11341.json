I was showing my cousin how to spot orbiting satellites. As we were looking up and towards the west we were both shocked when suddenly three evenly spaced meteorites, side by side, grazed our upper atmosphere from north to south with tails that reached from approximately 50 degrees azimuth to approximately 120 degrees north. We simultaneously looked at each other briefly then back at the sky only to be amazed by four more UFO's trailing with identical characteristics. Estimated speed would be in the neighborhood of about 10,000 mps, or, or 36,000,000 mph. BELIEVE IT OR NOT I DON'T CARE. If any one saw what I saw 34years ago I would like to here your story."],"Summary":"Seven meteorite like objects with long tails, in formation(3 followed by 4).","Log Number":"US-06292008-0004","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Flash, Star-like, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"New Mexico"}
