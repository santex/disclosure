I went outside to check it out. It was to my south and fairly low to the horizon. It was stationary and at first glance looked like a star, but I noticed it seem to change color and pulsate. I went and got my son and some binoculars. My son saw it as well and we both thought it could be some sort of unidentified flying object. Through the binocs you could tell it was changing colors, pulsing, and stationary and seemed closer and larger than the stars."],"Latitude":"44.94329","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"48598","Object Features":"None","Region":"Minnesota","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.94329,+-93.658212(48598)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48598) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48598.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48598.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 12:00 UTC"}
