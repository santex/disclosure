I saw a hot-pink, shimmering,needle-shaped object in the Southern sky. The color was intense and really caught my eye. First I thought it was an airplane , or something . I kept looking at it and realized this wasn't an airplane. It remained stationary, then at times it would make side to side movements then moved back to it's original position. It remained verticle the entire time. I was exited and shocked, I didn't even think of getting a camera. It remained in the sky about 15 minutes. Then it slowly faded until it disappeared. I put my finger close to my eye and measured the object about an inch. This is my second UFO sighting."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Kendallville","There were no other sightings in Kendallville on or around July 4th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/04/2007 12:00 UTC","City":"Kendallville","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-85.264975","Date of the Event":"07/04/2007 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-07052007-0008","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7373.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7373_submitter_file1__lastscan.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7373.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"7373","Tags":"City","Summary":"Needle-shaped"}
