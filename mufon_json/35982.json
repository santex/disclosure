Just getting dark I was in Orlando @ freedom High school in my semi when I noticed a bluish green orb dancing around in the sky over a heavily populated area. The orb would rise and fall and move from side to side and to a far distance and back. I watched this for 2-3 minutes until it just went away. I was approx 1 mile from it. It averaged 50' to 300' in altitude. I did get 2 videos and 1 picture."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
