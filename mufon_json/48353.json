I went back into the house, and my neighbor came over, beating on the door saying \"They're Back!\" my mother ran out and came back in and told me \"Come Look! there are UFO's Out there! Come Quick!\" I saw at least five lights in a line taking up most of the western horizon heading northeast dissapearing, one after another, as another appeared over the horizon in the west. UFOs because of the color and there was no sound at all There were at least 20 lights in the sky total, red orbs totally soundless, but my mother said she could hear a humming noise. Traveled in a perfectly straight line, except for the last four, they were offset. I felt Intrigued, and told my mom to go get the Video Camera. My mother felt happy that other people saw it. I lost sight of the object when it dissapeared over our heads."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"48353","Object Shape":"Egg, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"06/22/2013 10:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Prospect","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Prospect","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48353.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48353.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06232013-0016","Summary":"more than 10 lights in the sky","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Date Submitted":"06/23/2013 10:09 UTC","Longitude":"-80.045577"}
