I was driving on US 10 east toward Riverside, CA. I am not sure of the time but it was late evening or early morning. Traveling east near Ontario, Ca. the sky is unobstructed and you can see the sky very well. As I was driving a bright flash of intense green lit the sky in front of me. The flash had shape to it, not just a blob of light. It looked as if a GIANT laser was flashed for less than a second. The flash was maybe 15 or 20 degrees off the horizon and flashed upward in direction. I know the Hubble telescope had been launched around that time so it more than likely has something to do with that, but it left quite an impression on me. There were no reports of anything on the news the next day that I could find and no one I talked to the next day saw anything either."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/31/1990 12:00 UTC"}
