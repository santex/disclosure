Saw three lights in the sky at 930 pm outside my house in nh. It was going southeast then after like two miles past us it turned around left to northwest.. this lasted like tem min. There were plans flying as we are in flight path but this was not a plane that we no of today. Was low to the ground within 1000 up. And it was big. Triangle shape. Three amber lights . This is nuts. We live near powerlines and sumkind of power station. They call our town the three river city. These two things may have something to do with this or its a Gov test thing. We do have national guard station here and see military aircraft. Also the hospital gets medical air traffic up the hill. So that's why I'm so shocked to see this with no aircraft warning lights. No reports on scanner of plane issues in area.
