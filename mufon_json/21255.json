{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy female companion and I were vacationing in Paris and decided to go to the Sacre Coeur cathedral, which is up on a hill and provides a nice panoramic view of Paris. A few minutes before, I had commented that I had not seen any planes flying over Paris while we were there. When I took the shot, I saw nothing unusual in the camera and neither me nor my friend heard any noise. She took a similar photo with a conventional SLR film camera, but zoomed in more to downtown Paris. If you look in the foreground, no one is looking up, as they would have if a plane were flying so low and so nearby. Later, back at our hotel, we were looking through the shots we had taken that day and saw the object in the photo."],"Longitude":"2.356032","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"FR-12292009-0024","Region":"Ãle-de-France","Latitude":"48.858704","Date Submitted":"12/29/2009 09:29 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Chevron","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.858704,+2.356032(21255)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21255) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/15/2009 03:27 UTC","Case Number":"21255","Summary":"UFO over Paris","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21255.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21255_submitter_file1__DSCN0456.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21255.html"],"Country":"France","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Paris","There were no other sightings in Paris on or around November 15th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Wings","City":"Paris","Source":"MUFON"}
