Object was seen stationary for approximately 5 seconds. The white cylinder object was reflecting a white bright glow. The object then released a secondary white light that began from the left and moved the right-end of the object (similar to a copy machine light scan). When the bright light reached the right side of the object, the cylinder moved at high speed to the Western sky. The fast movement of the light created a temporary light trail to the naked eye for a second. The cylinder then became stationary in the sky for another 5 seconds before a large bright flash engulfed the cylinder itself and disappeared from the sky."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.239077","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder"}
