Lined up object behind radio tower. Moving too slowly to be an airplane. Not likely a drifting bag either. I was riding my bike up San Bruno mountain, Radio Tower Road. Was a very blue sky, near the airport, where I often notice air traffic, and noticed this light brown object, as described above. I kept looking up at it, as I was riding up the mountain, and I kept re-spotting it, and noticed its movement, as described above. It was hurting my neck to look at it, so I looked away from it for half a minute. Also, though it appeared to be about twice as high as the local jet traffic, one jet may have gotten closer to it, and caused it to go away, or move. In any case, I was not able to relocate it."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.785661","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-119.412142","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Distant brown object, slowly drifting, above San Bruno mountain towers, about 10,000.","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/24/2006 07:30 UTC"}
