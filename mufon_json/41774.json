They came over the hotel to our right which was much lower than ours. Two first--we watched them until they just blinked off...or went behind the clouds..the third one came from same direction, seemed a little brighter and just kept going overhead until we couldn't see it anymore from our vantage point. They made no sound, all came from same direction and went in same direction. The most noticable thing to me was their color and brightness, about the color of a lit cigarette at night. Strangest thing I've ever seen!"],"trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Myrtle Beach","There were 4 other sightings in Myrtle Beach on or around August 8th 2012"],"Latitude":"33.69157","Region":"South Carolina","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08152012-0016","Date of the Event":"08/08/2012 09:30 UTC","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"41774","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Star-like","City":"Myrtle Beach","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
