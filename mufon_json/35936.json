{"Summary":"blinking or pulsating red light really high up in the sky. heading west. almost starlike","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy boyfriend and I were outside smoking on the back patio. I was noticing on how clear the sky was in we were pointing out stars to each other. Out of the corner of my eye i saw this red flashing and pulsating light. It was so far up it looked star-like. I didn't really know what it was. It seemed to not be making any noise at all. I have never witnessed anything like this it was a little exciting. It was going in a straight path heading west. My boyfriend and I watched it until it dissappeared behind the houses. I had to immediately go straight to my computer and do some research and here I am. I wish i had a camera to record this amazing event!"],"Latitude":"35.341705","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/19/2012 09:53 UTC","City":"Moore","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-97.456469","Region":"Oklahoma","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35936.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35936.html"],"trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Moore","There was one other sighting in Moore on or around February 19th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"02/19/2012 08:25 UTC","Case Number":"35936","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.341705,+-97.456469(35936)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35936) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02192012-0016"}
