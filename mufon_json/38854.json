We both assumed at first it was a star but then it began to alternate colors between red, green and blue. At times the whole object would appear white and then begin changing colors. We watched the object for nearly an hour. Then it just disappeared. We did not witness it move. It was as if someone just turned the lights off and it was suddenly not there."],"Date of the Event":"05/27/2012 09:25 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-06032012-0079","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Latitude":"35.91783","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Durham"}
