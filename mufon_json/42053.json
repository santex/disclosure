At first I thought it was a helicopter , but I didn't hear any noise . The feeling I had of the object was that it seemed at first a common thing , but then it seemed kind of odd and out of place . I lost sight of the object as the outside edges of the light shrunk inward and disappeared . It was a round light with sharp defined edges and kind of a dull shade , the light was not bright and it didn't shine down to the ground , it was just kind of THERE ."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date of the Event":"08/05/2009 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.695887,+-104.922234(42053)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42053) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"42053","Log Number":"US-08272012-0002"}
