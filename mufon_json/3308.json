I did not see anything at the time, but after the film was developed my wife noticed the objects high in the sky on the photo. Under examination with a magnifier the objects appear to be five spheres decending in size from left to right, the largest one being brownish in color in its entirety, while the other four are brown and white. These objects appear on the negative as well."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","Summary":"Not Provided","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/01/2005 06:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3308","Date Submitted":"02/01/2005 06:10 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.23811,+-81.841801(3308)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3308) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.23811","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-81.841801","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3308.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3308.html"],"Log Number":"","Source":"MUFON"}
