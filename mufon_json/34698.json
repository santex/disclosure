I was sitting on my scooter on the corner of US Hyw 41 and symmes rd. InGibsonton, Fl. I looked up and observed 3 metallic balls flying around in the air approx 1000ft high. They were staying connected but moved around each other. They were maneuvering in a figure 8 pattern but kept changing the leading ball. In other words they were revolving around each other as they patterened the figure 8. I would have to estimate them to have been 20-30 ft in diameter. One was almost black and the other two were silver. They reflectd the sun. It was a cloudy day so I could only see them in a break in the clouds. I watched for about 15 seconds."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34698.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34698.html"],"trends":[],"Case Number":"34698","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-01072012-0016","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.667157,+-81.510874(34698)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34698) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Gibsonton, FL spheres figure 8 pattern","Longitude":"-81.510874","Date Submitted":"01/07/2012 11:56 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States"}
