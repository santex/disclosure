She then started to get nervous, so I shut the tail gate, and saw something at my 1 oclock flying around in the low clouds, it was red the lights didnt flash but they seemed to strobe in a fast circle, and it was making absolutley zero noise, it started moving slowly from side to side, and the next thing I know it just vanished, I waited for probably ten minutes for this thing to appear on the other side of the small cloud but it didn't, and I was sober. I believe in UFO's not as a Alien space craft but government planes, but seeing how freaked out my large dog was Im definitley convinced that it was weird."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09252008-0006","Date of the Event":"09/25/2008 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/25/2008 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12774.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12774.html"],"Summary":"I was leaving my girlfriends house at 1AM","Longitude":"-110.358186"}
