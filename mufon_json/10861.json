On my way back to bed I passed by a window and noticed the fog and brightness on the moon outside. I stopped to look as I have seen things before . Looking Southeast I saw a bright star looking object about the size of a tic tac at arms length away. It was a warm yellow orange light hovering about 45% above horizon. It looked to be a lot closer that a star would appear and bigger. I would say about the height of most planes. I watched it for 15 minutes then showed my husband who didn't care. I felt ok observing it. I wish to be contacted by Evelyn .I lost her number have her call me."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.809836,+-75.06071(10861)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10861) map </A>","Region":"New Jersey","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Gloucester Township","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
