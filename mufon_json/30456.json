They disappeared into the night. They crossed the road I was traveling near my home in a residential neighborhood where I was babysitting for my Daughter and her husband. I then tried to follow them but trees blocked my view. I went around the block and comming up the same road only a minute later near my house I saw them again in a repeat of the first sighting that was exactly the same. This time there was a car parked on the road with a man and a woman who witnessed the sight. Very strange. Also viewed by my Son in Law. A liutenent in a local police force here who lives three blocks from me. That's it. I called 911 and they said there were no other reports of a sighting up to that time I called. They said they would send a police car around. No other info. Not yet anyway. Possible photos from my son in law."]}
