I was surf fishing at wrightsville beach. when I happend to notice 2 planes in the sky over the ocean and also a round metallic object between the two planes. It appeared to be hovering but also to be spining as on the rotation a section of it reflected from the sun. I turned around to my mother who was watching the waves and asked her if she had her glasses with her she said no I turned back and the object was still there. She asked me why and I looked back at her and said come look at this. When I turned back it was gone. I did not know about all the sightings around wilmington until I got home and looked on the internet. I then decided to report it."],"Region":"North Carolina"}
