I noticed odd flashing lights moving very slowly north. I was able to pull over and get out and for roughly 5 mins. I observed absolutely no sound what so ever coming from the object. I was close enough to tell that it was not a balloon or anything like that. It was moving at about 20-30 mph. and about 500-600 ft. in the air. The lights were white and a reddish color that flashed intermittently almost in the shape of a delta or triangle. I couldn't tell the shape only that it was close and very creepy as it made no noise at all."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.473397,+-82.739336(14762)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14762) map </A>","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14762.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14762.html"]}
