We were in a field of a friend who lives south west of Newtown, PA, Bucks County. I was facing north. I know which direction I was facing because I just finished playing with the Go Sky Watch app on my iphone. A fireball the color of a bright green stoplight flashed in the sky and disappeared into the tree line. My friend next to me looked at me in disbelief. We were the only two who saw the object. It was only visible for a second or two."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
