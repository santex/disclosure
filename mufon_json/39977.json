They would have a pulsating effect, from orange to white, and so on. Did not move together, but each had own random, and often changing, path. Before having to run in from an impending storm, one of the lights seemed to show more details, possibly being made of three lights, and it might have been in a triangular shape, but I didnt have enough time to affirm--clouds soon obstructed any and all view of the night sky."],"Date of the Event":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"39977"}
