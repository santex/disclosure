At first I thought it was a satellite, but as I looked I noticed that it had no defined edges and was moving too quickly. Also I have not ever seen a red satellite. I urged my friend to take a look and we both witnessed it move across the sky. My friend saw it change direction, moving in a non-ballistic manner, travelling faster than anything we have seen in the night sky. Both my friend and I were puzzled as we watched the object move across the sky. It moved left, and then back to the right, and the disappeared beyond the horizon."],"Case Number":"31266","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Winnipeg","There were no other sightings in Winnipeg on or around August 29th 2011"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
