it went in all directions. i would estimate that if it was 10,000 high it was probably moving maybe 200 feet in each direction around the point where it had stopped. it became difficult for me to watch the object with my head sticking out the car window and looking over the roof of the car to my west, so i made a u-turn and parked along the curb. i could now see the object by looking out of my window toward the west. shortly after i parked, i phoned my wife to tell her what i was seeing. my cell phone indicated that i called my wife at 2353 hrs. on 7\\16\\11. just after i started talking to my wife, the object stopped zigging and zagging and it began to move toward the east. just then, another police unit with two officers pulled up and asked what i was doing. i ended the phone call with my wife and i informed the officers about the object that i was watching. we then exited our respective vehicles while we watched the object. both officers saw what i was seeing. one of them believed it to be an aircraft. the other officer said she wasn't sure what it was. as we watched the object continue east, we noticed an aircraft far out in front of it, also flying east. the object and the aircraft appeared to be around the same altitude, but the object had become so dim that it was hard to determine how high it was. in fact, several times the object's light appeared to fade out completely and then quickly fade back in. however, at no time did the light of the object appear to flash or blink. all three of us watched the object move east and, once again, it stopped in mid flight and began to zig and zag around the point it stopped. the one officer continued to believe that the object was an aircraft, and the other officer said she didn't know what it was. then the other officers had to move their vehicle because they had stopped in the travel lane and they were blocking traffic. i got back into my vehicle and drove east and parked in a parking lot one block east of my original location where i continued to watch the object. it continued east and its light faded in and out a few more times. i lost track of where the aircraft, which i had seen in front of it, had flown. then i received a call for service from my dispatcher and i had to leave the area. the total time i watched the object was approximately 15 minutes. later that night i looked to the sky in the direction i last saw the object but i didn't see it again. through the course of the night i did see two meteorites, one to the north of town over the lake and one to the south. however, i am familiar with what meteorites look like and the object i watched was not a meteorite. later in my shift i tried to call the local international airport to see if they had any aircraft or any other contacts on radar at that time. but i only got an automated system and was never able to get through to anyone there."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Longitude":"-80.079689","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Erie","There were no other sightings in Erie on or around July 16th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Erie","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30329.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30329_submitter_file1__Sighting_map.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30329.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/16/2011 11:52 UTC","Log Number":"US-07242011-0011"}
