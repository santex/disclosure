I watched it travel in a straight line then meander in an angle left then circle around, it was about the size of a Lear Jet, because one cam by at about the same altitude 10 minutes later. This was definetly NOT a plane or helicopter as it was completely silent and iluminated in a very bright plasma green light. I watched it travel across our city for about 15 miles until it dissapeared."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/06/2011 08:47 UTC"}
