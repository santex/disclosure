I wanted to grab my camera but it was moving fast and only had 30-45 sec to view before I lost sight of it due to distance I'm glad I viewed it for as long as I could without distraction. My feelings were that it was a very curious site to see. I star gaze almost every night and have never seen anything like it or move like it did. After I lost site I texted my friends and family and went online to see if anyone else had reported the shape and characteristics of what I saw I'd never heard of this shape before but it seems to be somewhat common"],"Object Shape":"Triangle"}
