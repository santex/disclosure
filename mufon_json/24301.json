I had let my dogs outside to use the bathroom and was star gazing. I witnessed something that flew directly above me that had 3 soft blue or grayish orbs in the shape of a triangle. It was at very, very low altitude, <= 400', cruising about the speed of a small single engine plane. It made NO sound whatsoever, and was veering right, at a curve. It was a very very quiet night, and I live in town, at the time there were no cars out and it was pretty much silent and cold. When it passed me overhead, it appeared that the orbs made a circle and twisted around each other one time. Then it almost immediately dimmed until I couldn't see it anymore. It was definitely a singular craft of some sort, not 3 individual objects. The whole event lasted 6 seconds at the most. My reaction was one of fear. I had a sense of static or being watched. I ran inside and locked my door in fact."],"City":"Vincennes","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"07/07/2010 12:36 UTC","Log Number":"US-07072010-0003","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24301.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24301.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
