I thought it was extremely strange because I knew immediately it wasnt a star. I thought it mightve been Jupiter or a radio tower, but there was a tower just a few miles away and it blunk red, not white. It just stayed there, then my friend noticed that it had moved to the right. We were just hanging around and talking, staying in the same spot. We used a jungle gym to see higher and noticed it was very brightly twinkling. I had recently taken an astrology class and could easily identify this as nothing Id studied. We stayed for awhile, watching it trace the mountains outline very, very slowly. Fog came over us and the light was dim for a short bit. It went away and the UFO hovered over a lower part of the mountain side. It stayed like that for a few minutes, then descended into the forested mountain."],"City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Hovered over mountain, temporarily covered by fog, traced mountain silouette, then descended into forest.","Date Submitted":"01/06/2012 09:11 UTC"}
