At one point a flash of light attracted my attention and saw a moving \"star\". At first it was like a normal small star but while watching the light got very bright like the North star. This event took no longer then 5 seconds, then the light went dimmer until vanished from my line of sight. I don't know exactly what I saw but as I know a landing light of an airplane is only used when landing and this did not have the airport trajectory. And I guess that the landing light is not week at first then increases in intensity then goes dimmer."],"City":"TimiÃÂoara","Tags":"City","Summary":"Flash then like a shooting star at first, then got brighter then dimmer and slowly vanished.","Longitude":"21.237499","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/03/2013 03:43 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/02/2013 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Region":"TimiÃÂ","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"RO-07032013-0010","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Timișoara","There were no other sightings in Timișoara on or around July 2nd 2013"],"Latitude":"45.755539","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like"}
