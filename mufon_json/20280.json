{"Longitude":"-83.22598","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving from Webster, NC on Webster Rd, and I saw an orange ball larger and brighter than a star. It was going straight at a fast speed, about the speed of a shooting star if not slightly slower, towards (I think) the North. I was beside Ingles almost at the stoplight when I stopped my automobile and stuck my head out of the window. It was still moving and it looked to slow down for a moment before it went out of sight behind a hill (I'm in the mountains). I have no idea if the change in speed was because of the altitude and angle. It went in the direction of the Sonic Drive In and the Ford dealership. I looked at my phone and the time was 2133 hours. I was excited to see whatever it was. I thought it might be the space station. I got back to my home around five minutes to ten and checked to see where the space station was. At the time it was over the Pacific Ocean. I use to work on aircraft and what I saw was not a regular aircraft, if indeed it was an aircraft. I am in no position to say it wasn't natural."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/02/2009 09:33 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.373711,+-83.22598(20280)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20280) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11022009-0020","Region":"North Carolina","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"20280","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Sylva","There were no other sightings in Sylva on or around November 2nd 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.373711","City":"Sylva","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/02/2009 10:56 UTC","Summary":"orange light crossed the sky over Ingles in Sylva","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20280.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20280.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
