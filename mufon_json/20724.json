I thought they were the ones I always see there but they were to bright. I noticed they were moving from the north and went east. They started out side by side and ended up behind each other. The distance between them stayed the same. The lights didn't blink and there were no sound. I tried to get them on video and they were moving faster over the house. I ran out the front door to watch and video them as they went towards Erwin over the mountain. That video didn't show. I felt agitated, and stressed right afterwards and still am a little. I was disappointed I didn't get better video. I lightened the video and will change it if you need."],"Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"11/25/2009 08:46 UTC","Latitude":"36.300462"}
