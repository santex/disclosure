They remained there for a bout half an hour or more. Sometimes they would disappear and reappear. Other times they would move lazily next to each other or farther apart. It started with one and then others would sort of blip in and out of sight. They were either very shiny or white and very reflective reflective. While they were in the sky no planes or helicopters were around, but once a plane came they all disappeared and helicopters flew around overhead."]}
