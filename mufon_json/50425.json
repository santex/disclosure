It caught my attention when I noticed that the object didn't appear to have wings. I was looking at what seemed to be a huge white pipe flying higher and faster than a commercial jet. I asked my brother in law if he seen it. He said yes. I asked if he saw wings. He said no. I later found out that my mom said that she has been seeing them for a couple of years now. I would like to find out what this was."],"Case Number":"50425"}
