I quickly realized it was not a plane, there were no flashing lights. This was 4 lights in the form of a rectangle all the same distance apart. It's height I would say was the usual height of a regular passenger plane. But travelled much faster. The sighting lasted for around 3-5 seconds - maybe less. I have no idea what it was - It was there.....Then gone!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Observation lasted just 3-5 seconds","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.180123,+121.436175(43073)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43073) map </A>","Longitude":"121.436175","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Square, Rectagular, Star-like","Date of the Event":"10/07/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Shanghai","There were no other sightings in Shanghai on or around October 7th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/07/2012 07:56 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"31.180123","Log Number":"CN-10072012-0006","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Shanghai","Country":"China"}
