{"divs":["sighting detailson 08\\02\\2011 i was sitting on my back porch looking at the sky. the night was clear, no haze and normal air traffic was abundant. i saw numerous \"regular\" satellites passing overhead as well. about 2204 hours i noticed a light appear about 45 degrees above the horizon to the south. at first, i thought it was an iridium satellite, as it grew in intensity and size to a brilliant yellowish color. about 1 to 2 seconds later, a second object appeared behind the first, following the exact path of the first. the objects were separated by a space which was approximately the width of my thumb at arms' length. the second object got increasingly brighter, surpassing the brilliance of the first by a small margin. unlike iridium satellites, these two objects remained at peak illumination for maybe 5 to 10 seconds before fading. my impression is that the objects were self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun. both objects seemed to veer slightly to the northwest as they passed overhead. both objects faded out one after the other and could not be seen anymore. i checked the heavens above website and discovered that there were no iridium satellites or other man made objects in the vicinity at the time of my sighting."],"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"08/02/2011 10:04 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30757.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30757.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/09/2011 02:07 UTC","Summary":"2 bright lights passing overhead","Longitude":"-117.380578","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Riverside","There were no other sightings in Riverside on or around August 2nd 2011"],"Latitude":"33.987395","Log Number":"US-08092011-0085","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Riverside","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.987395,+-117.380578(30757)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30757) map </A>","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"California","Case Number":"30757"}
