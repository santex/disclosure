It was much higher than the jet and moved a lot faster too. After about 3 minutes it was out of our sight. Then about 20 minutes later I seen a cigar shaped white ufo that was a lot closer to the ground than the other one. This one was flying in a straight path at first until it abruptly stopped, hovered for about 20 seconds and then completely vanished as if a bubble popping. It didn't fly away, it just disappeared completely!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32294.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32294.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Latitude":"42.315195","Region":"Michigan","Log Number":"US-10022011-0025","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Battle Creek","There were no other sightings in Battle Creek on or around October 2nd 2011"],"Object Shape":"Cigar, Circle, Sphere","Longitude":"-85.164363","Date of the Event":"10/02/2011 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/02/2011 09:16 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
