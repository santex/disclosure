We were driving south on 86th and I saw the object, then pointed it out to my wife. I stated \"whats that\", then I said a \"UFO\", (the sun was above the horizon and to our right) she looked up at it, and also noticed the sun reflecting off of it. It was headed north east, and we lost sight of it due to trees. We don't have any feelings, or reactions to seeing this, But my main action is to make a report to MUFON. Again, we lost sight of the object due to trees."],"Summary":"Travelling south on 86th & Urbandale, my wife and I looked up and saw a metallic cigar shaped object with sun reflecting off of it","Date of the Event":"10/10/2012 06:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Urbandale","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.635476,+-93.710116(43135)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43135) map </A>","Region":"Iowa","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43135.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43135.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.635476","Case Number":"43135"}
