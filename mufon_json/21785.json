Our email is scorpion1@fuse.net. I will try to copy and paste what I wrote below. First let me say that my husband is a big non-believer in UFO���s��� He drives a truck from Ohio to Laredo, TX every week and has just called me to tell me that while driving down Interstate 35 (South) in TX, he saw a bunch of flashing lights and all of a sudden it started moving quite fast and in many different directions and then took off so quickly he had barely blinked and it was gone. The closest I can explain as to where he states he saw this UFO out in the desert of Texas is as follows: Interstate 35 South between mile markers 74 and 77. He stated that it was very close to the interstate by him. He states that he had just passed mile marker 75 when it disappeared a few minutes ago. (10:20pm EST) I believe that is 9:20pm Central time in Texas. The towns I can see on our maps for these mile markers are Millett and Gardendale, TX. If you have anyone else call in or contact you about this sighting we would be appreciative as he is freaking out about what he thinks he actually saw as I said before, he is a non believer until now. He thought it was an airplane until it started moving in all different directions as it got closer."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"21785","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21785.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21785.html"],"Summary":"Saw flashing and extremely quick motion in many directions and then gone.","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.020397,+-102.380146(21785)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21785) map </A>"}
