I try to name planets, constllations, ect. three weeks ago i see a an object slightly pulsating and hovering high enough that at first you think its a helicopter but it was there for hours at a time and appeared 2-3 times a week. And it didnt twinkle like the other stars did. Living close to newark air port i've seen my share of planes and helicopters. Looking at it with a childrens beginner telescope its as if you roll up white christmas lights in a ball and turn them on. Its a white sphere with small white flashing lights in the middle.I stared for hours and its still there when i go to bed. IT ALSO appears that the stars and planets move on their normal orbit but the object stays in the same spot in the sky. I think its pretty cool but my wife and kids are like big deal."]}
