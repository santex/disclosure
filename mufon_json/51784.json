just as the moon begins to rise over the hill behind me about 45 minutes from the start. i have been able to watch this show for the last 3 nights with such regularity, that i have risked looking totally nuts and invited friends to come witness this strangeness. so far they have not let me down. everyone who has seen this is stunned and cannot believe what they are seeing with their own eyes. it defies any explanation so far. everyone leaves stating, ���wow, people will think i���m nuts if i try to explain this!��� luckily, i am 3 for 3 in the ���not nuts,��� department with those i have dragged out to witness this. i will continue to invite others nightly, until it ceases to happen. i figure that the more people i can show this too, the faster we can come up with a rational explanation of whatever this is. yes, i have tried to take pictures, as have my friends, but for the last few nights we all just have our phones and they just don���t do it justice. plus it all is so exciting that as we fumble to his the record button and get it into view, you really don���t want to take your own eyes off of the scene as you struggle to make sense of it all. its quite spectacular and, unfortunately, it all happens pretty rapidly. tomorrow morning i am headed to phoenix to buy 2 good quality video cameras and tripods with the hope that i will get at least one more good night of this amazing show to record in a couple different ways. i���m hoping that night vision might reveal some shape other than just orange orbs \\ ���fireballs.��� i live in a very rural area, but i am 60 miles from luke air force base. my sensible head says that this must be some sort of secretive military project being tested in a rather remote location. that said, it is still directly overhead, and quite blatant to those looking up in a rather populated area. if this testing were shifted 3 miles to the west, it would all happen in a desolate 60 square mile area, separated by mountains and populated with maybe 100 inhabitants."],"Date of the Event":"10/23/2013 07:00 UTC","Latitude":"33.969766","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Date Submitted":"10/24/2013 02:21 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10242013-0002","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Wickenburg","There were no other sightings in Wickenburg on or around October 23rd 2013"],"Case Number":"51784","Summary":"8 Fireballs - 4 stationary blinking sequentially & 4 moving independently","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","City":"Wickenburg","Longitude":"-112.730188","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51784.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51784.html"]}
