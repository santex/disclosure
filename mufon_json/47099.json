AFTER A FEW SECONDS I DETERMINED THAT THIS WAS TO LOW IN THE HORIZON AND THE SPEED WAS TO SLOW. I OBSERVED IT AS IT APPROACHED ME, IT WAS A YELLOW GLOWING SPHERE THAT ALMOST APPEARED TO BE ON FIRE, AS IT CAME CLOSER TO ME IT SLOWED DOWN AND TURNED DUE NORTH ( 0 DEGREES ) AND PROCEEDED TILL I LOST SIGHT. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT DID ANOTHER PASS IN THE SAME SPEED AND DIRECTION APPX. 5 MINUTES LATER. THIS HAD ALSO OCCURRED ON 8-30-2008, OBSERVED BY A MOTORIST TRAVELING EAST BOUND ON I80 MUFON CASE # 12347."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Minooka","There were no other sightings in Minooka on or around April 29th 2013"]}
