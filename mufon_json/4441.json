I went out on my kids large back back porch to have a cigarette. I was looking north and it looked like it was a mile (or less) away. There was hardly any wind - it was around 4 - 4:30 PM - and stll light outside. It was round & was hovering - it looked like something was spinning on the bottom. It was huge - about 40 feet diameter. It hovered about 5 minutes - then moved to the right (East) about 3 times its' width and turned bright red - looked like a ball of fire - fringed all around like it was burning - this lasted about one minute - then it just disappeared. I didn't call the family out to see it - they were playing with the grand kids so there were no other witnesses. Just wondered if anyone else saw it - anyway -"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02172006-0005","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Date of the Event":"12/25/2005 04:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4441.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4441.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/25/2005 04:15 UTC","Case Number":"4441","Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"39.557901","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"I saw an object hovering looked like spinning on bottom","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-105.772887","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.557901,+-105.772887(4441)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4441) map </A>","Object Features":"None"}
