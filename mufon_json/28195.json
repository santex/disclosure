I noticed a bright white light. It went under another smaller white light. It looked like a star but seemed to low. I would say around a helicopter distance. I could tell how high it was because of the distance . Plus the plains are flat with out no mountains or construction it is the desert. The lights went out about a second or 2 after the small white light swallowed the light. . I noticed a blinking red light a short distance always from this. But I dismissed it do to the flashing lights on the towers and antennas that are common. as I made a right turn into 20th street east heading south. It happened again. It repeated it same. The weird part was the bright light moved in a wiggly pattern. towards the smaller light. The lights sizes were about a Xmas light and 2 led being one red. after the second one the red light remained. I made it home and was curious about the red light and told my kids to keep an eye out on it. It disappeared in the same manner the white ones did. The red light I can easily dismiss. But the 2 white ones are unexplainable. This happened on 3-10-11 @ 7;18 pm on the north side of AV in the direction of the western part of Edwards air force base. It was to close to the city to be anything I can think of being tested. Also the way it moved the bottom light in the squiggly manner makes me scratch my head."],"Date of the Event":"03/10/2011 07:18 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.688165,+-118.145073(28195)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28195) map </A>"}
