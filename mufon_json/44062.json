I'm surprised my daughter spotted it because it was hard to detect. At first I did not see it when she said \"shat's that?\", but after she asked again I saw what at first I thought was a fast moving lone cloud, but then it was clearly a black triangle when overhead and made no noise. It only had some faint lighting around the edges, which may have been reflection from the city below. It disappeared over some high cirrus clouds, so I assume it was very large. It was stunning to watch and now to think about what it could be!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-90.297962","Date Submitted":"11/21/2012 07:52 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Region":"Missouri","Date of the Event":"11/17/2012 06:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-11212012-0002","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"2 people see Silent barely visible triangle pass high above mid St. Louis","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.63265,+-90.297962(44062)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44062) map </A>","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in St Louis","There were no other sightings in St Louis on or around November 17th 2012"],"Case Number":"44062","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44062.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44062.html"],"City":"St Louis","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
