(will talk to neighbor soon for sighting verification making possible witnesses 3 or more)"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-01252013-0008","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Sinking Spring","There were no other sightings in Sinking Spring on or around November 6th 2012"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Date of the Event":"11/06/2012 11:39 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/25/2013 08:09 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"40.321787","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.321787,+-75.987877(45411)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45411) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45411.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45411.html"],"Case Number":"45411","Summary":"Starlike Bright/Pulsating then observed closer as a Bunch of White Lights"}
