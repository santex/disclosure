While waiting for her to do her business Ilooked up to see if any stars were out. It was cloudy in the East so I lookedback to the West to see beautiful stars. It was gorgeous. I found the bigdipper and started to look away when I noticed a row of about 10 amber coloredlights moving in a straight line. I didnt think too much about it and suddenlya second row appeared to form a V pattern. I kept trying to make sense of itlike maybe some kind of plane no, it was in a definate V pattern, a flock ofgeese no it was glowing amber lights and it was dead quiet. Just that quick, itstarted going sideways, one row of lights went out and then the next.There is no doubt in my mind it was some kind of UFO. There is no logicalexplanation for it."],"Date Submitted":"11/11/2002 04:56 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Benton","There were no other sightings in Benton on or around November 11th 2002"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.996716,+-88.920068(1971)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1971) map </A>","Region":"Illinois","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1971.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1971.html"],"Summary":"Never Imagined It Could Happen To Me","Date of the Event":"11/11/2002 04:56 UTC","City":"Benton","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
