I was driving to work one morning. There was no moon showing (it could have been overcast - I do not recall) as it was very dark. I was headed toward the ocean, going down a winding road. There were no trees or structures in the way. The object was quite large and just seemed to pop up over the ocean and just as quickly pop - was gone. It was so big you could not miss it. I had no idea what is was and still wonder if it ever happened to any one else at another time. I was very calm and not at all threatened. By pop up, I mean it was just there for a moment or two and it just wasnt there. It did not move."],"Region":"Hawaii","City":"Lani'i City","Latitude":"19.899546","Source":"MUFON"}
