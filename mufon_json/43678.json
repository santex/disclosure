Airplanes don't have that many lights and they are not as bright as these were then it just disappeared... this was the first one. About a mile down the road we witnessed the same exact thing then the third one was the exact same shape size everything.....I believe in aliens so I know that what I saw was an alien spaceship... too close to mistake it for anything else. All three of them just disappeared. All of the sudden, they were gone. I know they're coming and they're coming soon. I thought it was awesome and amazing."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Longitude":"-74.076248","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Plattekill","There was one other sighting in Plattekill on or around November 3rd 2012"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/03/2012 03:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.616455","Log Number":"US-11032012-0007","Date of the Event":"11/03/2012 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"saw circle with flashing red blue and white lights, hovered moved then disappeared.","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Plattekill"}
