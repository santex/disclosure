The odor disapearred mysteriously after i exited my shower. the day went normal from there until about 11ish. i was walking home from the town fair (which is a very rural area) and in the middle of a farmed field i smelt the odor again. i shrugged it off believing it to be air pollution. as i started walking thru a thicket full of raspberry's and willows and whatnot. the odor became very strong and intense all of the sudden. i then fell over sickened by its overwhelming power. my legs felt as if they were being pricked by needles. but the weirdest feeling was in all of my joints, i felt an intense pressure. almost as if ballons were expanding in my kneecaps. after about 45 seconds of this it abrubtly stopped. then a very deep rumbling sound came thru, almost shaking the very strong rooted ponderosa pines around me. i used my remaining strength to look up at a 45 degree angle and see a very large cigar shaped object flash with green lights. but then it flickeed and all of the sudden it wasn't there. almost as it had turned on an invisibility cloak. the sound slowly faded, but as i continued to look up i could still see flashes of light once in awhile being distorted by the invisibilty cloak. it took another 45 minutes till i was able to gather strength to walk to my house. it was almost like the ship had paralyzed me until it was far far away out of any danger. i experienced no later effects from the incident. p.s. just a note to add. when the ship was lifting off it had the strange resemblence to a human penis, i kno it sounds strange but it gave off that appearance. inclosed is a rough sketch of the encounter"],"Case Number":"11976","Log Number":"US-08082008-0003"}
