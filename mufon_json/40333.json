My daughter pointed out an object in the sky which appeared to be stationary. As we drove, it was periodically obscured by trees. My daughter thought it was rectangular, but when I saw it, it appeared to be a dull gray triangle. It did not appear to be moving. It was difficult for me to keep my eyes on it since I was driving. When we stopped at a red light, a driver in the next lane had to slam on their brakes, which made me wonder if the driver was watching it, too, and missed the light changing. When we turned around the jug handle on Route 38, the object was no longer in site. The object did not appear to be a blimp, balloon, aircraft or other explainable object. When we pulled into the Olive Garden parking lot, we could no longer see it. Only my daughter Gemma and I saw it; my daughter Kate, who was also in the car, did not see it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","City":"Cherry Hill","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/06/2012 06:30 UTC"}
