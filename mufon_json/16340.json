(crazy!!!!???)- we literally felt each other and patted ourselves and checked our door locks - we were floored! we also quickly conversed about the fact that no one would believe us, or what would we even say? i proceeded to take my friend to her boyfriend's house and drove home via a different route (as i needed to head back to kennewick). afterwards: i was not in the habit of reading newspapers at the time - but i picked one up for the next several days, expecting something about the sight\\event- i really really wanted a \"realistic\" explanation... but i also knew in my gut what we had seen was above any capabilities i knew to exist to aircraft - and that there was no celestial occurance or object that could even possibly behave or look like what we had seen. my friend and i did tell a couple people at the time - i think they pretended to humor us but frankly i did not feel that we were believed. i think we both quickly quit telling the story... over the years i have recounted the event to myself and very few others - all of the sights, sounds and feelings are as real today as if it is a movie in my mind. i have not seen this friend in ten years or so - but i am absolutely, 100% sure she would tell the same story, the same way to this very day. i know what we saw and how it moved. i may not be able to explain it - but the experience was as real and is just as recountable as the birth of my child, or a major accident that happened in my life and is permanantly seared in all it's details in my mind. has anyone heard of an event in the same area, around the same time???? thanks for \"listening\"."],"City":"Richland","Tags":"City"}
