It appeared to be traveling slowly, quickly changed position in the sky and was difficult to follow. At first I thought it might be a radio tower although this is a road I have traveled thousands of times and knew there wasn't anything like that in that area. Also the string of colored lights were at a 20-30 degree angle. When I was able to get to an area not as well lit with lights, I noted a faint outline of what appeared to be a triangular shape. I did see a single white light that was flashing like you would see with an airplane. I live near an army instillation and am used to seeing flying planes at night. I have never seen this type of light configuration and the shape. Does anyone have any idea if this is a ufo or just a plane?"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11302009-0017","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.974784,+-75.910756(20815)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20815) map </A>","Tags":"City","Region":"New York","Date of the Event":"11/30/2009 06:07 UTC","Longitude":"-75.910756","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"straight row of lights, faint triangular shape in dark star-lit night","Case Number":"20815","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20815.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20815.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/30/2009 08:15 UTC","City":"Watertown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
