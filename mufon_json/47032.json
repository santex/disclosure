{"Log Number":"US-04282013-0004","Summary":"while driving I noticed triangular object hovering above me and over electric lines, bright circular glowing light in middle with 4 pulsating lines","divs":["sighting detailsi was coming home from grocery shopping in crossville and headed west on highway 70 in the pleasant hill area. while driving, a large object appeared before my eyes, just above my vehicle. i noticed a large triangular type shape with a big lit circle in the middle of it. the light was several feet across and was illuminated with white light. the object looked dark gray as far as i could tell and the shape was triangular but with curves. i figured it must be a ufo to be just hovering like that over the power lines. i could only see the underneath because i was passing under it. i couldn't believe it was hovering over me a bit to the left and over the power lines. i observed the power lines were just a few inches underneath the object. it did appear to be coming closer to me. i also slowed down the vehicle a little so i could keep watching and ducked my head some to continue to see. i noticed 4 beams of light that went from one side to the other of the object and pulsed about 4 times on and off. the lights were about 6 to 8 foot across. larger than the circular light in the middle. i tried to see if i could see the object in my rear view mirror but it appeared to be gone. i did not observe any sound from the object even though it was only about 20 feet above me. i figured the time of the sighting must have been 9:59 p.m. on april 27, 2013. the sighting must have lasted about 10 seconds. also while this was going on, there were no other cars on the road and after continuing about 1\\2 mile i did see 2 different cars coming from the other direction and i flashed my lights at them just to alert them, in case the object was still in the area or if it possibly landed."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pleasant Hill","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Region":"Tennessee","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-85.181928","City":"Pleasant Hill","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47032.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47032.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/28/2013 02:40 UTC","Latitude":"35.974015","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"47032","Date of the Event":"04/27/2013 09:59 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.974015,+-85.181928(47032)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47032) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
