{"divs":["Sighting DetailsFirst noticed light when in mother-in-law's driveway. Appeared to be a light moving in a repetitious path on some kind of aircraft. The central light was yellowish, but it had a bright red cone of light around it, not unlike a laser light show. The red cone did not extend much past the yellowish light and circulated with it. It travelled east to west for a few minutes and then began to head north at which time the lights faded. I would chock it up to a helicopter with a searchlight, but is was too high up ( just under the clouds) and it's light was not circulating in a pattern consistent with a localized suspect search (we have police helicopters flying over our house all the time). I have never seen any aircraft with lights like I witnessed, nor circulating in the way that I saw, and we have many aircraft flying overhead or nearby."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"circulating, yellowish light with red cone","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"35925","Date Submitted":"02/19/2012 02:05 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 49 other sightings in Huntington Beach","There was one other sighting in Huntington Beach on or around February 18th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.707723,+-118.026096(35925)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35925) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35925.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35925.html"],"Log Number":"US-02192012-0005","Object Features":"None","City":"Huntington Beach","Longitude":"-118.026096","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.707723","Date of the Event":"02/18/2012 09:45 UTC"}
