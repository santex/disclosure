When we first spotted, the objects we thought it was a plane or helicopter...but noticed the unusual brillance in color and strange formation and close proximity of the objects to one another...that we almost new right away it was something other than a plane or helicopter...their position in the air was odd... and they had the ability to fly in different directions quickly...
