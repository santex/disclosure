Neither of us could see what what was making it. I asked my girlfriend to take some pictures with my Droid and the last couple she took without looking through the windshield. The contrail just seemed to continue straight up as we observed while driving east. After a few minutes we had to turn south and get on the freeway and by the time we were able to stop and look again it was out of sight and the contrail has dissipated. I have more pictures if it would help show the trajectory."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28691.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28691_submitter_file1__2011-04-15_09-52-30_902.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28691_submitter_file2__2011-04-15_09-53-34_927.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28691_submitter_file3__2011-04-15_09-54-06_599.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28691.html"],"trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Tempe","There were no other sightings in Tempe on or around April 15th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"04/15/2011 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00"}
