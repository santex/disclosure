Afterwards, I went home and decided to check the night sky with my night vision monocular. I could not believe my eyes how many fast, hovering, satellite like objects I noticed and filmed. Even some came very close to the downtown core of Vancouver and what seemed to be a plane, hovered, red light went to bright white light, then just red dot and travelled very slow entire city,no sound and seemed to be about 1000 Ft. I did not capture this one on video as was quite stunned. Next I captured what i thought was a satellite definately turned out to be a UFO as it travelled from West to East approx. 60 degrees above the horizon for a few seconds and then suddenly before hiding behind a building, immediately stopped and \"bounced\" back traveling opposite direction, so amazing and captured on Night vision but pixelated due to cheap DVR...I hope many other people have reported what I have seen.I could not believe the amount of UFO's,!!!! I am 110% believer now.."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"41444","Date Submitted":"08/05/2012 04:09 UTC","Summary":"Satellite like object sudden directional change opposite direction","Date of the Event":"08/05/2012 11:50 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Vancouver","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
