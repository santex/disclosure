My brother who was 9, we went outdoors with see to see what it was. It disappeared before the sun came up. It hovered over the dense woods behind our house (in the country at that time). UFO's Definitely exist! At first it appeared to be a beautiful full moon. Then as I watched, it moved upwards in the sky and then in erratic directions.... something that was very shocking. I should have woken my parents up, but didn't. My brother and I went outside to explore but weren't able to get anywhere near it."]}
