{"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","divs":["sighting detailsat 4:35am, march 30, 2008, i witnessed on my way to work just staring at the sky while travelling south bound on highway 37\\interstate 69 just north of 96th street (approx. ��� mile) in the indianapolis\\fishers (in) area an unusual light pattern. i first thought this may have been an electrical occurrence in some power lines, but realised that there are no power lines on my route. the light was a low intensity, translucent, white to very light blue in color, and oblong in shape. the size was similar to that of a beach ball, maybe a little bigger. the light rapidly moved north at my guess of 100+mph perpendicular to the outside shoulder of the northbound lanes; its altitude was approximately 30��� above the ground. i saw no object related to the light, but the light seemed to pulse\\flash at every length of its width in travel, a very rapid pulse considering the speed that i surmised. i tried to keep view of the object, but travelling at 60mph myself and crossing a lane inadvertently (then trying to regain my control of my vehicle) i lost sight of the light. this all seemed to last no more than 3-4 seconds of me witnessing it."],"Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"10105","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10105.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10105.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10105.html"],"Object Shape":"Blimp","Region":"Indiana","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.961993","Date of the Event":"03/30/2008 04:35 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.961993,+-86.005783(10105)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10105) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03302008-0011","Summary":"pulsating light in the Indianapolis, IN area","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Fishers","There were no other sightings in Fishers on or around March 30th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/30/2008 04:35 UTC","City":"Fishers","Longitude":"-86.005783","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
