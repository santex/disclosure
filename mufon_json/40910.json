{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on my lanai having coffee looking at the sky when out of nowhere seemingly saw a green glowing orb, I ran to get a closer look it went right over my house. I went inside looked out front door and window, but could not find where it went. The time was approximately between 5:30am and 6am. Frankly, I noticed because it was glowing and caught my attention with the color, never seen anything like before. I totally was in absolute awe, don't think I had a thought beyond what in the world is that. I did not know what to do afterwards, but finally decided if someone else saw I must be a witness to this. I really don't like having seen something unusual, but I can't come up with any rational answer for what it could be. I know pictures would be useful, but in a moment like that I can't think straight."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.881389,+-81.324167(40910)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40910) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Fireball","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/18/2012 09:53 UTC","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-07182012-0018","Longitude":"-81.324167","City":"De Bary","Date of the Event":"07/18/2012 05:48 UTC","Summary":"I saw a green glowing orb went right over house","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in De Bary","There were no other sightings in De Bary on or around July 18th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Case Number":"40910","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40910.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40910.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"28.881389"}
