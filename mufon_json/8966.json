Near Platteville, CO Saw one single light bright. I thought I was watching a plane with landing lights on. As it changed angle in the sky it turned from one light to 2 sets of 3 long lights on each side. Angled like wings would be. Just on the side of one light it looked grey. The lights were bright white. Direction was North when it was one single light. Started to change direction,turning toward the East than saw the 2 sets of 3 long lights. Finished turn to the South.
