I leaned over and looked out the drivers side window from the passanger side and observed an orange pulsating... kinda... light in the sky traveling from east to west. It was not going fast enough to be a plane, and it did not fly in a straight line. It bobbed across the sky before fading out, or going behind a cloud. In any case, it was gone after that. When it was gone, I said to my friend \"we just saw a ufo!\". He said \"really? you think so?\" I said \"was it an \"unidentified flying object? Yeah we just saw a ufo!\" We then drove out to the country side where the city lights aren't so bright and watched the sky for another couple hours, but didn't see anything else."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.253784,+-94.418068(29150)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29150) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Liberty","There were no other sightings in Liberty on or around May 20th 1976","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-05202011-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29150.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29150_submitter_file1__ufo2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29150.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"29150","Region":"Missouri","Date of the Event":"05/20/1976 02:12 UTC"}
