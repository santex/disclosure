{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt's happened a few times, I usually forget after it happens, kinda like a dream? I guess is the best way to describe it. But I reported to Roger Marsh that I had seen a flash of blueish greenish light in the sky. It illuminates the sky for not even a couple of seconds, it can repeat, but there is no consistency to how it occurs. The one night I reported it may have been the forth or fifth time it has happened. Now it occurs late at night, and no noise is apparent. Just a flashing light, not concentrated in one area, just seemed to brighten the whole sky. I have no idea what it was, and have even forgotten about it, but the last time i saw it, I googled it and that is my story at this time. Im in lower Bucks county PA anybody with a similar story I'd love to hear it. The feeling when it happens is that of stop, look around, the hair stands up on your arm, and again no logical explanation."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"22350","Longitude":"-75.005169","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/31/2010 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.143999,+-75.005169(22350)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22350) map </A>","Summary":"flash of greenish blueish light lasting few seconds, happens 2 to 3 times sporadically every couple months","City":"Feasterville","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date Submitted":"03/17/2010 08:40 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22350.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22350.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-03172010-0016","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Feasterville","There were no other sightings in Feasterville on or around January 31st 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.143999"}
