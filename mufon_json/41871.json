I like to look at the sky and can tell the difference between shooting stars, space junk reentering, satellites and aircraft. This was like nothing I have ever. I saw a totall of four craft on three occasions over the span of a half hour. The first was of two orange crafts flying at very high altitude at an unbelievable speed. They were heading from east to northeast and slowly split apart as the moved northward and ascended. About ten minutes later the same type of craft came by heading north but was a single object. After another ten minutes there was another one heading north as well. Observed for about another half hour until we developed a cloud cover. This is the first time I have ever seen any ufos. I wanted to try to video it but my iPhone doesn't pick up things in the night sky."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08192012-0019","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"4 objects sited over northeast Ohio last night.
