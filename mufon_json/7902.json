{"Region":"California","City":"Los Angeles","divs":["Sighting DetailsI decided to reveal my collection of photos for professionals such as your group to look at and give your oppinion on what things I should do and were my research possibly go from here. I have the ability to contact ufo's telepathicly, and also can communicate with them to some degree. I aam what you might say a true contactee. I have over 20,000 photos and some videos, and some photos of alians . If you send a investigator I can call them and he can see for him or her self, please don't think I'am dilusional or mental, If you want the real thing just give me a call and will make arrangements. Also I have lots of witnesses to my abilities. sincerly Robert Bingham"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09122007-0008","Case Number":"7902","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-118.241165","Latitude":"34.059674","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7902.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7902.html"],"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/02/2007 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"03:04:25","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were 2 other sightings in Los Angeles on or around September 2nd 2007"],"Date of the Event":"09/02/2007 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.059674,+-118.241165(7902)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7902) map </A>","Summary":"thousands of sightings to much to descibe on this short space"}
