When I got close and was passing the Nichols road exit near Lake Elsinore, CA, I looked up in the sky just a little to the left and saw a object in the sky that had lights all at the bottom. The lights were in a half circle and were going on and off left to right.I could tell the object was disc shaped and was leaning toward me, or toward the north. It was to high to be anything sitting on the hills to my left, I live in the area and it was to high and to close to the freeway.After it passed over my car I kept trying to see it in my rear view mirror but couldnt. I now wish I had pulled over and got a longer look. I know I could not of been the only person to see this thing, there was a decent amount of traffic going both directions.y first thought was a blimp but the lights were not on the side, did any one else report this?"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.670777","Date of the Event":"12/05/2009 11:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-12112009-0005","Summary":"Semi Circle lights on bottom half going on and off left to right","Date Submitted":"12/11/2009 02:17 UTC","City":"Lake Elsinore","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lake Elsinore","There were no other sightings in Lake Elsinore on or around December 5th 2009"],"Region":"California","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.321262","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
