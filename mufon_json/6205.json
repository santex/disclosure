He rented a small plane to accrue hours toward his license. He asked another friend (or hired him, I���m not sure) to serve as a copilot and make a short round trip from the Olive Branch airport to another in Mississippi. I was traveling in rear seat of the plane video recording the flight since this was my first flight of this nature, when on our way back from Mississippi we encounter this light on the sky. Nor the pilot or the copilot witnessed it. While enjoying the view from the plane, I noticed a light on the left side of the plane. At the beginning I thought that it was the sun reflecting on the Pyramid (Sports and events arena in Memphis) but we were not even close to its location and it was not in that direction. Then I noticed that the light was located a little higher than the horizon. This indicated me that it was on the sky in an altitude greater than our plane. I had the perception that the light was just floating either without moving at all or moving very slowly. Unfortunately due to the high vibration of the airplane it was almost impossible to make a zoom of the object, but I tried. I was a little puzzled by the sight since I didn't know what to make out of the object, but I was positive that it was nothing that I know. I wanted to make the pilot and the copilot aware of the object, but I didn���t have a headset and the noise was too loud to speak; besides since they were talking about the flight I thought it was not safe to distract them. After a few minutes the object just disappear fading out into the sky. I'm submitting the video I capture. Although I���m just submitting the part where the object appears, I have the entire recording of the flight which last 1 hour approximately."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6205.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6205.html"],"Longitude":"-90.03904","Date of the Event":"06/05/2004 12:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-01212007-0004","Summary":"Flying on a small airplane I enounter a lught on the sky","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Tennessee","Country":"United States","Latitude":"35.157534","Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Memphis","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON"}
