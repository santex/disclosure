Taking pictures of cloud formations when I noticed a commercial jet flying overhead. I don,t remember seeing the UFO at the time I took the picture, I was just wanting to test the camera's ability to capture an immage I knew was at least 10,000-20,000 feet away. None of the other pictures that were taken that day had any defect or oddities. I would appreciate your oppinion on the immage. At normal zoom the UFO looks like a classic cigar shape, but when I zoom in it appears to be 3 uniform points of light in a straght line. The other odd thing is that it seems to be at or near the same altitude as the jet and appears to be stationary at the time of the photograph. I have included 2 of the other pictures I took that day which do not show anything unusual. Thank you for your time."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Object Shape":"Cigar","Log Number":"US-03212009-0002","Date of the Event":"04/01/2007 06:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Morgantown","There were no other sightings in Morgantown on or around April 1st 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","City":"Morgantown"}
