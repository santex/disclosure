night panned out. i'm one that does not believe in the supernatural, but there is no refuting what i saw tonight. i was doing a research paper for my friend who needed me to help him with his school work. i walked outside to take a smoke break and looked into the sky and saw a blinking star of various colors in sky. first, i thought it was probably a plane or a helicopter or something, but then it moved swiftly to the left, then to the right, then up. by this point, i thought i was just seeing things because i had been in front of the computer screen for much to long so i looked at the other stars and planes in the sky to see if it was just my vision, but none of the stars were as brilliant or changing colors and blinking like this star. so i went back in the house to grab my phone to call my sister to tell her what i had seen and then proceeded to go back outside to see if it was sttill there. sure enough, it was, but it remained still for a long time. i turned around trying to take my mind off of it and saw another bright star, more brilliant than the star that i had been examining for the past few minutes, and it too blinked several colors. i started screaming on the phone telling my sister that i had saw another when suddenly the more brilliant star moved swiftly to the left, then hovered for moments, and moved up. it was the wierdest thing, but i would have been content with never sharing that story with anyone other than my sister, it wasn't too spectacular, and i figured i was maybe just having an overactive imagination. then i looked back at the first star again and saw a bright light coming towards my direction through the trees in my neighbor's backyard. it had to be about 300 or so feet in the air, but it was a massive light and there were red lights and green lights on it as well. as it drew closer, i saw its silhouette in the night sky, and it looked to be a giant disk. it flew slowly and glided through the air. it made absolutely no sound, which was wierd considering that it had now come very close to where i was--it had to be about 100 feet or so away from me. my knees got weak and i became speechless on the phone with my sister who was trying to get me to talk about what was happening. it was massive, and the shear size of it scared the [cms\\tg\\pd] out of me. suddenly my sister stopped talking on the phone, so i said hello and all i could hear was feedback of myself talking. i kept talking, saying hello, to try to get my sister to answer. but nothing, all i could hear was my own voice coming back to me. i ran into the house, looking for some type of camera and grabbed my father's digital point and shoot hoping that i could catch it on video somehow. however, when i looked into the sky, it seemed to have shot off into the distance because now it was much closer to the brighter of the two blinking stars in the sky. it flew into that star and never came out. i know what i saw, it was no helicopter, especially considering that for whatever reason, there had been a sequence of police helicopters with spotlights surveying the area for the duration of the night at low altitudes. they were very loud and small when compared to the silent and large disk i had seen. i had always been a skeptic before, but i cant refute what i had just seen. it was the most amazing and eery of things. part of me would like to see it again so that i can tape it, but the other part of me would rather be completely oblivious to it all. i knew it was crazy, so i wanted to see if there was anyone else online that had possibly seen what i had. i googled, \"ufo sightings in maryland november 6, 2009\" and of course nothing came up, but this site was the first on the list. so, i've decided to post this story hoping that maybe there was someone else in the area that may have seen it, or have photos, or something to give me maybe a piece of my sanity back. i do want to set a disclaimer that your systems wouldnt let me set midnight as the time i saw it, so i set it as 1am. however, the sighting happened around 12:08 am."],"Summary":"a disc like craft that made no sound flew in very close proximity to me.","Object
