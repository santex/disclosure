One of the lights disappeared. When I met up with my friends about half an hour later, we saw it again. We followed it and my friend got some of it on video using her iPod (she was in a car so the footage is kind of shaky). As we were following it, it seemed to turn on it's side and did a 180. One of the lights started blinking frantically We lost it and then went over to an elementary school to see if it would come back. We saw it again but it was farther away and not moving. A few minutes later we saw a helicopter circling the area where we had seen the UFO."],"Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Date Submitted":"01/08/2012 03:47 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34716.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34716.html"],"Longitude":"-83.195145","Country":"United States","Summary":"2 bright lights right next to eachother, hovered then zoomed away","Case Number":"34716","City":"Rochester Hills"}
