As we were standing there noticed a bright light moving across the sky. Thought it was a satellite at first. As we wathed it moved in an irregular manner, side to side, fast and slow. It stopped and remained motionless for a few seconds and then would continue on. We began to watch closely as it continued to do this a few more times. It then stopped for a longer period of time and then circled back towards us and appeared to be now moving to us. We became anxious and uneasy as it moved closer and got in the vehicle and drove away. This is a remote strech of highway along the edge of the boreal forest with many small communities along the way."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Strange moving light that circled backwards when noticed.","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"07/29/2010 11:00 UTC","Region":"Saskatchewan","Date Submitted":"07/31/2010 09:52 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.211159,+-105.74958(24858)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24858) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Prince Albert","There were no other sightings in Prince Albert on or around July 29th 2010"],"Country":"Canada","Object Shape":"Circle"}
