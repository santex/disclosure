I could see the outline of the craft even though it was dark outside. I got my camera & keys & headed to the car to follow it & take a picture but in the few seconds it took to get outside, it was gone. Shortly after that I heard the sound of jet engines , like military planes use."],"Object Shape":"Triangle"}
