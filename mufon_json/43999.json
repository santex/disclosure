When above the freeway over between the Tacoma Dome and McKinley Park area there was an object that had made this sharp turn that looked like an equilateral triangle with 3 orange lights at each tip and another red glowing light on the center. what caught my eye was the sharp turn that it made showing the four lights on the bottom of the craft. I told my Mom about the craft and she told me it was probably the Stealth flying low, as I had told my Mom that I had seen that flying over by McChord Air Force Base years ago. I explained to her that the this was much bigger than the Stealth and that the shape was wrong and that when I had seen it at night it was per the News Tribune a test flight to see how the plane would react to our rainy weather up here in Tacoma VS California. Of note the I-5 Highway was damp on the road where the cars didn't drive due to rain earlier that evening. I slowed down on the freeway and continued to watch the object as I got closer to the McKinley Park and Tacoma Dome area the object floated over the McKinley Park Hill, and disappeared over the hill. I thought once I got around the curve to the exit for highway 16 I could see if the flight path was over the freeway going into Joint Base Lewis McChord, the normal flight path for the cargo and jet planes that fly into the base. In the 3 mins it took to get to the exit there was nothing. No planes in the air, nothing. I ended my call to my Mom when I got home a few mins later. That weekend I asked our MUFON State Director about what color the lights are on a normal aircraft and he told me. Since then I have been trying to locate any aircraft with lights like that and I cannot find any"],"Longitude":"-122.437961","Region":"Washington","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.256077,+-122.437961(43999)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43999) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43999.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43999.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/01/2012 08:50 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"47.256077","City":"Tacoma","Summary":"Triangle object with 1 red & 3 orange lights","Date Submitted":"11/18/2012 01:37 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"43999"}
