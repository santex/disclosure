The light was steady, and it did not glow beyond the sharp borders of the shape. The triangle was facing point side towards the earth. It was at least twice as high as the pine trees. It was if you had an orange sheet of paper and laid a black sheet of paper with a triangle cut out on top of it. We decided to try and find the source, but once we lost sight of it, it disappeared. It was like nothing either of us had ever seen before or since. And also very unlike any other UFO sightings we've heard of. There is no industry in the area--it's a rural farming community. Where we approximate the origination to be would be either pine forest or crop field."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45447.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45447.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Case Number":"45447","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-01282013-0004","Date of the Event":"10/10/2004 10:28 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.999888,+-79.199487(45447)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45447) map </A>","Longitude":"-79.199487","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","City":"Aynor","Date Submitted":"01/28/2013 08:53 UTC","Latitude":"33.999888"}
