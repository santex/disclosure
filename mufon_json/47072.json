I leaned back and looked out the window at the stars. One star I noticed seemed to be pulsing more than any of the others. Given that I started seeing some red and green colors I thought it was a plane. However I looked at it for 2 minutes and it did not move what-so-ever. The orb was completely stationary, however the light revolved around itself and changed colors in a quick and fluid way. A cloud bank moved in and covered up the object after a few minutes and I lost sight of it."],"Date of the Event":"04/29/2013 08:25 UTC","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Boston","There were no other sightings in Boston on or around April 29th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.34635","Region":"Massachusetts","Longitude":"-71.162676","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
