This time the star like object came from due north of my house and headed Southeast. Again it looked like a star and even crossed over a couple of stars, but was definitly below them in altitude. It did not flash like an aircraft and was moving at too slow of a speed to be a meteor. It did disappear near Saggitarius again. My wife saw it as well, but neither of us know what it was. The object did not travel a straight line the entire time we saw it. It did move in a slight zig-zag motion shortly before it disappeared."]}
