38,000 foot flight level at a 45��� elevation. these estimates are highly questionable due to the altitude and short duration of observation. my best guess as to what the object could have been, is that it could be one of many rockets or boosters that are in a decaying orbit overhead. i am not certain if it is possible to actually see shape in these objects as they travel through the daytime sky ? an online attempt was made to determine if there were any of these rockets \\ boosters in orbit at the time in question, however there are so many objects that it appeared to be a futile attempt. observation #3 13:35 again, directly overhead, an unaided observation of a flash or reflection was seen. i immediately, brought my binoculars up and into focus. the object was traveling in a south - north direction. it seemed to have form of a typical plane or a 'plus'(+)shape. it seemed to have form on the ends of the + shape. it was far too high to be able to maintain a steady view through the binoculars. the object was not highly-reflective as it traveled. it did not spin or rotate. i was able to watch the object from it's position overhead for approximately 10 seconds. during this period, the object traveled about 30 inches (arms length) until it traveled behind a tree about 200 feet from my position. i lost sight at an elevation of about 35-45���s. in comparison, a high flight-level plane at an elevation of about 60 degrees to my north, travels about eight inches (arms length) in a period of 35 - 40 seconds. at this distance and altitude, the shape of the plane is quite discernible and not in question! this object was high and traveling very fast. after contemplating this object for some time, it suddenly occurred to me that it was probably the iss. a quick check determined that the iss was traveling at this time over southern south america. i have no solid idea what this object was. again, i'm not certain of the ability to see form in objects that are in low earth orbit during the daytime. observation #4 16:00 i noticed a bright point of light in the south eastern sky at about a 45 degree elevation. raising my binoculars, the object appeared to resemble a planet as viewed during the daytime with binoculars. there was some form to the object and it resembled a large balloon. it appeared that there was some sort of appendage on the lower side \\ bottom of the object. due to my movement however, this is uncertain. there was a gradual movement that seemed to be toward the nne. travel was about three inches (at arms length) in a period of about four-six minutes. after this movement, the object began a gradual movement in a ese direction. object was in view for approximately an additional 15-20 minutes until it reduced to a very fine point of light and i was unable to relocate the object after taking a 'movement break' for a few seconds. at this point, depending upon actual altitude,the object would most likely have been over western central nj. although interesting, i assumed that due to the duration, altitude and travel of the object, that it was most likely a weather balloon. i had never seen one. national weather service(nws)indicates that weather balloon flights are able to last in excess of two hours and travel about 125 miles. altitudes attained can reach 115,000 feet. balloon releases are normally scheduled at 00:00 and 12:00 utc with exceptions for additional releases for specific storm concerns. the diameter of the balloon at it's bursting point can be as wide as 20 feet. as a footnote to these events, at 17:15, i saw a bright lime-green balloon with a curly tail rise above the treetop about 200 feet from my location. it began it's northward travel and i watched with and without binoculars for about 12 minutes until it became non-viewable. this added some perspective to the preceding events of the day. again, after spending the amount of time i have this past summer watching planes, i find it improbable to have witnessed these four objects in a single day. it did none the less, happen."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/24/2007 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8541.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8541.html"],"Case Number":"8541","Latitude":"40.138611","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"Four + hours of observation, four individual observations of short duration.
