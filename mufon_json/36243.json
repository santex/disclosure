Location: central VA. I didn't report them at first because I wasn't sure how to describe them, but today I saw the video, \"Most Groundbreaking UFOs of February 2012\" online and saw the exact same thing as the video, \"strobe lights over Australia.\" There was one very bright light. I am an amateur astronomer, so I will describe the light as brighter than Venus when at its brightest (the only known sky object brighter than Venus is the moon). It was south-southwest in the sky and stationary. As I stared at it, two very bright lights suddenly flashed a bit to the right of the stationary one. The flashes were very bright and very quick, almost like a camera flash. They flashed, then invisible, flashed again, then all 3 disappeared completely. They didn't move off, they just vanished."],"Date Submitted":"03/04/2012 01:41 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Objects flashed very brightly a couple of times and then disappeared","Log Number":"US-03042012-0010","City":"Scottsville","Longitude":"-78.536589","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"02/27/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36243.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36243.html"]}
