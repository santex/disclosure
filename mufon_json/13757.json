The first thing that drew my attention to the craft was the hum of its engine. It was a kind of hum-flutter sound. I have military, law enforcement, and some flight training, so I was more interested in trying to figure out what kind of craft it was when I first looked up and saw almost directly over me.. The aircraft was more or less in a kind of very slow moving hover mode. The trees where I ride my bike are maybe 50 to 70 feet tall, the craft was maybe another 100 feet or so above the trees. I���m not too good at estimating distances, but to me it was like looking at school buss maybe two blocks or so away. The sky was very clear that night, and filled with visible stars, so the craft was very easy to see. I was directly under it traveling very slowly north on my bike, and the craft was traveling very slowly south (barely moving). The craft was triangular in shape, and had alternating red and white flashing lights all around it. They were evenly spaced about a foot or so apart on all three sides. The nose of the craft had a dished out area that contained a high beam light. I could see the beam reached out into the sky until it faded out. The light seemed to have the ability to turn as if it was searching the sky. The body of the craft was for the most part just a dark colored area surrounded by the flashing lights. I really couldn���t make out any specific details. While I looked up at the craft I first thought it must be some kind of new helicopter (because it was so low and so slow moving, and almost familiar flutter sound of the engine), but it was not shaped like any helicopter I had ever seen before, or like any other aircraft I had ever seen before. I took my eyes off of the craft for maybe a second or two to turn my bike around from going north to going south, and that fast the craft was gone. It was a completely clear night, I could see the stars in all directions, and there was not a single aircraft in the sky. At that moment I was convinced that what I had seen was no ordinary aircraft. Again, it was like looking at a school bus sitting in an open field maybe 200 feet away, then while blinking your eyes it is completely gone. I rode my bike around for a while to see if I could spot it again, but no luck. When I got home I called the local Police Department to inquire if anyone had called in to report seeing anything unusual in the sky. They said no, and asked why. I told them what I had seen and the lady I talked to sounded interested, but I���m sure she probably thought I was a nut���I felt like one just telling her the story. I also tried to call the local airport control tower, but got a recording that they closed at 9 pm. The next morning I called the airport control tower again, and was put in contact with the lady who was on duty that night. I told her my story, and asked if she knew of any aircraft that might come close to that description that would fly in our general area? She advised me that there were a few craft in the sky before 9 pm, but nothing at all after 9 pm, and nothing at all at any time traveling north to south. She seemed interested, so we chatted about it for a few minutes. She mentioned that the nearby air base had a lot of traffic going in and out of it, but I���m not sure what ���nearby��� air force base she is talking about? On the evening of the event I typed everything about the incident into my computer, plus date and time. I subsequently deleted the story, and was sorry that I did a few weeks later. Now I am not absolutely sure of the exact day or date."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Modesto","There was one other sighting in Modesto on or around September 4th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"09/04/2008 09:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13757.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13757.html"],"Latitude":"37.643587","Sighting Duration":"00:01:15","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Other","Case Number":"13757"}
