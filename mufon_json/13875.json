{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsthis is a report from nearly 40 years ago, so i am not sure of the exact date & time, only the year and season. you might note, that i have reported 1 previous sighting, which took place in 1981 and 2 recent sightings, one of them viewed by my husband. i have several past sightings, starting from 1969 to present. i have one very recent sighting to report, which i will post later, as it occurred in a different location and time period. this sighting took place near wichita falls, tx, which is home to shepperd air force base. date was sometime in the first months of 1969. i was with my boyfriend, the time was about an hour or so, after sunset. it was fairly cold, totally clear weather. we were just out and about, cruising around in the countryside. quite suddenly, tom stopped the car and said, \"did you see that?\" i had. it was a bright, star-like object, which had streaked across the sky from the w\\sw to e\\se, in a flat trajectory. the flight was much like an f16, only a whole lot faster. as we watched the night sky, we were situated to the north, looking south. the object had come to a near stop in the e\\se portion of the sky. it suddenly made a 90 degree turn to the south, then another 90 degree to the west and shot back across the sky from whence it came, disappearing in the distance. this happened all in a matter of about 5 seconds. then as tom and i continued to watch the sky in awe and silence, 4 more objects appeared in the w\\sw, from the horizon. they streaked across the sky together and stopped just to the e\\se of us, almost exactly where the first object had stopped. from our vantage point, approx. 70 degrees above the se horizon and almost exactly where the first object had stopped. they made several zigzag movements, all 90 degree angle turns, then the objects proceeded to the east at tremendous speed, disappearing in the far distance. i might add that the terrain around wichita falls is fairly flat and at that time, the area we were in was all farm and ranch land. we both had a clear view of the entire sky. i recall no other aircraft in the sky. both sightings lasted a totally of possibly 15 seconds. tom and i sat there in complete silence for several minutes. we then looked at each other and began asking out loud, \"what the heck was that?\" we both agreed that neither of us could identify these bright objects, so they must have been \"ufos\". we were not scared at the time, only baffled and curious to try to understand what we had witnessed. later that evening i told my mother about the incident. she just nodded and said, \"exciting, isn't it?\" evidently my mother had witnessed such things before and had never talked about it. i can understand that. when i mention i have see something odd in the sky, most people roll their eyes and look at me like i've lost my mind. however, there has been exceptions and a few have told me they witnessed similar sights. also, i would like to mention that the last time i spoke to tom was over 20 years ago. i do not know where he is, or how to contact him but maybe he too, remembers that night. end report."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-98.488247","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Wichita Falls","There were no other sightings in Wichita Falls on or around February 1st 1969"],"Latitude":"33.923498","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.923498,+-98.488247(13875)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13875) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13875.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13875.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"One then four star-like objects moving at incredible speed and making impossible turns.","Log Number":"US-11212008-0014","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"13875","Date of the Event":"02/01/1969 07:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"02/01/1969 07:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Wichita Falls"}
