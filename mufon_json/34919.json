That is when we saw an object in the sky and it was lower than the rim of the hills behind it so we stopped the car and rolled down the window and told the kids to take a good look at the ufo because we probably will never see another one. We ( my husband and I)mentaly shook our heads and drove on home. The object was very dim because of the time but still very clearly seen .It appeared to have light coming from the evenly spaced \" WINDOWS\" around it. When we got home we debated on calling the radio about it but didn't want to be put on the nut list.. We heard the next morning that 40 people had called in and saw what we had. Then in 1992 I had a very weird experence on Whidby Island, Washington that I won't go into now. Very scary."],"Object Features":"Window(s)","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Ukiah","There were no other sightings in Ukiah on or around April 27th 1954"],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Ukiah","Date Submitted":"01/17/2012 09:03 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"family coming home from church saw it , stopped the car rolled down windows and stared at it .Told kids to take a good look"}
