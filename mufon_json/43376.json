{"Date of the Event":"10/17/2012 11:51 UTC","divs":["sighting detailson wednesday october 17, 2012 at 11:51pm est, my wife, son and i witnessed 2 separate fiery red balls of light pass through the night sky. the second of which i caught on my iphone video camera. the sky was absolutely clear and there were many stars visible. at first, we thought it was an airplane on fire but, there was no sound whatsoever. and, no headlights or flashing lights. unlike a \"shooting star\" \\ meteor, the balls of light travelled across the sky and not straight down towards the earth! the \"balls of light\" travelled in a straight line across the sky at approximately 25��� ne heading nw. we only caught the first \"ball of light\" for several seconds. the second one appeared immediately after the first in the same general vicinity and lasted for almost a full minute before it faded away. the color of the \"balls of light\" were white, yellow and red. the front or \"head\" of the \"balls of light\" were a bright white with trailing reds and yellow. the shape was somewhat round and coned at times like that of a meteor travelling at a high velocity. the size was fairly large but, hard to put into perspective since it was difficult to determine how far away the objects were. like i said, i took this video on my iphone and the quality is bogus. i then brought the clip into adobe premiere so i could \"zoom in\" on the object as far as i could while keeping it in frame. it was impossible to keep my phone steady while still trying to watch the object at the same time so that's why the object is bouncing around. sorry no tri-pod. :("],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.02873","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.63989,+-79.02873(43376)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43376) map </A>","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Myrtle Beach","There were no other sightings in Myrtle Beach on or around October 17th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Region":"South Carolina","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10192012-0005","Object Shape":"Cone, Fireball, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/19/2012 09:40 UTC","Summary":"2 separate white, red, and yellow fire balls in the sky.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"43376","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"33.63989","Tags":"City","City":"Myrtle Beach","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43376.html"]}
