{"divs":["Sighting Details( 1st ) I only want to report this to see if anyone else seen the same thing....At work, I walked out to check the weather at 4:10 A.M. it was a clear sky. I looked up and noticed a dull circular light traveling in a North westernly direction, light object traversed in a strait line with no blinking lights and no sound. From the moment it was over head until the time it traveled the whole distance of the sky was about 4 seconds. It was much faster than a satellite and to dull to be a meteor. I thought it could be a satellite at first but the object was larger than that but smaller than a low flying aircraft and it was definately the fastest moving object I have ever seen."],"Case Number":"28214","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03122011-0011","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"dull white light traveling the whole distance of the sky in about 4 seconds object appeared to be a disc in shape","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"04:10:00","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Mansfield","There were no other sightings in Mansfield on or around March 12th 2011"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-82.506247","City":"Mansfield","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28214.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28214.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/12/2011 06:39 UTC","Latitude":"40.76462","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.76462,+-82.506247(28214)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28214) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/12/2011 12:00 UTC"}
