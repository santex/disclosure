Flashed multiple colors, red, green, blue, red and orange. Still possible I was observing a star or planet though no other planet or star I've ever observed behaved in the same way. What stood out from other objects in sky was pulsating nature and color variation. After observing for 20 minutes I went inside. I came out of my house about 40 minutes after last observation to check on object but was gone. Periodically checked for object over the next few hours but it never returned. Object never moved while being observed."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.719823,+-73.998313(41748)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41748) map </A>","Longitude":"-73.998313","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Stationary pulsating orb observed for 20 minutes.
