When I got there. I got my sewer snake and went under the trailer to see if I could fixed the stopped up pipe. After I came out from under the trailer. I was walking to my truck to put my sewer snake in the back of my truck. then I stopped before I got to my truck. I notice a strange object moving slow . it was moving less then 5 miles per hour. it was about 15 feet off of the ground . it was about 3 feet long. on each end it was blue. in the middle it was lit up with a bunch of small lights and it was glowing. I was standing about thirty feet away from the object. I could not believe what I was seeing. Then the object flew about fifty feet. Then it started to fall apart into light particles. the object started to fall apart from the front until it vanish. it was like fireworks falling without any sound. This happened around 8 PM on Tuesday 2006 I just thought I would share this sighting you can believe me or not, its up to you"]}
