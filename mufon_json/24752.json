It was either reflecting the sunlight and glimmering as it rotated or it was emitting its own light. I looked through my sonn's hunting scope and observed the object rotating but could not make out a definite shape. At one point the object stopped for several minutes and then proceeded for a few seconds and disappeared. I called my family and a friend up to my balcony and they also witnessed the object. It has the same characteristics as the last objects we observed from the prior week. No,I do not have psychic abilities like some of the nuts that witness \"their sightings\" and report it on this site. I am not an unbalanced UFO nut. I know that this thing has no characteristics of any aircraft I have seen and it isn't a balloon of any kind. Maybe this is military craft? It is just plain weird what we have witnessed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24752.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24752.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/25/2010 09:51 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.141059,+-117.218883(24752)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24752) map </A>","Summary":"Observed object traveling from west to east on same horizontal plane as I witnessed last week.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"San Marcos","Case Number":"24752","Log Number":"US-07252010-0008","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"07/25/2010 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Longitude":"-117.218883","Latitude":"33.141059"}
