It was like a check mark if you will. It was so fast I barely saw it. I didnt say anything to my wife as I thought she would say I was crazy. But, She said to me... \"Did you see that light?\" I was like you saw it too?! So, we both saw a flash of light like a streak go down and then shoot up to into the sky. It was like a shooting star, but going up instead of down. It just vanishedd! I actually told my wife that were were going to see if we can find it again, she was oddly ok with the idea. We drove all around the area where the light was over and we saw nothing. I still wonder what it was we saw to this day......"],"Case Number":"22568","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.927044","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Franklin","There were no other sightings in Franklin on or around November 30th 2003"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/30/2010 04:27 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.927044,+-86.85906(22568)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22568) map </A>","Summary":"A Shooting Star going Up not Down","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
