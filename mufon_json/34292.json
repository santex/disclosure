I thought it was a plane as we were 5 miles from the airport. It looked unusual to me because the lights were not flashing, it was too low in the sky and made an unusual tight turn. As I watched it came to a stop and just hovered in place. We were driving and unable to stop immediatly to watch it on a very busy road. We turned around the car arround and the object was gone. Hoping that someone else saw this."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.317334,+-85.598564(34292)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34292) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/24/2011 08:28 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/25/2011 10:46 UTC","Longitude":"-85.598564","Summary":"Driving down Telegraph large triangular object starting to circle and then hover in one place.
