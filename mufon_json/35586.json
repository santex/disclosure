This happened on 09-29-11 at around 3:00 am. While getting into my car I noticed out of the corner of my left eye a very bright glowing object coming from the east at about 500 to 700 feet in the air. It moved very slow in a direct line and pulsated making no sound. It flew right directly above me and moved westward just south of the Dayton international airport near where I work. I watched it start to shoot up at about a 45 degree angle and slowly dissipeared out of site. I took a picture of it when it moved over above my head but the cell phone picture didn't come out very good and the object looked S shped in the pic. Never seen anything like it and consider my self lucky to see something unexplainable and I,ll never forget it as long as I live."],"Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.890626","Source":"MUFON"}
