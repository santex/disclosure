I video'd the event, and made a dvd for the field investigator that visited my house to conduct an interview. The Orange light appeared behind the fireworks and proceeded to pass over the car. I did have it on video. The second time, the orb came over and my attention was drawn to it by a 4th witness, passing the car. I proceeded to get out of the car, and used my phone's camera to record the object until it left view. I perceived it to be a light the could be flaming."],"Region":"Indiana"}
