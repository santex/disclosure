Looking up about 45%, I noticed a commercial airliner at about 20,000 ft. with a long contrail. While seeing this, my eye was caught by a really bright oval also flying south, as bright as the high wispy clouds, going pretty much even with the ground. If I held out my hand & measured with my fingers, as long as my pinky is wide. It appeared to be flying just below the clouds, faster than the jet. I tried hard to make out a tail or wings (no contrail behind it) but it's edges were too fuzzy. If I could identify a commercial passenger jet flying at 20k, why couldn't I identify an aircraft flying lower & closer? I pointed it out to my son when he got back in the car; he squinted at it & said it was just a plane. I let it go & forgot about it until I saw the report & pics from near Portland Airport which is about 15-20 miles north of here. Same shape but bright white."],"Case Number":"17218"}
