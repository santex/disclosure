I went over to him and he pointed at through the window and to make sure the glass was not dirty. A group of about 12 of us when on the patio on the second floor and studied it. It was white as cloud but a cylinder shape and white, also is a little bright. It definitely was not a cloud. A few attempted to take a picture but it looks really small. I have it on my camera phone and I will try to blow it up and send it along. It is now 1:47 pm and the object still has not moved. Im pretty excited. I have saw a ufo when I was a kid and this thing gave me the same reaction. I thought it might have been a balloon but it seemed to large to be one. Its just stationary. The direction seems to be over Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A north east direction."],"Longitude":"-118.164139"}
