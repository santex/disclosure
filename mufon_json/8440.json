After locating it with the telescope I was astonished to see it was actually a cluster of lights. It then started moving west to east and I was able to track it thru the scope for about 2 minutes til it faded away in the eastern horizon. This was also witnessed by my wife and daughter who also described it as 6 or 7 brighter lites on the leading edge in the shape of a boomerang, followed by about a dozen dimmer lites close behind which were clustered together. It was traveling much faster than any of the airliners which fly overhead, and seemed to be more distant and outside of our atmosphere. I've been looking for reports and wonder if anyone else may have seen this."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Star-like","Date of the Event":"11/12/2007 10:30 UTC","Longitude":"-114.289118","Latitude":"34.150016","Date Submitted":"11/12/2007 10:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8440.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8440.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Parker","There were no other sightings in Parker on or around November 12th 2007"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
