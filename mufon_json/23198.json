While driving down Latta Rd. we both noticed two bright amber lights in the night sky. The lights appeared to be around 4-5 blocks in distance from each other. The lights moved in unision as if they were attached beneath an object. My husband stopped the car and we both stepped out to get a better look. The object and the lights continued to glide northward in the sky. The object seemed to be about 300 ft. from the ground and floated noiselessly. The space behind the object was dark and you could not see the night sky behind it. Another car came up behind us so we jumped back in the car and turned back to follow the object but soon lost sight of it. The object did not bear usual markings of explained aircraft."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Amber Lights in night sky over Austin, Texas","Longitude":"-97.733191"}
