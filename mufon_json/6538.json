I looked up at the sky as there were many Chem-Trails which I love to try and figure what aircraft made them, at one point as I was looking up, I saw a black triangle shaped craft doing maneuvers like an old bi-plane except it was up so high it could not have been a bi-plane. The maneuvers the craft was doing was just unbelievable. All of a sudden, a second craft (same shape) went next to the other object and started doing the same types of maneuvers, again the maneuvers were awesome and so unbelievable, there is no way conventional aircraft were involved. The first object that I had witnessed took off to the South East at an incredible rate of speed. Then the second object followed the other one again at a very high rate of speed. I do not know what I saw, but I can say, that there is no way these were conventional aircraft, if they were from the military, they must be very highly classified aircraft. I leave it up to you to decide what these objects are, I truly can���t say what they were. Any questions, just send me a message. Thank you for taking time to read my experience. I have no pictures or video, this is just what I saw."],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"I saw two objects doing maneuvers that were unbelievable not regular aircraft","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6538.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6538.html"],"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Glendale","There were no other sightings in Glendale on or around March 8th 2007"]}
