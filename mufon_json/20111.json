I looked up and saw a jagged chevron in the sky with a small craft following close behind. I almost hit the van in front of me because I was so suprised. I saw multiple flashing colors and heard no sound. I am 42 years old and my son is 10 years old. We both saw exactly the same thing. It moved in a sideways motion as if it was gliding through the sky at a super slow speed. It was about 200 to 300 feet off of the ground."],"Region":"Kansas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.953617,+-94.733571(20111)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20111) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
