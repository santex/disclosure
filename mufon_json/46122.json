It was cloudy out and I remember just seeing a black triangle against the clouds with a white light at each corner. The lights were reflecting off the clouds and it didn't look like anything I had ever seen before. It was traveling pretty slowly, probably 200 feet off the ground. We realized that it could possibly be a UFO so my friend told me to run inside and get a camera. We were so excited that we all ran inside and came out maybe 10 seconds later and it was gone."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03102013-0018","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"46122","Date Submitted":"03/10/2013 10:48 UTC"}
