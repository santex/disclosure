I stopped to watch it, and listen for plane engine. it got to the point of being in front of me at about 100-150 feet and the light did not break off me like a plane beam would at a certain point. and heard no noise at all. watched the object go past my location and the light beam was just as strong as I first saw it. No noise. It went up the river and I watched it until it was out of sight. I went thru a list in my head trying to check off what it could be. The only rational explanation I could come up with was a Mylar balloon with continual light reflecting off it . It was traveling at about 35-40 miles an hour. I looked around and noticed that the wind was blowing at about 15 miles an hour against the objects direction. I have no idea what it was at this point. A little weird. Thought I would let you know. You track these things I believe."]}
