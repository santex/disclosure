Never noticed anything unusual. When looking at the photos I noticed a speck in the upper right corner of one of the pictures. I thought it was an Eagle or a Hawk so I zoomed in on it a what I saw was a metallic looking disc shaped object and not a bird. You can see the sun glisten from the object and what appears to be a slight vapor trail emitting from what looks like a hot spot under the object. The photos were shot in RAW format so no enhancements were made. What you see is what you get. I did have an encounter with a UFO in 1977 in Puyallup, Washington but no photos from that one."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.730958,+-120.699516(21580)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21580) map </A>","Log Number":"US-01212010-0012","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Washington","Summary":"From a picture taken near Mt.
