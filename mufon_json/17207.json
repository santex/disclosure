{"Latitude":"33.453477","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw a white object that might have been a star in pure daylight. Object might have been a very high altitude balloon but without the tear-drop shape. Stationary. No movement at all. (Could be a very bright star?) It's still there as I write this--about a third from the zenith facing west. I was watering the lawn and happened to look up (at about 8:45 a.m. Thursday morning). The sky was clear, no clouds. I saw a white object (not really shining at all) and it was just hanging there. About a week ago a NASA balloon passed over the region and I thought it was one of those again, but this was without the tear-drop shape--thus I wasn't all that excited. But through the binoculars it didn't reveal much more of a shape than a round object. It's still there as I write this."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.453477,+-112.069777(17207)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17207) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 2 other sightings in Phoenix on or around May 28th 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17207.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17207.html"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"17207","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"White round object (balloon?) over Phoenix very high.","Longitude":"-112.069777","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Phoenix","Log Number":"US-05282009-0010","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arizona","Object Shape":"Egg","Date of the Event":"05/28/2009 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/28/2009 12:00 UTC"}
