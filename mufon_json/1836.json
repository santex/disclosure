I first spotted it in the sky and mentioned it to everybody. Atfirst we thought it was a satellite or plane or something. But(this is when wegot the chills) the object(a rapidly flashing ball of yellow orange light)started changing speed and course! It spun around, moved in directions noplane,bird,weather balloon could ever have done. The grand finale was it shotdown, then moved to the right(in the shape of an L),shot back in the oppositedirection, and just blinked out.I will never forget that night."],"Date of the Event":"11/30/1998 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=20.856944,+-156.313056(1836)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1836) map </A>","City":"Makawao","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Log Number":"","Latitude":"20.856944","Region":"Hawaii","Object Features":"Other","Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
