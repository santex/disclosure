I looked west and saw a plane-like vehicle. The lights were similar to a plane but it was flying almost straight down and then it made a sharp turn. It was east from where I was but it was to far to see exactly what it was. I was terrified in a way because I believed it was going to crash. Like I claim I really believe it was a plane it still boggles me. It may have been a malfunction. I lost sight of the object when it flew behind view of the trees."]}
