When there was a big flash and what we thought looked like a huge fire work. The red balls were falling, then the red balls started the flying off in different directions,(more like zip off), there were a lot of them. Then there were 3 bigger lights that were moving together in a triangle formation, moving from east to west. The other objects were much smaller with flashing red lights ziping all over the sky and up to the triangle formation. This went on for a very long time."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.979714,+-105.357494(23727)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23727) map </A>","Longitude":"-105.357494","City":"Lake George","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"23727","Summary":"We were up in Eleven Mile Canyon, Lake George, CO.","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Lake George","There were no other sightings in Lake George on or around June 4th 2010"],"Region":"Colorado","Object Shape":"Fireball","Disposition":"Unknown"}
