An extremely bright \"firework\" caught our eye and spiraled down toward the tree line (off in a great distance) then slowly rose up and traveled toward us. It was fluid and made no sound. Looked very very bright, almost sun-colored. It traveled from the south toward us and got to what seemed a few hundred yards away before veering to our left (east) and traveled away. It never lost it's brightness and the incredible thing is that even thought the sky was lit up with stars, the only visible object is the ufo. No flashing plane lights etc. 5 people watched intently and were all freaked out before it finally traveled out of sight I should also note that this the 4th sighting in this general era I've personally had and the 3rd with multiple witnesses. 3 were at night and 1 during the day Another note is that I,m highly educated, professional, sane, etc. not a quack"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48757.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48757.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/06/2013 11:57 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Region":"Pennsylvania","Summary":"EXTREMELY Brightly colored sphere that moved fluidly fast and silently","Longitude":"-76.580091","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"48757","Log Number":"US-07062013-0044","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States"}
