{"Date of the Event":"10/19/2009 06:36 UTC","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Flash","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy morning walk and pray'r time, stepp'd outside to the first clear morning in so many days. The stars were bright, constellations clear and present. No moon visible. Look'd up and noticed the Big Dipper to the North -- as I look'd into the top right of the constellation I noted a blimp of bright light exiting the confines of the dipper and proceed to the East. It was momentary but traveling and then disappear'd. There were no clouds nor haze. Then I turn'd to walk south and headed toward an open area, I could see Orion clearly, also Sirius, the Dog constellation and the Dog Star. From the tip top of Sirius the Dog Star came a pinpoint of bullet like traveling star moving toward the North-east rapidly. I watched it for about 40 seconds and it disappear'd. Lastly, as I gazed into the sky a shooting fireball fell between Orion's outstretched left arm and the Sirius Dog star."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20075.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20075.html"],"Log Number":"US-10222009-0005","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Waco","Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"31.552963","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Waco","There were no other sightings in Waco on or around October 19th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.552963,+-97.14302(20075)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20075) map </A>","Disposition":"Hoax","Case Number":"20075","Date Submitted":"10/22/2009 07:12 UTC","Summary":"Three Celestial Sightings","Longitude":"-97.14302"}
