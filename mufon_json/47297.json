It seemed to take about as long to travel its path as a normal commercial plane or propeller plane would. The light then became too dim to see anymore when it traveled to about 10 degrees above the horizon in the southeast."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.438366,+-83.479669(47297)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47297) map </A>","Latitude":"42.438366","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05092013-0015","Region":"Michigan","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
