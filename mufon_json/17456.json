{"Case Number":"17456","Date Submitted":"06/05/2009 10:00 UTC","Log Number":"BR-06132009-0006","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was returnig to my home by car. My position was very close to S���o Paulo (Brazil) downtown. A glitering object calls my atention in the sky ( about 45��� zenith angle) In my perception the objetct was very high ( about 6000 feet or more) What was very strange in these spot was the trajetory and the intensity of light: 1-The spot crosses the sky in a not linear trajetory ( going from right to left ) going up and down, stopping some times.I use some tall TV antenas to get a good geometrical reference to be sure about the trajetory. Note: my car was not moving because of intense car traffic that allow me to look to the sky during about 3 minutes. 2- The object shows a white light with an intensity oscilation ( it looks like a glitering). The light oscilation did not obey a frequency that could be similar to a normal airplane. Sometimes there was no light but only a grey spot for 2 or 3 secounds( I am not sure about the shape of the object because it was too high).But the light, in its maximum intensity, was very strong As the traffic allows me to move about 300 feet ahead, I park my car to get out and watch the fenomena better. This takes about 20 secounds, and when I look again to the sky where the objetc was moving, it was gone. Note: I am mechanical engineer and have a good logical perception of phisical fenomenas."],"Region":"SÃÂ£o Paulo","Country":"Brazil","Summary":"Glittering light spot swinging in a not linear trajectory.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"-23.543783","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/05/2009 10:00 UTC","City":"Sao Paulo","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-46.635748","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17456.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17456.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-23.543783,+-46.635748(17456)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17456) map </A>","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Sao Paulo","There were no other sightings in Sao Paulo on or around June 5th 2009"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
