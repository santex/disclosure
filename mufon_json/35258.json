It angled sharply upward then, all the time looking like it was afire, and finally, after maybe 3-5 minutes, disappeared when it was very high in the sky. It was traveling in a northeast direction. We have a lot of plane traffic but it was definitely not an aircraft. My first reaction was that it looked like a hot air balloon burning."],"City":"Inver Grove Heights","Log Number":"US-01262012-0072","Summary":"flaming \"ball\" traveling upward, 30 degrees angle, then sharply until disappeared very high up","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/24/2012 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"44.80026","Object Shape":"Fireball","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
