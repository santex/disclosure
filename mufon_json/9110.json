I'm thankful MUFON exists, and I'm not alone in the world as a credible witness to such amazing events. I recall my age As about 12 or 13, so it must have been about 1972 or 1973. It was a pleasant and clear-sky spring or summer day, I believe, and mid- to late afternoon. Memory a bit hazy on this. I was sitting on the ground in the middle of a large green space made up of at least three or four contiguous baseball fields. At the time, these fields were located between Brentwood Shopping Center on Winton Road, and the intersection of Winton and Galbraith Roads, in Finneytown, Ohio���a northern suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio. The field was next door to my home. So, there I was, in this field, reading a book. Reading was and is my passion, and I often visited this area to do this. At the time, I was on the only person present in this vast expanse of grass. While engaged in reading, for some reason I felt compelled to suddenly look in the sky. I think it must have been the flashing lights I saw when I did so. Seems that in this clear sky I saw a bright blue or red light with a ghostly gray object somehow behind it; no defined shape to it as it must have been too high in the sky. But it was blinking or flshing rapidly. Then another light joined it in the sky. And they were moving about above and in front of me; as if their lights were for me to see. At one point, both lights were to the left; then suddenly, they ���jumped��� to the right side of the sky as if they were instantly transported to that point in space, or had travelled at speed of light and then somehow put on super-brakes once they reached their destination in the sky. I did not have to move my head to watch them move back and forth; and somehow this fact made me think that they were very close to me. They'd also appear close together in front of me in the sky. They made no sound. I remember that detail very well. My first thought upon seeing all this was curiosity; then I was just caught up with the strangeness of the sight for a few minutes without a sense of fear. But as my mind began to grasp the reality of the situation, I became fearful without hysterics. I couldn���t believe what I was seeing, and knew that I had to get someone else to confirm that this strange event was really happening���and to get somewhere safe. I believed I was seeing UFOs, and there was a pattern of intelligence in the movements. So after at least 10 minutes of watching what I believe were up to three UFOs, I ran back to my home. It took less then 5 minutes to get to my front door. Upon entering my home I quickly and earnestly shared what had happened with my mother. I led my mom to the back bedroom on the second floor, which had a window facing the baseball fields and another window a few feet away on the adjacent wall. Together the windows gave us a good view of the outside. Right away, from that vantage point, mother and I both saw one cigar-shaped, matte-gray (not shiny) flying object come into view directly in our line of sight on our same plane. It was very close, and not blurry to our eyes at all. None of the others was seen. I do recall it had a few rapidly blinking lights (I think they were blue) arranged in a straight, vertical line. It was difficult to determine its size; but if I had to guess I���d say about 20 feet long. Relatedly, it was difficult to tell how far away it was from us; perhaps at least 50 to 70 feet. It was very close to the second-floor bedroom window; and stayed still for at least 10 seconds in plain sight; just hovering, as if it knew ���I��� was in there. (At least that���s how I felt!) Then it slowly moved away then shot off as if into nothingness. We continued to watch the sky but did not see any more flying objects after this one took off. My mother had the presence of mind to call the University of Cincinnati to find out if there had been reports of any UFO sightings. I don���t recall which department she called; neither does she; but it would make sense that she might have contacted a scientist at this large institution. Anyhow, surprisingly, she was told by a gentleman at the school that they had received MANY reports of UFO sightings that day from throughout the city! We were not alone in this experience apparently. No further contact was ever made by the school to us, or vice versa. This was the only organization we contacted; no police were involved in making a report as I think mom didn���t want us to be seen as being delusional or crazy citizens. My mother did not get hysterical during this entire episode, but she was excited. When I talked to her last week about it, she did say she remembered seeing a UFO but did not recall the details like I did. She did say she thought it was cigar shaped, though. (Back then she was about 40 years old and is now in her 70s and in good health.) I was sad to see that there were no reports of UFO sightings in our local daily paper, The Cincinnati Enquirer; at least I didn���t see any. Nor did view any stories on TV news or radio programs. Looking back, I���m not sure if people just didn���t contact the media���or they did, and the media decided to not cover the sightings. After this amazing encounter, I took out every UFO book I could find from the bookmobile. I recall reading about Project Blue Book in particular. (Side note: Can't believe all official govt. investigations are closed.) By reading such materials I thought I would validate what we had encountered and give us some sort of answers to questions that were understandably gnawing at us. At the very least, again, I discovered that we weren���t the only people to see similar ships, and that the details of these sightings had some commonalities with other sightings. As I grew up, I discovered a new attraction towards sci-fi novels and any type of space exploration TV shows. Today, I am an ardent fan of the Sci-Fi channel, and very open to the idea that we���ve probably been contacted by other-worldly civilizations���but our government is mum about such activities. That���s my take on the matter. I'm also a Catholic, but do not know how to integrate this experience into my faith life. Mom and I share a high level of ESP ability, and later I found out I qualified for MENSA. I do wonder if those were factors in us being \"chosen\" to see them--or was it all chance? Thank you for the opportunity to share my story. It���s not as thrilling or mind-boggling as many of your reports for Ohio, but in some small way I hope it encourages others to come forward to tell others about their experiences. I still do fear ridicule for telling the truth."],"Date Submitted":"05/31/1972 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Cincinnati","There were no other sightings in Cincinnati on or around May 31st 1972"]}
