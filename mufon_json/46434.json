I tried calling my son to bring out my camera, but he was taking a test..... I dropped my phone and when I looked up, it was gone...... It was a perfect view, as it floated up in front of the Moon... It looked like a cigar shape until it turned towards the moon.... Then I saw what I can describe as an appendage from the top center, that I could not see before it turned... It reminded me of a Bird of Prey??? Like a viewing tower in the center of the cigar, going up?..... Call me If you need more info>> Thank You"],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Dalton","There were no other sightings in Dalton on or around March 26th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
