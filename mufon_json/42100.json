After I set up the tripod and connected the camera there it was, moving steadly in my direction N, bright and glowing, coming out of the SW at 7:43 PM, clear skys. I tried to flash it with my flashlight to see what it might do, but also tring to keep it in frame and focus-very hard to do. It came a little closer then drifted back off to the SE and out of sight blocked by the trees. I think it knew I was tring to film it, usually it comes right over head (a lot closer). Im kinda disapointed I couldnt get a close up view to what the craft really looks like, I tried to focus in on it and it would just get disorted so I had to zoom back out on it.I think it might be a little camera shy."],"Summary":"Glowing Object In Sky","Log Number":"US-08282012-0012","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.803606","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42100.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42100.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","City":"Decatur","Region":"Illinois","Longitude":"-88.921254","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Decatur","There was one other sighting in Decatur on or around August 27th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"42100","Sighting Duration":"00:02:51","Object Features":"Unknown"}
