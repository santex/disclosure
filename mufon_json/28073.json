My wife and kids had just gone inside. Something in the sky caught my eye; I looked up to see a black diamond shaped object in the southern area of the sky traveling north at an incredible rate of speed, it was completely silent, it stopped suddenly went east stopped suddenly again and continued north. It was black, diamond shaped but not pointy more rounded. It had neon blueish indigo-ish lights, like no color i have ever seen, that were spinning too fast to count. It a appeared very large and was about half way between me and the clouds. I had goosebumps for a half hour after it was gone. For a week before and every night since the sighting I have awoke unexplainably EVERY morning at exactly 3 am. ; I'm not sure if it is related or not. This was not my first sighting, but it was the first one during daylight."],"Source":"MUFON"}
