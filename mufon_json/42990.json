Its somewhat cloudy, and it appeared to glow through the clouds. I stopped briefly, then decided it was nothing. This was at 9 PM. I went to the gym, worked out for 35 minutes. I walked out of the gym at 9:40, and glanced up to notice the exact same strange light, except now there were 10+, perhaps 12-15, and they were much further out toward the northeast. They looked star-like, but definitely werent stars, Im a frequent sky-observer. They were probably (very rough estimate) 10 miles away. Im not much of a UFO guy, but it definitely got my heart racing. It was exciting more than anything. Eventually they just disappeared at different rates. My first thought was some sort of flare, but they looked too high in the sky, and Ive seen the military drop flares before. They didnt look like this."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/03/2012 02:08 UTC","Region":"Alaska","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42990.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42990.html"],"Longitude":"-149.890468","City":"Anchorage","Tags":"City","Summary":"{dr}ingle orange light, then 10+ orange lights over the ocean.","Case Number":"42990","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
