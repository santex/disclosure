{"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"11/30/1968 10:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting Details This happened a long time ago but it started to bother me because my friend forgot about the sighting. We were vacationing in Running Springs,Ca. in either 68 or 69. We were returning to the cabin, walking down the street in the woods, when a bright light appeared over us. We were instantly afraid and we crawled under bushes there. It went away and we finally got up and continued walking. The funny thing was that even though we remained friends for years we didnt talk about it.I saw her and her husband for dinner in 2000 and laughingly commented on the UFOexperience but her face got a funny look on it and she said she didnt rememberanything about it.I think it scared both of us at that time.Her because shedidnt remember and me because I did.Hope you can use this.Jan"],"Latitude":"34.207786","Case Number":"2765","Log Number":"","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Running Springs","There were no other sightings in Running Springs on or around November 30th 1968"],"Summary":"Running Springs,California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.207786,+-117.109205(2765)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2765) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Running Springs","Date Submitted":"11/30/1968 10:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-117.109205","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2765.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2765.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:30:00"}
