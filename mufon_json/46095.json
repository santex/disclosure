I herd a humm like noise outside and At first I had the feeling that I was being watched but then noticed a constant humm. I looked outside to try and figure out what it may be. My head started to hurt as I got close to the window. I looked up and there was this fuzzy object just hovering over the trees. It stayed in the same spot for about 5 minutes befor quickly darting across the sky. It scared me. My heart beat fast, it got harder to breath, my head hurt and my body got heavy. I felt scared. Like my life was threatened. My feelings were as if I was lost. Like I didn't know what was going on. I felt as if I just got out of a horror house. It made me scared to go back to sleep. It has been 34 hours since I last slept. I lost sight of the object when it started to dart across the sky. Kinda Like a bird does when you get to close. Like I had scared it. But it wasn't animal. It wasn't an aircraft. It wasn't something that was very common. Nothing in the sky stays in one spot then quickly flys away. Nothing."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Unknown","Region":"Kentucky","trends":[],"Case Number":"46095","Longitude":"-84.265558"}
