Itwas brighter than a star, plane or satellite. I asked my sister if she saw ittoo. She did, and we watched it move from very bright to very faint and finallydisappear. It was all in an upward motion (that was to the north). Right afterthat one disappeared, we saw another bright light that did the same thing as thefirst, only in a different direction (still upwards). We saw a satellite fly byright after the second sigting, and it was not of the same nature. It wasdefinelty something we have not seen before. For the past month, we have alsobeen seeing strange objects in the sky during the day. They are very high inthe sky and seem to hover. They dont really move and are very metallic. Theare pencil shaped and appear to be a silver metal color. At each sighting,there was more than one person witnessing them. On one occasion, the pencilshaped sighting disapeared like the lights did tonight."]}
