Our property is far from any major city, so the sky is very starry at night. Aproximatley 12:00 am she took me outside so that I could wittness this event for my own eyes. As best as I can describe of what I saw, is as follows: For a few minutes nothing moved. Then I saw what looked like a star moving north, then came to a complete stop. It then proceded to go the exact opposite direction, in which it then stoped again. This time, it began to fly around in circles, and proceded to go south west, then came to a complete halt, then dissapeared.
