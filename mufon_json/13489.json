As we were passing a 711 and a doctor's office out of the corner of my left eye I saw what I thought at the time was a big tree on fire. When I turned my head to look I was about to say \"Hey, guys look at that tree, but then I saw a huge glowing red and orange ball shoot into the sky from behind the tree. It went straight into the air without turning and it was about the size of a large van. It all happened so fast I didn't have time to say anything, but my friend Ivan in the front seat yelled \"WHO ELSE SAW THAT?!\" The driver of the car said she had seen it also and she seemed very disturbed by it. It shot into the air so fast that it was out of sight within at the very most 5 seconds."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-73.046336"}
