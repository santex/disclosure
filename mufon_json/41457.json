They were bright, and looked like flames in the sky. Very odd. They hovered for about 10 seconds, and then started moving all at the same time at the same speed like they were flying together observing almost. There was also a thunderstorm at that moment, and I tried taping it but none of the lights show up on my video even when lightning strikes, you can't see a thing. But in reality...they were very bright, and orange-y reddish color and looked like flames. There was nothing else in the sky until they were gone, and you can clearly see the difference between a plane and helicopter and these lights. very odd."],"Latitude":"44.069021","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.069021,+-116.917467(41457)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41457) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Payette","Summary":"Lights in the sky","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41457.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41457.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ontario","Longitude":"-116.917467","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/05/2012 02:52 UTC"}
