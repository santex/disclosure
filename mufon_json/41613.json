(the start of the z was very close to the starting point of the first orange flash and ended way past the point where the first light faded out) thought it was a metiorite shower and i just saw 3 meteorites who's flight paths had just crossed each other, but then i thought if it was that the z shape wouldn't be continuous (which it was). there were no trails behind any of the flashes, it was just what looked like an separate orange light moving at a very fast speed, it didn't stop or even appear to slow down in the turns of the z shape. i live near a flight path so im used to seeing planes in the sky, this was definitely like no other i had ever seen, also it was travelling so fast i thought it was a shooting star so obviously moved a lot faster than any plane\\helicopter\\satellite another strange thing about it was it appeared to have an effect of my phone, i was on it as i saw the lights and it froze and lost all signal about 5 seconds before and after both the lights, i don't know if the lights caused this but it's a brand new phone that didn't do that before or since personally, am pretty sure it was some sort of e.t. ship."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"0.550927"}
