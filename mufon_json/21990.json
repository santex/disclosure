{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/23/2010 08:09 UTC","divs":["Sighting Detailsme and father were traveling from spfld illinois to decatur il approx 530-6-630 am when i seen a star type object pulsating far ahead off to the right..realizing it was to bright to be a plane i couldnt understand how it was so bright being obviously sooo far away..i asked my dad if he seen it and he said yes its probably a plane or helicopter so i said \"thats awful bright dont you think\"...so im watching and watching this light as i had seen unknown objects in the sky before several times....so im glued to these lights and then what seemed like 2-3 minutes after watching it at that distance it came at us in the blink of an eye what seemed to be about half the distance NOW CLOSER and for what seemed another 20-30 seconds i watched this one light.NOW CONVINCED THIS IS SOMETHING STRANGE i continued to watch..again in the blink of an eye the 1 light went to 2 white lights...and onlt for about 3 seconds it remained 2 lights..the 2 lights then went to a red and blueish green like ive never seen b4..the red was so bright blood red with some kind of orange in it...at this point i looked at my dad and said oh my god dad are you seeing this..and he said yes...i begged him to stop so i could get out and see better .he said exact words \"hell no\"..ok so now these 2 lights went to the red and blue colors and was strobbing super fast unlike any strobe effects ive ever seen..and i noticed only by the flashes of strobe how it was moving around us cuz it was dark and i couldnt actualy make out a shape...logicaly thinking i looked back at the highway to see if the road was turning or if in fact it was this ufo moving..sure enough the road was str8 as far as i could see behind AND in front of us so this THINGmovd bythetime i looked back at the ufo it had yet again moved (my dad was speachless or i just dont remember him saying much only looking at it and trying to drive at the same time.. so i am now TOTALY CONVINCED THIS IS A UFO..it did 3 (what i call ) skips where it flew at least what appeared to be a 2-3 mile distance PER SKIP it was like zoom-zoom-zoom and each zoom was a 2-3 mile distance coming to a complete stop in between skips but for only a fraction of a second it paused between skips..now how the hell could this be a human occupied craft? the g force alone would flatten a human...also there was absolutly no sign of jet perpulsion or fire boost rockets or NOTHING...after the 3rd \"skip\" i noticed it was on the direct side of vehicle about 2 city blocks away from our truck...and the red abd blue strobs went about 4-5 strobs each and i could tell it was gaining distance between each flash of the strobe and they wwere super fast strobes so the distance had to be like i said before at kleast 2 miles each time...also i have witnessed very bright cigar shaped craft in broad daylight near st louis for approx 2 minutes slanted..extremly huge and very far away making it in my opinion extra terestrial craft..i have seen a cluster of 6 near chicago during sunrise hours lasted nearly 10-12 minutes..as a child(my 1st sighting) i seen what then in thought was saturn or the planet with rings? i seen this in late afternoon on a school bus on the way home...many years later after other sighting i can only speculate i had a sighting as a child bcuz you cant see saturn in the daytime from your school bus...lol i assume the \"rings\" on what i saw was actualy a disc of some kind ? ok that was alot of typing and you probably think im crazy..lol this is some serious stuff...we are not alone!!"],"Longitude":"-89.643658","Latitude":"39.789201","City":"Springfield","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"light changed from 1 light to 2 lights","Object Shape":"Flash, Saturn-like, Star-like, Other","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Springfield","There were no other sightings in Springfield on or around August 3rd 1997"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21990.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21990.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/03/1997 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.789201,+-89.643658(21990)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21990) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02232010-0006","Region":"Illinois","Case Number":"21990","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
