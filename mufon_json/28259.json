I have had several sightseeings at this place , but this is the only evidence I captured , \"accidentally\" , because my Mom took the picture and I was with my back towards the event . I really believe it���s possible to be an UFO , because I lived at this place 6 months of my life , and I know this place very well . It could not be a weather ballon , because right after this picture ( 20 seconds ) , it was taken another picture and the object was not there anymore . This place ( SANA -- A district of the city of MACA��� ) is 130 km from Rio de Janeiro , it���s a rural area , with very low population and it is famous to be a sightseeing place , as I said , I have had many sightseeings at this place . I would really like this picture to be analysed by experts , and just in case , I have the original one and looks just the same , taken by a non digital camera . Hope to hear from you soon , thanks for your atention , because I have sent this pictures to many Brazilian net sites and got no answer . When my mom took the picture , I was at a desert site , with no houses at my sightseeing , going to a desert waterfall . The first time I noticed the object I was pretty sure it was an UFO , just like I said before , I noticed it 2 and a half years after the event , last saturday , when I was scanning the picture ."],"Date of the Event":"06/23/2008 01:00 UTC","Longitude":"-41.785728","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Macaé","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"Brazil","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere"}
