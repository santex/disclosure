{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Flash","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08102012-0003","divs":["Sighting DetailsI observed an unidentified object two nights in a row hovering about 30 degrees above the horizon, directly west of Pahrump, Nevada. Object is stationary for a long time. Observed with 8 power binoculars, but couldn't get a clear image. I'll try to get a 50-60 power telescope tomorrow in case the object comes back. It is a little further East tonight than it was last night. I watched an airliner fly right under it around 11 to 11:15pm.Very beautiful flashing colors, definitely different from anything that I have ever seen before."],"City":"Pahrump","Latitude":"36.214394","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"08/10/2012 02:32 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/09/2012 11:20 UTC","Longitude":"-115.979275","Region":"Nevada","Summary":"Bright flashing light hovering about 10,000 feet above airplane flight path,","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.214394,+-115.979275(41600)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41600) map </A>","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Pahrump","There were no other sightings in Pahrump on or around August 9th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41600.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41600.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"41600"}
