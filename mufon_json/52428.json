{"Summary":"Black, Misty, Triangular, blocked out stars, flying from North to South, Made no sound,","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Bellevue","There were no other sightings in Bellevue on or around November 25th 2013"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside my back door looking into the sky like I do on regular occurrences just gazing at the stars. When looking straight up I saw a large dark triangular shadow pass over the top of my house and neighborhood heading from North to South. It had some haziness to the front sides of the triangle. Made no noise and was traveling pretty fast for an object that size. Larger than any plane I have ever seen even at the altitude it was flying (I live next to an Air Force Base)."],"Date of the Event":"11/25/2013 09:55 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.112364,+-95.951802(52428)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52428) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.112364","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52428.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52428.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Log Number":"US-11252013-0015","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Bellevue","Region":"Nebraska","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/25/2013 11:27 UTC","Case Number":"52428","Longitude":"-95.951802","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
