The region is rural countryside, very low light pollution. It was flying in a circular pattern for about 10 minutes with a large radius to the flight path. During the observation, the lights would occasionally fade out and return, but with no set pattern to the fading and return to visibility. I had my camera (a Canon DSLR) and was able to snap 3 pictures. I was having difficulty focusing due to the distance and darkness. One picture came out fairly decent, but the other 2 suffer from camera shake. I zoomed in on the one good one and found 5 white lights and 1 red light."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Pleasant Hill","There were no other sightings in Pleasant Hill on or around July 3rd 2012"],"Date Submitted":"07/04/2012 11:36 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40146.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40146.html"],"Object Features":"Other"}
