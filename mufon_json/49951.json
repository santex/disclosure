{"Latitude":"42.177785","Object Shape":"Other","divs":["Sighting DetailsWent outside to let dogs out and saw bright red light over house at the same time dad saw them from the front window. First there were 2 then three more. The were all in a straight line going from east to west and seemed to disappear in the night sky. There was no sound and we could tell the difference between airplanes flying over head and these things. Are they drones? It was too far in the sky to see a shape, but lights were very noticeable. Very bright red. We would like to know if anyone else saw them. I have never witnessed this before. It did not seem like 1 object since they appeared one at a time. The red lights went in a straight line and disappeared one by one in the sky. Sorry if this isn't informative enough, never saw this before. Have some video but not that great and have to figure out how to download."],"Summary":"2 people saw red lights 2 at first flying in a row then 5 in total","City":"Romulus","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/17/2013 10:24 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-83.363897","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"49951","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49951.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/17/2013 09:55 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.177785,+-83.363897(49951)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49951) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Romulus","There were no other sightings in Romulus on or around August 17th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-08172013-0037"}
