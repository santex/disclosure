{"Region":"Ohio","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"bright,two sections/blobs , no sound, seen two 1/2 hour apart","Tags":"City","Case Number":"42167","Log Number":"US-08312012-0006","divs":["sighting detailsi was in my back yard adjusting my satellite dish and looked up to the se and seen a bright object with two obvious sections or blobs going from sw to ne in a straight line. the object wasn't tiny,but wasn't enormous looking,it was a little less than pencil width at arms length. there was no sound before,during or after i seen it,just a clear,bright,quiet evening.my wife and daughter seen it,too. it could have been anything,but i couldn't make out a definite shape like a plane. the sun reflecting off a plane seems reasonable,but still looked strange to me. it took a minute or two to get so far away that it became a tiny speck,no contrails,no sounds at all. i did take several digital photos of it and finally realized why ufo photos are fuzzy,no long distance lens. my photos on the computer showed nothing till i enlarged them. i used the sony cyber shot. when enlarged it kinda looked like what i saw,but actually looking at it the image was sharper edged.i took the camera in and loaded the pics on my computer and when i went outside i left the camera there om the porch and came back several times to adjust the dish and about 1\\2 hour later the almost exact circumstances happened again,also witnessed by my wife and daughter. my only confusion was the object each time looked exactly alike and went the same straight route was alot bigger than the high-flying commercial jets,which are usually easily heard outside on a quiet day. i have seen smaller looking propellor planes make noise too, but absolutely no sound. i took pics the second time and got fuzzy blobs when enlarged just as before. i would love for some genius to clear my pics up to see if its a plane or what? i attached the unenlarged photos and could get an enlarged one to stay enlarged when attached."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Bidwell","Date Submitted":"08/31/2012 01:39 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-82.29917","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/30/2012 07:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42167.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42167.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.91861,+-82.29917(42167)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42167) map </A>","Latitude":"38.91861","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bidwell","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
