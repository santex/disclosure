We had just finished dinner and went to our cabin which had a balcony on the starboard side of the ship on deck 9. I went out onto the balcony to have a smoke and it was pretty stormy. Couldn't see any other objects except the sea and the misty dark sky. All of a sudden a well defined pill shaped object with a dull glow went in a perfectly straight line from the front of the ship to the back. When it reached the back it took a sudden turn downward and I thought it was going to go into the sea but instead it curved around the back of the ship. This only took about 10 seconds from start to finish. I couldn't believe what I saw and debated whether or not I should report it. I stayed out on the balcony for about twenty more minutes hoping it would return but it never did. I told my wife but did not report it to the ships crew because I thought they would think I was some kind of a nut. I currently live in Las Vegas just 90 miles from Area 51 and I have never seen anything like this before. I want to be clear that it didn't look metallic. It was closer to being some kind of dull light or energy but shaped like a pill with crisp edges. I am a web designer and self trained graphic artist and have done my best to recreate what I saw. I just wish someone else would have filed a report and I could have backed up their report."],"Date of the Event":"10/13/2011 10:15 UTC","City":"Halifax","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Halifax","There was one other sighting in Halifax on or around October 13th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"32679","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-63.569432","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32679.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32679_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32679.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-10172011-0029","Region":"Nova Scotia","Country":"Canada"}
