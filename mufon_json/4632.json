There are things I remember from one evening to this day.","Date Submitted":"03/05/1968 07:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsi was going home from a friend's home (rita whitaker) walking between the nco housing to the officers housing where i lived in the late 60's. i got to the officer's housing side of the road separating the two housing areas. i remember the area where i stopped as a dry playground area with a large swing set. i remember stopping dead in my tracks because i knew something was there then over me, and then a bright light that lit up everything around me including the swing set. i do not remember noise to speak of. i don't remember feeling fear. the thing seemed to just be sitting above me. i then remember me just in awe or something limp and not moving, and standing looking up seeing a round or round-like shape on at least the part that i could see though the light. the bright light went out and then i could see more of the colored lights and the it was gone. i don't remember being able to see it leave, it just seemed to be there and then not there. all i remember after that was a feeling that unexplained time had passed by because it was now dusk and getting cooler, and after it left it was dark and i started to run home. i vividly remember feeling like i had to hurry because i was going to get into bug trouble for not being home by dark. i also felt that this incident was overwith as fast as it started. it seemed like an instant but at the same time much more than an instant in time. my parents never remembered, but i remember my mother saying something about my sunburn. off and on through the years i have questioned my father about things. he says he has no knowledge of a ufo sighting that would have been so close to luke afb during his station. he was a pilot. i know something unexplainable happened to me, and i know it was not a helicopter or other explainable aircraft of that day. i knew this when it happened, and i know it today. i have told close friends, sisters, and parents of this incident; but no one cares much to hear about it. they just shake their heads and say they don't have any doubt i say something as a child that was unexplainable. i feel disconnected sometimes, because i don't think they do understand. it makes me feel like a looney tune. this experience did happen to me, and even at the age i was; i was smart enough to remember things all these years. i yearn to talk to others who may have had an experience, but i don't know anyone. i don't remember the exact date and time, but know that it was either during the last year or the year before the last year that we lived on luke afb. and, i don't remember it being horribly hot. so i don't believe this happened during summer months. i wrote about this one other time somewhere on-line, but didn't hear anything back. i can't even remember what the website was now. not too much to report, no pictures, and no other witnesses that i am personally aware of. however, i have always had this desire to know more about ufo's, since this encounter. i am facinated by anything i can watch, and read searching for things that support my own sighting and feelings. i don't know if it means anything, but after this sighting i have had strong feelings about some things before they actually happen. i guess you might call them premenitions. also, with no seizure or epilepsy history on either sude of my families; i had a seizure at the age of 46. i had heard something on a program that either all or nearly all of the men on a famous ufo case had seizures later in life after their sighting\\abduction. who really knows if anything is related to a single incident. i feel like an infant trying to soak in everything i can learn to come that much closer to some kind of answer for this unknown, strange, and before it happened unimaginable experience. i saw a hypnotherepist on t.v., and wonder how much money it would cost me to see if there is more that i can't remember on the surface or to verify that something did happen to me. i feel connected to something out there and don't know what it is. is there any information you can provide like any other case like mine that was close or on luke a.f.b. during the time that i am reporting? thank you for allowing me to at least document this. i hope that whoever reads this will understand my curiosity and unending desire to search for answers. heidi maule"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-04042006-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4632.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4632.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.543382,+-112.183627(4632)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4632) map </A>","Longitude":"-112.183627"}
