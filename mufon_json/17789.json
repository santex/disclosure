I had noticed a shiny dot in the sky and thought it was probably a plane which would not be unusual because that is where their incoming flight pattern is. I kept my eye on it as I was pulling into my parking spot and I noticed that it did not move like I had expected it to. I began to think at this point that it might be a UFO. I parked my car quickly and ran out to where I thought I could get a better view and it was gone. In May of 2008 I had witnessed a similar sphere and a photo of it appeared on the UFO Casebook website. So this time I was more aware of what I may have witnessed."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-07042009-0010","Summary":"Sphere in the SW sky near Portland, Oregon!","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were no other sightings in Portland on or around July 4th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17789.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17789.html"],"Latitude":"45.526762","Case Number":"17789"}
