It bounced around, mainly up and down, almost crossing paths with a commercial airplane at one point. this went on for over 20 minutes, we attempted to take photos with our phones and eventually got the video camera and got footage of it's actions. It's behavior was certainly not that of any aircraft we have seen before and it dimmed and brightened throughout the event. we eventually went inside after not being able to identify it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.223609,+-82.451344(22029)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22029) map </A>","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Land O' Lakes","There were no other sightings in Land O' Lakes on or around February 27th 2010"],"Tags":"City"}
