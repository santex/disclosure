There was a small black dot in the middle. I scrolled closer there was a darker shadow starting in front of and trialing far behind the round object.[Looks like a shock wave??] Scrolling closer there is a long \"tail\" [looks like a contrail??]Scrolling closer the cicular object has a black oval in back, yellow debis is streaming over the front edge giving an indication the front is round. I scrolled out and the object is of a small island in the Kara sea just off the north coast of Russia. From the pictures I guess it was under water. It was heading it looked like East-North-East. Iprinted up 7 pictures from different depths. Why would Google Earth come on in that exact location???
