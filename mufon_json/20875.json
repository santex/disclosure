windygates heading along the main road to kirkcaldy(a915)at about 7:10 i noticed a very bright light(south east) very low on the horizon in the direction we were heading. i quickly put on my glasses to have a closer look. at first i thought it was the top of a town���s christmas tree due to its position and height but as we were approaching the roundabout we gained higher ground and i could see 2 bright lights in the distance. because of this new vantage point i concluded it was no longer the top of a christmas tree nor was it a star, the only star i could see was very high up just to the left of the moon which i believe to be the north star. as we passed the roundabout and carried onto kirkcaldy i could make out a 3rd light. i noticed that the 3 lights were all different colours and arranged in a triangle, i got very excited and took a few pictures but none of them worked, camera phones are terrible. the object on the left, which was the tip of the triangle in my opinion was a yellow light, the 1 on the bottom right was an orange reddish light and the 1 on the top right was a bright white light. none of them pulsed nor did it occur to me this was anything but a squadron of helicopters, even though i did find the colours odd. it wasn���t till i got my phone out to take a picture on my camera that i noticed something strange. i rolled down the window so there wouldn���t be a reflection when i took a photo and there was no noise. if these were helicopters i expected to hear them, then i realised that these 3 lights actually might be connected by a structure, as i started to make out 3 sides connecting the 3 lights like a triangle. it then appeared to turn clockwise. my mum and i were so intrigued by this that we pulled into wells green which we had just approached. turns out we weren���t the only ones that found these lights odd as other cars started pulling into the driving ranges car park as well. i took my mums camera out her back, got out the car and headed down the wee road to get a better look. i was about midway down with the driving range exactly on my right and could quite clearly see the 3 lights just above the tree line. i tried to take pictures of the object but the flood lights from the range made it very difficult to get a picture of lights in the distance and i still couldn���t hear anything. so i eventually gave up and got back in the car. we drove on still heading to kirkcaldy. i could still see the 3 lights still emitting the same colours then suddenly the two lights on the right broke off and moved off to the right of my view and disappeared in the distance. i managed to keep an eye one the light left behind. after about 5 minutes of it being left alone and stationary it started to change colour, it didn���t pulsate, it seemed to fade out of its yellow tinge and fade into green and then red in a seamless way, when it got back to yellow that���s when i knew this was no aircraft that was currently known to me and i had researched many classified and secret craft from the b2 to the supposed aurora craft. as i stared out the rear passenger side window the object flew with immense speed towards where the other 2 had gone. my head literally turned in about 3 seconds as i followed the object and which also disappeared into the distance. now we were travelling at about 60 miles per hour and this object seemed very, very far away so for it to then pull of at the speed it did and stay at the same distance from us, overtaking us and disappearing into the distance meant this object would have to be going almost supersonic speed something like mach 6 which i know no human could survive nor do we have any aircraft that can go that fast to my knowledge. i thought that that had been the end of it as we approached kirkcaldy but then i could see the 3 lights had met up and were again in triangle formation the exact way they had been before but now further away in the distance from our location. my mum asked me if i wanted to go down to kirkcaldy promenade\\esplanade to take a better look as we drove along dunkier rd, i said yes so we did. we turned off at the roundabout at asda and headed down overton rd to the prom. during this time i could not see the objects however when we arrived and stopped at the truck parking end of the prom i could see the 3 objects over the water (north east), they were slightly higher than before and had split up. yet again the yellow 1 was all by its self but the other 2 had seemed to almost join together side by side and were glowing red and white. they were moving off to the right as i stared out at them, i had to turn to watch them move over land, they were fairly close or at least close enough that i should have been able to hear an engine or rotor, but it was silent. i quickly turned my attention back to the yellow one which by this time had started moving back towards the way it came. i attempted to take pictures but alas my mothers camera is not very good and i got the feeling that even though these lights were bright they were too far away to be picked up so i gave up on trying to snap shots and just focused on visually remembering the events. i turned to see how the other two on the right were doing and they had vanished. i decided to focus all my attention on the yellow one. it was moving at a steady pace keeping its altitude and suddenly as it moved through the clear black sky 2 stars just appeared out of nowhere 1 over the other and the object passed in-between them and carried on its course. it eventually disappeared in the direction it had came but the 2 stars remained. i ran back to the car, my mum had been on the phone with my dad to inform him of our situation and what we were doing, that was at about 7:30. we left about 7:35."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1
