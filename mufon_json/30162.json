The person that accompanied me as well saw this..It appeared to be rather large,unknown exact shape,bright bright white(kind of yellowish)light(s),with a distintive red light(s) underneath. It seemed as if the object was revolving slowly but still remaining in the same area. As I was,(along with the person that was with me)kept staring at this object(never looking away)started to fade away but quickly right before my eyes and the way it disappeared like that,was not in any way humanly operated,if that makes sense. this ordeal probably lasted only for 2 to 3 minutes max. After this,my hair standed all on end and I proceeded to run back in my house. Ive read about people reporting sightings all my life but never thought Id be one of them. This is the second up close sighting Ive seen in the past month."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30162.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30162.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Apple Valley","Summary":"rather large,sort of revolving object in sky,very bright white/red light(s)undermeath~HIGHDESERT!","Date Submitted":"07/14/2011 02:01 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Apple Valley","There were no other sightings in Apple Valley on or around July 12th 2011"]}
