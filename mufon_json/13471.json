It was flickering and moving VERY FAST in an erratic manor over the ocean at an elavation between 0 and 1000 feet both horizontaly and verticaly. There were objects also in the distance that were stable that could have been boats. This object at one point swept down and seemed to rest on the surface of the water for maybe 15 seconds before moving again. This could not have been anything other than something unknown. The pattern of flight was just to eratic!!!!! This was my first real sighting, so it was very exicting too me!! I tried to take a video of this on my cell phone, but it did not work :-( I should buy a high def camera,"],"Summary":"FAST FLICKERING LIGHT OVER THE OCEAN MAKING VERY FAST MOVES UP AND DOWN","Latitude":"33.020826","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-117.278897","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.020826,+-117.278897(13471)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13471) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13471.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13471.html"],"Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Encinitas","There were no other sightings in Encinitas on or around November 1st 2008"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Encinitas","Case Number":"13471","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11022008-0003","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Object Features":"Unknown"}
