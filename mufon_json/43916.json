They were moving together very slowly northeast. I began to follow it thinking they were just ballons that happend to make that shape and quickly break apart. They didnt and I noticed they were all pulsating. I followed it to Broadway and than the objects stopped in formation. The top one began to pulsate brighter than the others. The top orb began to fade to the about the same light as the others and than it continued to move North West for about a minute. After that, the lights slowly began to fade. One by one each of the globes light dimmed unit all of them were gone. About a few minutes later, two helicopters were in the same area with lights pointing to the ground. It looks like they were scanning the area."],"Region":"New York","Longitude":"-73.902345","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Followed 4 Globes Moving Over Bushwick"}
