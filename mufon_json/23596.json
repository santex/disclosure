It was friday night and I got off work at about 11:00pm. I hung out around work for a bit with friends and and headed home at about 11:30. I walked around to the back of the building and noticed a formation of 7-8 orange lights moving slowly, making no noise at all, to the southeast and low. They emerged from behind a skyscraper heading north, so I pulled out my camera and started filming. They crossed just overhead of a full moon, creating a beautiful shot. I got about 45 seconds of footage and stopped for a better angle. When I looked up again, they were gone. I only wish that I would've captured them vanishing."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle, Other"}
