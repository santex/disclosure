The first one I saw was (is) in the northeast facing east, the brighter (closer one) is in the southeast facing west. They are not moving last night they both moved quite alot from where I saw them originaly. I went to the same place I was when my grandson his girl friend and my son saw them. they are all asleep right now. had no trouble picking them out . they look almost like stars but once I watch them I can see A little difference. when I was on break at workI faced my car where they would be and could see one even though I could see no stars from work.
