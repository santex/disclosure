Visible prominate objects were Spica and Saturn in a cloudless sky. I had observed an aircraft at high altitude with a northerly heading at an elevation in line with Saturn. I started to turn away, to the east, and a bright flash caught my attention, midway and above the instesect between Spica and Saturn. As I turned to see what it was it increased in brilliance by a factor of 2 to 3 times. It extinquished very rapidly and I observed an object, point of light, moving away on a northerly trajectory. I observed it for ~ 45 seconds until it was lost in the night sky nearly overhead. It had overtaken the aircraft, lower altitude, well before it disappeared."]}
