Thought at first it was an airplane, but instantly realized that it wasnt. The object would light up and then the light would go away and then light up again. I would have to describe it similar to that of a lightning bug. As a lightning bug will light up, go dark, move into different area and then light up yet again. Knowing this wasnt a bug, nor was it a plane, as it had an erratic flight pattern, and within maybe 2 minutes of seeing the object it just disappeared. Also around the same time perhaps 7 days prior we saw an object in the sky approximately 600feet up that was cylindrical in shape, with one light on each end that appeared to be almost as if it were slithering as though it were a snake. It lasted about 5 minutes til we could no longer see it due to a wooded area near our home. Both occurances were at our home and were observed from the backyard."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-81.587967","Date of the Event":"10/10/2010 09:28 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Fort Stewart","There were no other sightings in Fort Stewart on or around October 10th 2010"],"Case Number":"26112","Country":"United States","Region":"Georgia","Latitude":"31.884973","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Spherical object emitting light in spurts/cylindrical object","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26112.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26112.html"],"Log Number":"US-10252010-0015","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Sphere","Date Submitted":"10/25/2010 09:18 UTC"}
