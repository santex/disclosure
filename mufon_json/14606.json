A cold front had came through the area around 4:00 pm that day and it was cloudy and pretty high winds from the north. Stopped in Coleman for about 15 minutes did not think any more about it, was headed SE out of Coleman on Hwy 84 towards Santa Anna and looked to the NE and I seen the same object. I did not stop and look at it, was for some reason in hurry to catch the second half of the Cowboys. Just curious if anyone else seen the object."],"City":"Novice","Summary":"Bright white star like object in sky.","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"14606","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.989587,+-99.623686(14606)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14606) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12292008-0019","Date of the Event":"12/20/2008 07:30 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Novice","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/20/2008 07:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
