Every night like clock work a couple of family members and myself go out to watch the skies. The number of orbs differ from night to night. One night 24 high flying orbs and others not so much. So tonight I take the dog for a walk in a field across from the house. Looking up in the sky(south)facing Denver I see a high flying orb moving at a high rate of speed. Knowing its not a plane because there is no flashing FAA lights under or on the sides. Also while it(orb) approaches a airplane with red and green flashing FAA lights approaches from the west over my location. Knowing its not a plane I attempt to contact the craft with a green flash light. As I try morris code, not knowing morris code. The craft slows its flying speed and lights up brighter than any star in the sky. As it slowing down I began to flash the light more rapid. It blinked or flashed at me than dimmed back to its original brightness, picked its speed back up and kept heading north from Denver."],"Latitude":"39.899828","Date of the Event":"09/30/2008 08:10 UTC"}
