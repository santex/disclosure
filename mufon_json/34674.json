I realized that planes don't just fall slowly, helicopters do that. I hid in this brush because it wasn't a helicopter, it hovered for maybe five minutes before it landed, people came out in these uniforms, they had big round eyes, one had almond shaped goggles on, I hid there for about twenty more minutes, before that took and animal or something back onto the plane, I felt like the one with the goggles was looking at me, he like smiled or some @#$%, I was scared, but when he looked at me I felt comforted, I blacked out at one point and woke up in my yard, where I had seen the ship, a helicopter was going slowly by, it wasnt a loud copter, so I thought maybe that was what I saw before, but then a couple days later it hit me, I remembered it, I had to take the day off work because I was too shaky to write"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"12/16/2011 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.433214,+-104.704202(34674)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34674) map </A>","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Greeley","There were no other sightings in Greeley on or around December 16th 2011"],"Sighting Duration":"00:30:30","Log Number":"US-01062012-0024","Date Submitted":"01/06/2012 06:47 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-104.704202","Region":"Colorado","Summary":"Looked out window, ran outside, saw lights, hid on ground, things came out, went back in with animal or something","Case Number":"34674","City":"Greeley","Latitude":"40.433214","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
