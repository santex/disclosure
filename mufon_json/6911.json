We all got out of the car and watched the object pass from right to left then back to the right and the accelerate straight up with a speed greater than any Thunderbird or Blue Angel .We asked each other to confirm what each of us had just seen .We all said exactly the same and no sooner had we all agreed,then the object came back and made a very similar pass, again, leaving by going straight up.There was no doubt the object was real and we all instantly knew it was some sort of craft unknown to any of us.We were very excited and felt fortunate to have seen it."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Roosevelt","There were no other sightings in Roosevelt on or around October 20th 1968"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-109.98876","Date of the Event":"10/20/1968 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.299403,+-109.98876(6911)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6911) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6911.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6911.html"],"Case Number":"6911","Date Submitted":"10/20/1968 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Utah","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"red-orange glowing as heated metal sphere shaped noiseless.Smooth motion but sharp abrupt turns, not banking nor coordinated like aircraft .","Latitude":"40.299403","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Roosevelt"}
