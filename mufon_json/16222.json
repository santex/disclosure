{"Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting Details Witness was in her bedroom and noticed a very bright light outside. At first she thought it might be a helicopter, but it was much brighter than that. and she saw no structure, just the light. It was hovering just below the level of the treetops about two blocks away. It was less than half the diameter of the moon, almost round, but with a little of the left side cut off and a very little going down, rather like a drawing of half a stylized heart, or like the capital letter D. It was much brighter than the moon, brighter than any street light. The glow from it was wider than her outstretched hand, held at arm's length. It was not moving. She looked away for just a second, and when she looked again she couldn't see it. She went to the dining room window to see if she could see it from a different angle from there, but she couldn't. Then she heard a roar or rumble, sort of like a jet, but louder and lower in pitch, going over the apartment building. She saw it for less than a minute altogether."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16222.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16222.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.609825,+-93.606516(16222)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16222) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"16222","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Des Moines","There were no other sightings in Des Moines on or around March 13th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"03/13/2009 10:35 UTC","Latitude":"41.609825","Object Shape":"Oval","Log Number":"US-03242009-0017","City":"Des Moines","Tags":"City","Region":"Iowa","Longitude":"-93.606516","Date of the Event":"03/13/2009 10:35 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Very bright light seen through window for a minute","Disposition":"Unknown"}
