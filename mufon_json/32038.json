However, it was still bright outside and I am accustomed to the sky and I knew that they weren't stars. I contacted a friend in Austin and he verified that there were no stars north. As I traveled home i would momentarily lose sight but when I got home it appeared as if they didn't move. This took about 15 minutes so I knew they weren't planes, helicopters, or stars because it was brighter than any star I have seen and as the sun began to set the one directly north turned orange and began to disappear and the other just faded. I speculate that it was two objects reflecting the sun since the one closest to the west stayed brighter until the sun set. Me and my roommate looked at google sky and found no charted visibly bright star in that region. I always look at the sky and I can tell you that it wasn't a star, plane, or anything of the sort."],"Longitude":"-101.847446","Summary":"two bright stationary lights north of Lubbock that faded as the sun set","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","Case Number":"32038","Date of the Event":"09/23/2011 07:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Latitude":"33.581873","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"N/A"}
