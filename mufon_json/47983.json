It had a tail on it. At first I thought it may be a meteor because the tail was wobbeling. The object was bright and as it got closer to the ground the tail got smaller and smaller. Then the object stopped falling and hovered where I could barley see it over some trees. It looked red, orange. After watching it for about 7 minutes I decided to go inside."],"Sighting Duration":"00:12:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON"}
