Suddenly I noticed a bright red LED-looking pinlight straight up (SE) about 30 degrees to the left of the constellation Orion. It was between 11:45-12:15pm Dec 31 2009 (New Years Eve), which I suppose could make it suspect. It appeared as a bright red star, not moving, not twinkling, just on. It wasn't a satellite because it didn't move, it wasn't a helicopter or plane because there wasn't any sounds and it was way too high. It wasn't a firework and I'm sure it wasn't Mars, Venus or any other planet because it was much too red. I watched it for about 10-15 minutes then it seemed to dim then just disappeared. I know I wasn't seeing things because it was very bright and very cool... and I pointed it out to a bunch of people who saw it as well. I'm an avid stargazer and this is definitely the most unusual thing I had ever seen. I felt lucky to have witnessed it."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"14689","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"El Cajon","Date of the Event":"12/31/2008 11:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14689.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14689.html"],"trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in El Cajon","There were 2 other sightings in El Cajon on or around December 31st 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-01022009-0005","Longitude":"-116.967608","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"32.835225","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.835225,+-116.967608(14689)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14689) map </A>"}
