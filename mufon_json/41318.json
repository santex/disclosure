We were approaching the Dobson street exit when we noticed 3 objects hovering high in the evening sky. At first we both thought they were triangles but after viewing for a few moments we decided they were more of a teardrop shape. After looking up for about 2 minutes the three object ascended at an incredible rate of speed in unison. There was no sign on them again."]}
