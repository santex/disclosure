{"divs":["Sighting Details1 - Standing on the outside deck at 1219am2 - Just seen a strobe pulsating in 2 second intervals3 - Well it couldnt have been a plane because it was moving a hell of a lotfaster4 - I couldnt believe how Fast the object was travelling5 - I seen the Strobe pulse for the first time approx 5 miles away heading in aNorthbound direction. Im not sure of the altitude. It pulsed approx 4 times 8secondsand then was almost overhead probably 75 degrees. Then the pulse headedwestbound for 2 seconds, Then Southbound for another 8 seconds 4 strobe pulses,then eastbound for 2 seconds. Then I lost sight. We have some fighter jetsaround the area after Sept 11 there are 2 Nuke power plants approx 10 milesnorth of here. But there was no sound from this thing. The flight path frombeginning to end was a long rectangle - but it was instantaneous turning - thatswhat freaked me out. I made a drawing of the flightpath immediately after. Thereis no way this thing was a Jet Aircraft - I am very familiar with how fast theyfly and their engine sounds.6 - Object headed eastbound and the mountain blocked the view."],"City":"Congers","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.150651","Summary":"Extremely fast vehicle","Region":"New York","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Longitude":"-73.945416","Date Submitted":"07/02/2003 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.150651,+-73.945416(2393)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2393) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Congers","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"07/02/2003 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2393.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2393.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"2393","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
