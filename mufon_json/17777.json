Went in to upload photos on the computer and there i seen a strange object in one of the photos. I zoomed in on the object and it seems to be in the color of silver and saucer shaped. It had to be moving at a fast speed to cause the blur effect that is followed behind it. When outside snapping photos i did'nt see anything or hear anything at all. The object had to be at a good half mile if not more, away in the north east direction. Maybe 500 feet in the sky, if not a little more. The object seems to be above south 52 highway.
