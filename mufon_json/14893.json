The sky was absolutely clear and visability was unlimited. Standing on top of a small knoll on the high prarie I was looking due south when I noticed a bright spherical object on a low trajectory moving slowly west to east approximately 5 miles away. It was about 5 to 10 degrees above the horizon when it dropped below a small hill. I was in Air Force Tactical aircrew for 7 years an can identify most of the worlds aircraft and can tell a satelite from an aircraft. This was niether and as there was no airfields for a 100 miles in that direction I found it very disconcerting."],"Log Number":"US-01122009-0005","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
