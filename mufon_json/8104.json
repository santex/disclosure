I guesstimate its altitude between 2000-3000 feet flying much faster than the usual commercial air traffic. The craft had a grayish translucent color (like a jelly-fish), but was still clearly visible. It made absolutely no sound whatsoever. Its size in the sky was approximately 1.5-2\" held out at arm's length. The entire sighting lasted only 5-10 seconds before it was out of sight. While this was not the most impressive UFO sighting I have had--I have had several UFO sightings over the past 40+ years--this was a first for my wife who, needless to say, was very excited at having finally seen one."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Longitude":"-96.698886","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.019843,+-96.698886(8104)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8104) map </A>","Tags":"City","Summary":"Boomerang-shaped UFO over Plano, TX","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Latitude":"33.019843","Disposition":"Unknown"}
