So I film them for about 10 miles then they moved out of sight. Then I looked back in the same direction they came from and I saw the third one same speed same height moving the same direction they were all on a little different path though. Filmed that one briefly and took a digital photo. After that I did the same thing and saw the last two. I took some more video and one more digital still shot.
