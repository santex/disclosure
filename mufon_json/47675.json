He suddenly looked over my shoulder and said \"What the hell is THAT?\" The object was almost directly over us and was huge. It was a large translucent square and within the square was a very bright pulsating white light that changed to a faint glowing red and then back to white. We watched it slowly and silently float across the sky until it was out of our view due to the tree line. It moved slower than a plane. We both video taped it with our smart phones."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.297769,+-83.671094(47675)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47675) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/27/2013 03:09 UTC","City":"Rudolph","Region":"Ohio","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Large ball within a translucent square.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Rudolph","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.671094","Case Number":"47675","Date of the Event":"05/26/2013 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"41.297769"}
