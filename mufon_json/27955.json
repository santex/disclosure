{"divs":["sighting detailsi was driving the route 101 of mendoza, argentina, with 2 friends, near a town called pareditas (8 miles away), the moon was rising so we stopped to take some pictures of it. i took 4 or 5 pictures and then we get back on the road. when we arrived home, we saw a green shape almost the size of the moon, near it, in the first photograph. it was very noticeable, and with good quality, a shadow slashing the green bulbs in halfs. in all the pictures the bulb appears in different positions. we couldnt find any explanation for that, not a flearing, a reflection or object created from the human beeing could show such colors and shape, over a huge field were no one lives. i didnt contact anyone else about this, and don���t know exactly what to do as i believe my pictures are a valuable source of information to share with the world. looking forward for a response, so i can send you the photographs. photographer *(wit's name deleted--cms\\sg). san rafael, mendoza, argentina."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Log Number":"AR-02232011-0001","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"San Rafael","Date Submitted":"02/23/2011 02:14 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27955.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27955_submitter_file1__Edit1-UFOShapemoreVisible.BrightnessContrast.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27955_submitter_file3__Edit3-UFOShapeexpositionContrastBrightnessCrop.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27955.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.979465,+-122.523357(27955)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27955) map </A>","Region":"California","Summary":"Multiple Photographs of a Green Bulb with Shape Inside in Different Places at Night","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Window(s), Appendage(s)","Longitude":"-122.523357","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Sphere","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in San Rafael","There were no other sightings in San Rafael on or around May 30th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/30/2010 08:36 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"37.979465","Case Number":"27955"}
