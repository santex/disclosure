{"Summary":"ball of light floating in sky","Longitude":"-121.610312","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhen I saw the UFO, my dad, Bob, and I were driving to another friends' home to have a sushi BBQ. Then when I looked at the sky, I saw a brilliant white light floating light. Many people call me a UFO enthusiast, and say I am crazy and make up stories. But I know what I saw, and what I saw was a UFO. I screamed, \"DAD! A UFO! LOOK TO THE SKY OVER THERE!\" But he couldn't look because he was driving, and Bob was on the other side of the car. I was really exciting and afraid at the same time. Then as the car moved on, the UFO moved behind a thick cloud, and I had lost sight of it."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10069.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10069.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10069.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.865972","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Magalia","There were no other sightings in Magalia on or around February 29th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"02/29/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"Magalia","Log Number":"US-03272008-0011","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.865972,+-121.610312(10069)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10069) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Case Number":"10069","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/29/2008 12:00 UTC"}
