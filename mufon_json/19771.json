{"Summary":"Black Triangle on South Coast","trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was looking out of my Kitchen window that backs on to sea cliffs and noticed lights in sky above the house. It was dusk so the sky was dark, but not full night. The shape was clearly a triangle with two red lights at the 'base' and a white light at the apex. There was also a slow flashing central light. The other lights were continuous. I estimate that it was between five hundred and eight hundred feet high as best estimated against the roughly known height of the cliffs. It was moving too slowly for a conventional plane and was as far as I can tell, completely silent. We have a lot of air traffic over the English Channel, and sound carries considerably over the sea. It appeared to have a very smooth, very slow (relatively) flight, and I lost sight as it went over the cliffs. Also it was very clearly seen to be an almost perfect triangle. My initial reaction was that it was a conventional plane, but the sighting was long enough to clearly see that it was not 'conventional'."],"Region":"England","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-0.125435","Latitude":"51.514429","Object Features":"None","Country":"United Kingdom","City":"London","Date Submitted":"10/02/2009 04:17 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","Case Number":"19771","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.514429,+-0.125435(19771)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19771) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"GB-10022009-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19771.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19771.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Date of the Event":"Unknown"}
