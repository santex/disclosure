The first thought that came to mind was that it was a plane because of the angle of ascent. I then changed my mind because saw now flashing red light, nor did I hear any sound whatsoever. I could tell that it was not yet at a high altitude because it was against the mountain, not the sky, at first. It climbed in a south-easterly direction. When it seemed to be at a steady altitude, it changed direction, heading east. It cleared the valley in a about 15 to 20 seconds, pulsated very slowly about three times, and disappeared. To say the least, I felt a rush of excitement and confusion at the same time."],"Longitude":"-120.550671","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07062011-0011","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Bright ball of light ascended against the mountain and continued eastbound, pulsated and disappeared.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30016.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30016.html"],"Region":"Oregon","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
