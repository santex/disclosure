All if the sudden this object appeared out of no where with no tail (like a shooting star should have) and was quite brighter than anything they had seen. It went in a sharp NE direction stopped and hovered at this point my son began to take pictures with his iPhone. The object changed direction backwards. Then it hovered again for aprox 1 minute and the shot off this time leaving a u shaped cloud. My son terrified called me at work. He is 11. I told him to send me the pictured thinking it was a shooting star and I could let him know it was okay. After seeing the pictures and realizing there was no way he could have got so many pictures of a moving star I realized it may be something else. The cloud of smoke left clearly looks like it was ingaging back into space. I am (was) a non believer but these photos are sure strange."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"32.981227","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Case Number":"44548","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Haslet","Log Number":"US-12142012-0012","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.981227,+-97.338486(44548)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44548) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/14/2012 12:59 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Strange object in sky","Object Shape":"Cylinder"}
