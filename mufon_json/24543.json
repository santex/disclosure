We thought it might be the ISS,until it changed course from heading north to north east and then due east. Object was moving slower than ISS and much slower than an aircraft. We call our 9 yr old to observe. After it went from view we noticed three air craft to the south(we never have that much traffic here)I went in and checked the ISS viewing time and it was 9:32 central time. I didnt get film of it as we so manyas of late.This object was different due to the curved path it took."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"San Angelo"}
