As I was lying on my back listening to the hum of the light traffic on the highway I heard a stange noise.The noise sounded like someone was rubbing their finger on a crystal wine glass.The noise got louder,but not too loud I then opened my eyes because I knew that the sound was in the air. What I saw was a dark sky.Then all of a sudden an oval shaped light about 20-25ft across and 90ft in the air came in to my view from the NNW sky.The light moved slowly over my house changing direction twice without turning.As the light was over my house it hovered for about 4 seconds and then left my view traveling NNE. I wanted to run outside to get a better look but I was scared to move.During this 15 second ordeal I even tried to pretend I was asleep for maybe 2 seconds.I knew what I was seeing was not of this world."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8938.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8938.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/12/2007 10:08 UTC","Object Features":"None","Region":"Ontario","Log Number":"CA-01162008-0024","City":"Brampton","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.690121,+-79.757624(8938)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8938) map </A>","Case Number":"8938","Object Shape":"Blimp, Oval","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-79.757624","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Summary":"A strange noise and a oval shaped light","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"12/12/2007 10:08 UTC","Country":"Canada"}
