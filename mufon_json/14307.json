We were standing and talking when we noticed 3 objects traveling from the southwest direction heading north to south. It wasn't what we expected...there were no glowing lights and there was dead silence. Because they were not glowing or lit it is hard to tell how far away they were. They were definetly triangular or boomerang in shape. We watched for a few seconds as it faded over the tree tops. We were not overly excited but we did manage a corresponding \"Did we just see a ufo\"?. We didn't think anything of it until the rash of sightings this past summer."],"Longitude":"-75.159039","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Region":"Pennsylvania","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.954565,+-75.159039(14307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14307) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12082008-0015","Date Submitted":"02/29/2008 08:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"We saw 3 non -glowing triangle/boomerang shaped objects.","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around February 29th 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Wings"}
