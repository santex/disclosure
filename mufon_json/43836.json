It looked unusual, as I am an avid star gazer. As I got closer I noticed there were more of them (around 5) and they were moving in a line one after the other. At first I thought it was a line of helicopters but I decided to pull over to get a closer look. I rolled down my window as they went almost over me and were fairly close (maybe 200 feet off the ground). I could see them better and the light they were giving off flickered kind of like a fire but not a fire. They seemed like a fire inside some object but nothing like I've ever seen and not a Chinese lantern. I could not see any craft or anything carrying them but it was night so I'm not sure. They were just glowing orbs moving across the sky. They moved about the speed of a hang glider, maybe faster, and made no noise."],"Longitude":"-81.734807","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","City":"Naples","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43836.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43836.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/11/2012 11:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
