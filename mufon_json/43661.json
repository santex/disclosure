{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy Fiance and I were traveling home around 10pm on November 1,2012. When my fiance exclaimed, Look at the moon, when i turned around I said to him, \"babe there is no way that is the moon, if it is something is very wrong. I was a giant moon like shape in the sky setting in the east, It was vivid orange like pumpkin orange like a fireball. It lit up the entire sky in that direction witht his orange glow. It was huge. I thought maybe a astroid but that would be impossible for it to be that close to earth. By the time we had gotten out of the car it had completely set in the east behind a hill and could no longer be seen. It was amazing and has baffled me entirely. I'm still very unsure what this was."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/02/2012 10:47 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"bright orange glowing in night sky, set like sun only in east sky 3 times size of moon lit up sky with orange glow","Object Shape":"Fireball","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.523001,+-86.577137(43661)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43661) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43661.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43661.html"],"Longitude":"-86.577137","trends":[],"Region":"Tennessee","Log Number":"US-11022012-0007","Case Number":"43661","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.523001","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/01/2012 10:00 UTC"}
