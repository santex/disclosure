I had nosebleeds occurring concurrently. It flet like something was \"stuck\" up my nose, left side, and I felt the need to keep working at it. Then after a couple of days a very small object came out of my nostril and was no bigger than one-sixteenth of an inch. Very, very small it was. Upon closer inspection by me, it was a symmetrically shaped pointed object on both ends. It flet like an ivory colored piece of plastic. Below you will find a sketch of the shape of this. Remember, it was much, much smaller than the sketch. I want you to have this in case anyone else ever has the same experience and brings it to your attention so you will have collaborating story. Also, I mentioned a very round, very bright object in the low horizon in the Southwest sky visible from my Langhorne home. I had seen it in Spring 2013. It was evident last night, too."]}
