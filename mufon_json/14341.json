(i think the freeway by-passes it now)...that didn't take long and as we headed back out on the freeway leaving ceres behind...there were other cars but not too many. then, there it was...jack started yelling and pointing out his driver's sidewindow. just across the other side of the freeway, and just above the lights (still extending from ceres) was a \"banked\" oval ring of 'blue-black- lights. with windows rolled down there wasn't a sound! it was going the same speed as us...exactly the same!!! they stayed beside us for about 15 minuets. it was then that i got such a strong feeling that they could hear and understand us. i know it sounds nuts (and i remember telling jack at the time, that it might sound nuts), but i'm going to ask them if they can hear us and understand us...so, out loud i did ask them and immediatly jack was yelling againg, and as i looked over i saw it blink out it's lights and you could see it give us an answer by showing us the bottom side. it was diamond shapped with lights 'pulsating' a cluster of different colored lights in the center and several at each corner. it stayed that way for about (i'd estimate just a few minuets) then it gently went back to the 'ring' of blue-black lights..still going the same speed as us. about this time i looked out my side of the car and there was a second one...i'd estimate about the same distance away as the other one. as i recall the banked ring of lights. we went along for a while like that and i noticed by there were no freeway lights and no traffic. suddenly there was a third ship down in front of us...above the highway about 30-40 feet i think. it was about 1\\2 of a block away, but we could see that it was lit-up inside with a soft glow like and there was a pannel in the background middle of the ship. it had a lot of lights that changed patterns. there were about 7-8 figures standing in the windows looking at us. they moved around a little, but not very much. they really seemed intent on us. jack was spooked by this time and had stopped the car (in the fast lane). we sat there for a few minuets when i relalized we'd better move or get off the highway...jack started the car and all three that had stopped when we did, began moving right along with us again. then, i heard a loud roar....as i looked back i saw a big semi truck barraling down on us...as i looked out my window, i saw the driver smile and wave as he 'flew'by....as though nothing had happened...but it was close! that has always remained strange to me. when i asked jack to get off the freeway so maybe we could get a better look...he did get off but i think he was scared, but i was totally ok...i was never felt afraid. so back on the freeway we went and them with us...then, one by one they 'zipped' off into the night sky and then blinked off. we got home with about 1\\3 tank of gas. we had gassed up in sacramento...that's not possable in the el camano we were driving...also there no way you can drive (even over the limit sometimes), from seattle to la in 18 hours. wer left seattle at 8am and got to my front door at about 2:00am in the morning. northern and middle california have some long lonely streches...at least it did then. there's so much more to this...like the things leading up to the event itslf that day...other sightings very, very near to us at that moment on the morning news...near sea-tac airport, as we were leaving south seattle. we started looking...at least i was. jack is a pretty down to earth guy litterly. where i'm curious about everything."],"Case Number":"14341","Latitude":"37.59112","City":"Ceres","Object Shape":"Diamond, Oval","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Window(s)","Disposition":"Hoax","Log Number":"US-12102008-0013","Summary":"Surrounded by 3, silent ships.
