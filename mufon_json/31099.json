It started having trouble with the reception when a helicopter loudly passed overhead. I ran outside to look, since it is unusual for one to pass so low at such a late hour, although we are not all that far from Dulles Airport, and see them occasionally during the day, or before 9 pm. I saw a large,round brilliant, unwaveringly bright white light, closely followed by the helicopter, which had blinking red and white lights, seen from my angle of vision. They were heading east, in a straight-line path. The helicopter was following closely; the object was larger than the helicopter, but made no discernable noise. The helicopter was quite close to the object and obviously tailing it. I watched it until it flew out of sight, over the distant tree line. I've seen helicopters at night before; even tandem pairs, but never one following another, obviously different type of aircraft so closely."],"Summary":"Brilliant round white light, larger than the following helicopter"}
