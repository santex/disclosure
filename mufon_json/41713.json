Living outside Phila.,Pa. I am located near the Sciota area and view the same sky. I have observed these \"false stars\" pump out hundreds of orbs nightly from the right side and retrieve them from the left. Often the primary craft will noticeably move up,down, and to the side to assist the returning orbs. The primary craft (mothership)oftens moves slightly as aircraft fly beneath but in the general area. I am currently looking for a larger telescope to take photos or video of the primary craft. I believe we may be observing the same object. Try to locate the orbs with the naked eye."],"Date Submitted":"08/13/2012 03:53 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.188875","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Information regarding sighting at Sciota, Pa. on 8/12/12 northeastern U.S.","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"02:15:00"}
