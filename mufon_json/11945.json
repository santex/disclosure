It was almost a full moon and I was looking up at the night sky. I was looking below the moon and saw a cloud there. I looked back at the moon and out of my perifrial vision I noticed a light that I thought was a cloud below the moon. Then I noticed a boomerang shaped object. The object moved in different directions. It moved towards the open end of the V which didn't seem to make sense aerodynamically. Within approx 15 seconds it went off into another cloud. I was in disbelief after I saw the object and went back into the house. The next day, I shared with my family and friends what I saw. A week later somebody told me that there was an article in the paper stating that other people in the area saw the shape object that I saw. It was affirming to know that other people also saw something that night."],"Summary":"I saw a bomerang shaped object below the moon","Source":"MUFON"}
