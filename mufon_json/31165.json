{"divs":["Sighting Detailsthe street light in the background is aprox 150 feet away and 60 feet tall as a reference. Not sure exactly what I caught in the picture bu it made no sound. Maybe you can determine what the the objects are..I was only able to get 2 pictures then they seem to just disappeared..I took these pictures tens days before the raid on binladen compound - maybe it was the stealth helocopters? The objects where traveling from the north on a southward flight path much faster than any plane - if they continued going south they would have enter Redstone Asenals air space which is less than a mile south of me. Maybe you can determine what they are."],"Summary":"What can I say - other than look at the 2 pictures","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08252011-0020","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.636073","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Huntsville","There were no other sightings in Huntsville on or around","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31165.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31165_submitter_file1__IM003056.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31165_submitter_file2__IM003057.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31165.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.715468","Region":"Alabama","City":"Huntsville","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.715468,+-86.636073(31165)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31165) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/25/2011 09:50 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"31165","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
