At first I thought it was just the headlight of an airplane, but as it went overhead it still remained bright and had no strobes. It made no sound and was too low to be a satellite. As it continued to travel to the east it faded to a dim red speck of light and disappeared."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11905.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11905.html"]}
