The first thing i thought was it was a UFO, because im into all that stuff, and conspiracies, things like that. And my friend said it was probably a bug and i said no, because it was too high up and far away, it looks more like an object, or something flying, it also reminded me of those dementors from harry potter. Soo i dont know anything about it, i have seen UFOs with my eyes recently and also in the ast but i have never caught one on camera on accident."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Corpus Christi","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/23/2013 02:16 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/17/2012 07:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"49134","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.389881","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.809593,+-97.389881(49134)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49134) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"I was at a concert with friends. took a picture of friends face as joke.
