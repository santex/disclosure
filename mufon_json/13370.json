{"Log Number":"US-10292008-0031","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend Sam is, for lack of a better term, a computer tard and every Wednesday we get together to have dinner and catch up on the previous weeks events. He brought over his digital camera and asked me if I could transfer his photos to a CD. As we went through the pics, I noticed this photo (see attached) that had a strange object in it. As I zoomed in the hair on the back of my neck stood up. He had captured a UFO. Then he started to tell me about an abduction his mother and him had encountered some 25 years ago. I have known Sam for years and he has never spoken of such things until this photo. The picture was taken on FT. Lewis Army base. He also has several other photos ( I will be posting here in the near future) that have UFOs in them."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Olympia","There was one other sighting in Olympia on or around June 23rd 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/23/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"06/23/2008 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"08:08:00","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"47.040904","Longitude":"-122.893735","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13370.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13370_submitter_file1__P6230103.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13370.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.040904,+-122.893735(13370)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13370) map </A>","Region":"Washington","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Olympia","Summary":"UFO near Ft.
