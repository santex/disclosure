It was about the size of a dime when held at arms length. The object was setting perfectly still, I told my cousin about it but he could not see it because he was under a deck umbrella, I went into the house to get a camera which was just off where we were and when I got back on the deck (30 seconds)the object had disapeared. I am very convinced that there are other intellegnt alleans watching us."]}
