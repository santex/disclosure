I was just about to a big curve in the road, when I saw what were like very bright beams of light coming from the south as I came threw the turn I could see the bright light beams cutting though the dark night. sky, I slow my south bound travel down to see what it was as it was getting close to me coming from the South in a North, North West track I could see where these bright light were come from It was from an large rectangle object with two rows of 4 lights the brightest I���ve ever seen. At first I thought maybe they where helicopters searching for drugs but then quickly said no the lights would be shining downwards and the wouldn���t have been so uniformed this lights look like they were solidly attached To something huge like a large rectangle as this object drifted toward me and I was getting closer to it, I could believe what I was seeing I thought of my friend a MUFON Member and said I don���t carry what time it is I calling him. I did and woke him up as I talked to him and explained and asked him what the heck this thing is. I creped up to a stop sign on Mat lock rd. and Hwy 242 where I stopped and just watched as this object floated closer and closer and I was telling my friend what I was seeing I told him I was getting out of here and hung up. But I stayed there at the stop sign to watch it a little longer , I had no camera , I had both widows down on my truck the there were no sounds it was eerily quite it moved passed me I bent over and look out the passenger side window at this point I could see only the top and bottom lights on the corner closest to me and the beams cast a light way out in front of it, as I watched it float by I could see the dark outline of something massive behind the light at this point I had a fear come over me and immediately hit the gas and never looked back. I wanted to but just couldn���t do it."],"City":"Bowling Green","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/24/2008 01:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12223.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12223.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.99813,+-86.433642(12223)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12223) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/24/2008 01:15 UTC","Tags":"City"}
