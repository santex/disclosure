I was using a Nikon D7000 with a 18-105mm lens on a tripod. The exposures ranged from 3 to 15 sec at f11 with an ISO of 6400. In the 62 seconds that the event was observed, I shot 6 exposures. I didn't notice anything by my eye or in the viewfinder but later, when I downloaded the pictures into Adobe Lightroom, I saw a blue nebulosity below and to the left of Venus. In each subsequent photo, it moved up and to the right against the star field. I doubt it was a lens artifact as the camera didn't move and I took pictures of Orion shortly thereafter with no problems. The sequence of photos were taken over 1 minute and 2 seconds from 2042:10 to 2043:12. Like I said I didn't see anything with the naked eye but the camera caught it at 6400 ISO. I was using a remote cable release to trip the shutter and did not see any aircraft pass during that time period. When I saw the photos on the computer, I was mystified and excited. I've seen unknown objects before but this was the first time I've documented any, albeit unknowingly."],"Longitude":"-73.844619","Date Submitted":"04/03/2012 12:25 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Oval","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New York","Date of the Event":"04/02/2012 08:43 UTC","Case Number":"37097"}
