I was downloading a program and smoking a cigarette at the same time. I sat back in my chair and when I looked up I saw 4 bright orange lights but they all lit up one by one. I stood up to knock on the balcony door to alert my brothers while looks at the objects the entire time and they started to go off same way they came on, one by one. About 15-20mins later at 10:00pm - 10:05pm I heard loud engine noise in the sky over the ocean that sounded like aircraft. I continued to hear them for another 10 mins until I saw two small but loud aircraft flying torwards the part of the ocean front where I saw the orange ufo's. They turned and started flying back where they came from but went off in formation inland over the city. It's now 10:19pm and you can still hear them off and on."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/12/2011 09:40 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.820876,+-78.677176(29071)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29071) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29071.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29071.html"],"Case Number":"29071","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"South Carolina","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in North Myrtle Beach","There were no other sightings in North Myrtle Beach on or around May 12th 2011"],"City":"North Myrtle Beach","Log Number":"US-05122011-0009","Date Submitted":"05/12/2011 10:19 UTC","Summary":"four bright lights in circle shapes and orange in color","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Circle"}
