I had just walked to the entrance, I was standing just to the right of the Mookini Heiau sign. Photos previous and post, within a few seconds show nothing out of the ordinary. I thought it may be dirt but why would the previous and post photos have no sign of lense dirt. Camera was brand spankin new outta the box. I never saw the object. It looks spherical and is lighter on top than on the bottom. The walls to the right are about 10 feet tall if not taller."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.900086,+-155.573322(3794)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3794) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/31/2005 02:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON"}
