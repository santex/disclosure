While I was waiting for the dogs to finish I looked up and saw an object with a disc shape turned on its side with cones sticking out of both sides. The disc was an oval shape and was not moving but the cones appeared to be spinning like a mad chicken. I had watched it for about five mintues when one of the dogs barked and I figured I should take them in and get the camera. When I came back out the object was still there and that's when I relized it could not have been a side affect of the bowl of mary J I had smoked early. So I adjusted my camera and when I looked back up it had faded away right where it was in a matter of 3 to 5 seconds. After it was over I could not decided if I had really seen that or if it was my mind playing tricks on me and when I talked to my good friend Lee. So he convinced me to report this."]}
