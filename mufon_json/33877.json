I smoke outside becaues i rent and cannot smoke in the house. When i stepped out my front door i noticed about 20-30 dull lights streaking across the sky over me.They were dull yellow orange in color and as some of them kept a steady flight straight across the sky while others that were with them would stop for a second and some would pass them and then they would streak away with the rest.They left no trails when they flew and there was no sound but they sure did look like a well organized FLEET of craft.I know what i saw."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"I walked out my front door early this morning to about 20 or more rectangular lights flying straight across the sky stopping some of them while others just kept going.","Tags":"City"}
