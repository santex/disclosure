{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas driving east bound on hiway 10 between the towns of Alton Iowa and Granville when I suddenly saw 7 white lights hovering about 35 degrees off of the horizon. I watched for no more then 10 seconds and they faded one by one. I took out my cell phone to record them if they came back on but nothing. After this report I am going outside to scan the sky again with my cell phone hoping to capture what i saw so i can share with anyone interested."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33368.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33368.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/15/2011 05:22 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.982029,+-95.865609(33368)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33368) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Granville","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.865609","Log Number":"US-11152011-0015","Case Number":"33368","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Granville","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Summary":"seen about 7 lights hovering and as soon as i seen them they slowly disappeared","Latitude":"42.982029","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/15/2011 06:54 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"Iowa"}
