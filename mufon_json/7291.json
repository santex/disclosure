It had 3 lights, and absolutely no noise. The exact location of Shelton Elementary school and Cedercrest Rd. We stopped in the middle of the road, because it was unlike anything we've ever seen. We watched it for about 30 seconds and rolled the windows down in the car. No Noise, no movement from the craft. The situation was odd and we decided to leave promptly because we were nearly(70yrds away) directly under it. I regret not taking photos, but I didn't have a camera."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/28/2001 10:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Acworth","There were no other sightings in Acworth on or around February 28th 2001"],"Latitude":"34.065933","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.065933,+-84.67688(7291)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7291) map </A>","Summary":"Black Triangle hovering 20 feet over treetops","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"02/28/2001 10:00 UTC","City":"Acworth","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06222007-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
