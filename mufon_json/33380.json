I saw a giant craft that had 6 large rectangle panels on the back end, that were glowing blue white, like plasma engines. It reminded me of the ���Millennium Falcon\" from the Star Wars movies. What first caught my eye was a sparking or flash on the bottom of the craft, as it moved over my car. Then I saw two rows of 3 large rectangles, of blue white glowing lights. Each rectangle appeared to be house size. They appeared to be at the rear of the craft as it moved away from me. It was amazing how big this looked to me, I said out loud to my self, \"I hope its one of ours\". It looked like it was about 1000 feet up above me. After looking through my gas and food receipts I was able to pin down the actual time of my sighting, at 8PM, just one mile east of 970 S Blake Ranch Rd, Kingman, AZ 86401-4546 on the I40. I was driving almost due West on I40 toward Kingman AZ. I had just passed US93 when I saw the electrical sparks through my windshield to my right. It was flying along very slow for a jet and it had a ball of light traveling below it near the ground at the same rate of speed. You can see the ball in the first few frames of the video, but it might be a reflection. I fumbled for my video camera while driving, that took me about 20 to 30 seconds. At the beginning of the taping I passed a freeway sign, \"Blake Ranch Rd. Exit 1 mile\". I recorded until just after I pass the exit, the craft was to far away, maybe 4 or 5 miles. It would have passed over or near the Kingman Airport. Someone should check with them. There were car lights behind me about a mile or two, I don't know if they saw anything. When I played the tape later in Needles at a gas stop, the cameras time code showed I had traveled one mile in 32 seconds! No freaking way, I would have had to be going over 100MPH. I was going tops 70-75 and my car was packed full of stuff, I was moving to CA. I tested the camera and nothing wrong there. I had a time shift or something? I posted the video on YouTube, but its just shaky lights due to being hand held. I have worked on the video and tried to stabilize the lights the best I can. It was far away by the time I got my camera out so you can't see the size the way I did. I believe this craft was heading toward Area 51, after researching the angle of the flight and the city lights relative to its direction. I plotted a straight line from my sighting to the base and its direction of travel. I think its one of ours! I also contacted a company that is building Plasma Engines for NASA and asked them if they had anything that big up and flying around yet. I got no reply. I wrote them again and gave a description and let them know that they must have some competition out there. 35���10'19.72\"N 113���46'36.53\"W elevation 4213Ft Google Earth"],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33380.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33380.html"],"Object Features":"Other","Longitude":"-114.045876","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"35.198843","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Kingman","There were no other sightings in Kingman on or around November 21st 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"11/16/2011 04:55 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"11/21/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
