{"Country":"United States","City":"Mechanicville","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in the second floor and the two basketball shape lights were so bright that illuminated about 200 ft the wooded area and when I wanted to see what it was they opened the blind shades one by one to see me in my bed, for some reason I couldn't move but I knew it was not from this world. I saw a cloud almost invisible at the beginning but then the shape appeared to be a woman like figure with big eyes, I didn't look the eyes and told her to leave me alone and that I couldn't have children any more and didn't want anything with them. But this was very terrifying experience because I couldn't move to run away, then as soon as they left couldn't sleep for weeks, I feel they will come back again no matter where. I always see UFOs in the sky but I do not port a video camera with me right now. The characteristic is that the lights were amazingly powerful in the dark woods but when observing me the light did not get to the room plus I was with the bathroom light on, but that night I was awake in pain so impossible I had a dream."],"Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Log Number":"US-08052013-0035","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mechanicville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"08/05/2013 09:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"49509","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-73.68734","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Two lights over my second window and got Paralyzed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49509.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49509.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"42.902855","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/12/2006 02:20 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.902855,+-73.68734(49509)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49509) map </A>"}
