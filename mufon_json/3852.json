I was looking at the stars and when I was staring at the stars I saw something which looked like a star but was moving and was brighter than the stars. It was just moving slowly in the nightsky heading north. First I thought it was a plane because I saw many other planes that night but they all have blinking lights and are far different than the object and less high, the object was just a solid bright light, I looked at it for maybe 15 minutes until I couldn't see it anymore it was too far away. My reaction was that I couldn't believe my eyes, but I still wonder if it wasn't a falling star, but falling stars go downwards, this object did not it just went north."],"Longitude":"4.497586","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.161922,+4.497586(3852)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3852) map </A>","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"NL-09142005-0004","Case Number":"3852","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"The Netherlands","City":"Leiden","Region":"Zuid-Holland","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Leiden","There were no other sightings in Leiden on or around"],"Summary":"I saw a bright light crossing the night sky!","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"52.161922","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/14/2005 03:40 UTC"}
