As looked up to the east I noticed what looked like a commercial plane. It was different though...no wings. It was a cigar shape. It just sat there from the whole duration from when I turned onto that road from M-47. It took me around 15 minutes because traffic was very busy that particual day. I am very into aviation and I know the difference from a plane and what I saw. After a while I had to watch the road because I was getting into the city...I lost sight of it."],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Saginaw","There were no other sightings in Saginaw on or around May 31st 1994"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar","Latitude":"43.42655","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"17074","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
