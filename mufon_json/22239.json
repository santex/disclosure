From our driveway, I noticed my son, his friend and his friend's mom and dad looking at the sky pointing at something. I looked up and saw a ball of light silently and smoothly cruising from the east in a straight line, then slowly started turning north until it finally disappeared. (at least about a minute long or more, and it disappeared from view behind trees but a long way off) I thought at first maybe it was a really bright aircraft up pretty high, but quickly dismissed that idea... (living near Hartsfield Jackson Int. Airport, we're used to constant air traffic overhead our neighborhood, and I know what that looks like)."],"City":"Senoia","Date Submitted":"03/09/2010 11:49 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-84.544016","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.303871","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Senoia","There were no other sightings in Senoia on or around March 6th 2010"],"Summary":"ball of light (white), bright from all angles, no blinking lights, silent","Date of the Event":"03/06/2010 05:30 UTC"}
