As we were leaving a man came in telling everyone there were UFO's in the sky. I joked with the hostess to no believe him. He insisted there were ufo's. We decided to go see for ourself. And sure enough as we drove to the walmart a little further down the road we saw three lights in the sky at first we thought it was cell phone tower lights. Then as we got closer we noticed they were free floating, pulsing like a star in the sky over the walmart on 192. People were standing around looking at it. Then helicopters came in and they just disappeared."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.298496,+-81.400931(33278)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33278) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/11/2011 09:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-11112011-0013","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"28.298496","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/11/2011 10:33 UTC","Case Number":"33278","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Kissimmee","There were no other sightings in Kissimmee on or around November 11th 2011"],"Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Saw three star like ufo in the sky.
