{"divs":["sighting detailsboyfriend and i were sitting on roof of parents house watching neighbors firework show about 11pm on the 4th. i had the binoculars and looked behind us to see if anyone else had fireworks going off. i saw the first red orange orb and didn't really compute in my head that it was rather large. about a minute later i looked again and saw the second one going same speed and direction. they were flying north. i nudged my boyfriend and we watched the 2nd one until it went behind the lone tree in the field across the road from us. we waited for it to come out from the other side of the tree and it never did. when i looked at it w\\the binoculars it looked transparent with the middle being a bright red light and fading out to outline the shape of it. i would compare it to a chinese lantern but very large and silent. too fast for a hotair balloon but about the same size i'd say."],"Date Submitted":"07/06/2012 04:36 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40302.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40302.html"],"Longitude":"-122.935778","City":"Winlock","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 12:00 UTC","Summary":"chinese lantern lookin 2 bout 3 min apart same speed & direction. red","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"40302","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"46.501108","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Winlock","There were no other sightings in Winlock on or around July 4th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Washington","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.501108,+-122.935778(40302)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40302) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07062012-0017"}
