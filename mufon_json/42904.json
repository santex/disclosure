Girls ran indoors to get myself, my father and brother. We all saw the 4 lighted objects moving thru the sky, too high to be planes or any other helicopter. Lights were pulsating across the bottom of the aircraft. My father who worked for an aircraft company knows that this was not an airplane."],"City":"Maineville","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Maineville","There were no other sightings in Maineville on or around September 29th 2012"],"Latitude":"39.321203","Longitude":"-84.198004","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"42904","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"4 lights traveling at a very high, higher than planes travel, slowly moving","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42904.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42904.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/29/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.321203,+-84.198004(42904)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42904) map </A>"}
