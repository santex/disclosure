Stopped at a red light, she observed a HUGE oval-shaped craft over the four lane highway, skimming over the top of the trees, heading north. The craft had windows in which she could see someone inside. The craft was as big as a football field. She could hear a sound like a motor that went boom-boom-boom. She felt the craft was in trouble. She saw this for about 10 minutes. She said she called the police and the newspaper, but no one called her back."],"Region":"New York","trends":["There has been one other sighting in East Norwich","There were no other sightings in East Norwich on or around July 31st 1988"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-12282009-0018","Object Shape":"Oval","Longitude":"-73.535124","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.846766,+-73.535124(21219)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21219) map </A>","Object Features":"Window(s)","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21219.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21219.html"],"Summary":"Huge craft seen skimming trees with someone inside.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/31/1988 07:15 UTC","City":"East Norwich","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"12/28/2009 02:50 UTC","Latitude":"40.846766"}
