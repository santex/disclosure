At first I thought it might be military flare but it was moving at constant speed and altitude and then suddenly changed direction 90 degrees to orginal flight path and then suddenly sped away into cloud cover at very high rate of speed. Much brighter than either an aircraft landing light or a typical military flare, both of which I am quite familiar with. It disappeared into the cloud front and then suddenly the light went out. I've lived here for 12 years and I've seen lots of military flares and aircraft landing lights, but I have never seen anything even remotely like this. It was not an aircraft landing light, flare, or anything like that."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38488.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38488.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-82.261922","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.926259,+-82.261922(38488)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38488) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/23/2012 08:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-05242012-0019","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Brandon","There was one other sighting in Brandon on or around May 23rd 2012"],"Tags":"City"}
