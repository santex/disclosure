Plane flying west was at a higher altitude than playing flying northeast( and was probably commercial aircraft flying towards D.I.A.) After planes had flow out of sight range, a small white cylindrical object at high speeds with, no noise flew in-between the apparent flightpath and altitudes of prior aircraft; at a westerly direction. Object at first appeared to have wing structure, but after observing for a minute or so; it was obvious it did not. Object either was at a very high altitude or indeed was very small in structure. Object appeared to be \"meteoritic\" at first but did not burn up, nor did it produce any short of tail , associated with a \"shooting star.\""],"trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Littleton","There were no other sightings in Littleton on or around January 4th 2013"]}
