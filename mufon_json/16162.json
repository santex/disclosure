I noticed a object close to Polaris and thought it may be a airplane because it was moving. I looked for the I.D. and strobe lights that are on all aircraft and could not see any. Then it became very bright. It was brighter than the landing lights on any aircraft I have ever seen. I'm former Air Force and know what landing lights look like. After a few moments it started to dim to a reddish color before it faded out of sight. From my perspective it seemed to be heading towards the northwest but more north than west. I was so amazed by it that all I could do is watch. I couldn't even tell my girlfriend who was inside not 10 feet away."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States"}
