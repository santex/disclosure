{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThese are photographs taken by my wife's friend taken in Northern Oregon I believe. She is not a big believer in UFOligy but I am, and when I saw the photographs I asked if I could have them. My wife got them from her friend for me. To me it looks like a fleet flying in formation and are cloaked in clouds. I want to know if there have been other reports such as this, and if it is a known technology possesed by the ETI's (ability to create and memic movement of clouds as a disquise) or if this is more commonly known to be used by the ARV's? Or is this just a phenomenon recorded and understood as a cloud formation in our atmosphere to date? I appreciate any feedback or speculation you may have."],"City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/26/2011 03:20 UTC","Summary":"V shaped fleet with two craft bringing up the tail flying in formation, but cloaked in clouds?","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.810083,+-120.550581(30354)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30354) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30354.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30354_submitter_file1__UFOCLOUDS3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30354_submitter_file2__UFOCLOUDS4.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30354_submitter_file3__UFOCLOUD5.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30354.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Oval","Region":"Oregon","Case Number":"30354","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"None","trends":[""],"Longitude":"-120.550581","Latitude":"43.810083","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07262011-0010","Date of the Event":"05/05/2011 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
