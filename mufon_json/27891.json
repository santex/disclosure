He called my attention to two fast moving objects in the sky by the full moon. One was a very bright white leaving a contrail behind. The other was a red light that seemed dimmer but left no contrail. The red one seemed to change course at a high rate of speed and the two flew by each other very closley. I have never seeen things move so fast or glow so bright. This happened over the couse of about 45 seconds to a minute or so."],"Latitude":"39.760468","Longitude":"-94.831969","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"St Joseph"}
