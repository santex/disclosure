In front of me were 2 large apartment buildings that are probably about 15 stories high that perimeter the parking lot. It was a clear blue sunny day. Above the one building on the north side, I saw a saucer shaped object with what looked like a red circle underneath it.At first I thought it was a plane but it just hovered over the bulding maybe 30feet above it. This object was very low. It wasnt moving it was just hovering over the buidling. I told my friend to look up and look as I pointed up. As I did that the object moved to the building next to it to the south and just disappered into thin air in front of me. The object made no noise. Had no lights, windows, markings except for faint red belly. Did not reflect even though it was sunny."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"classic saucer shaped silver metal disc with faint red middle hovering over highrise building","Log Number":"US-03192008-0004","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/13/2008 11:50 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/13/2008 11:50 UTC","Case Number":"9975","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around March 13th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Chicago","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9975.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9975.html"],"Longitude":"-87.628218"}
