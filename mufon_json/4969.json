{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were outside in the driveway talking and I was looking up at the neighbor's roof line. I noticed two yellow-orange lights that seemed to be too low for a plane. Then one disappeared and then the other. It was quick, but seemed like it was slow-motion when I was watching it. They just floated there and there was no sounds. After they were gone, I told my fiance about it (he has seen them once in May) and he said \"See now you know what we were talking about\" I have two other friends that have seen these lights as well. It was the strangest thing."],"Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Lafayette","There were no other sightings in Lafayette on or around June 20th 2006"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.418432,+-86.868487(4969)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4969) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/20/2006 10:33 UTC","Summary":"Two yellow-orange lights in eastern sky and then disappeared","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4969.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4969.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/20/2006 10:33 UTC","Longitude":"-86.868487","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"4969","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06202006-0005","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"40.418432","City":"Lafayette","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
