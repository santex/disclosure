Stopped at stop sign, saw bright blue object flash from left to right across the sky infront of us. Was above the mountains, so it wasn't terribly near, but close enough to see. It didn't go in a curve or downwards as if it was falling. Came out of blank sky, went in a perfectly straight line, left to right then dissapeared. I sat there and stared at it a moment then asked the other passenger if they saw it, she did too. We both stared around for a minute but saw nothing else."],"trends":[],"Date of the Event":"01/11/2010 06:02 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"21439","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21439.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21439.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/11/2010 01:40 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-01112010-0007","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
