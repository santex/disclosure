Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","divs":["sighting detailsthis took place on 11\\18\\08 between 18:00-18:30.it was just after dark and i was standing on my front porch smoking a cigarette. i was standing in the middle of my front porch entry way between two trees that i have planted on both sides. i normally stand in spot this so that the street light posted near my residence does not shine directly into my eyes. what i usually do is just look at the sky and watch the stars. well on this evening, a bright orbe\\sphere looking object flew over my house from the south and was headed north. as i noticed the bright sphere object, i could not help that notice that it appeared to be moving very fast, but made no sound. at first, i thought i needed to watch this thing,just to see if what i was seeing was real. i then turned and opened my front door and yelled for my wife. this took maybe 5-8 seconds for her to come running down the stairs. as she made it outside to where i was standing, we continued to watch the object that still appeared to be traveling at the same speed. what really caught my attention was the fact that it appeared to be at an elevation of i will guestimate between 5000-7000 ft. as i watched it, i knew that it could not have been jetplane,helicopter,ect..due to the fact that i am also a pilot and i did not hear any sound at all coming from this object. i knew it was no falling star or meteorite, due to the fact that they fall very fast and last only a second or more. i have never seen any thing fly this great length of distance, move that fast and not make any noise at all, especially at the altitude i am estimating it to have been traveling at.the object was a bright,round sphere like object that had the appearance of a bright star. it seemed to just glide across the sky and as it got further away, it went into a small clump of low flying clouds in the distance. as the sphere went into the clouds, the light slowly faded and was just gone. the spheres trajectory did, however, seem to angle just a bit kinda like a a whinding down curve in the sky.my reactions were what the hell was that i just saw, what could fly like that,at that speed and make no sound,yet still seem to just glide across the sky with ease. i did feel concerned,due to the fact that i am also a police ofc. and wanted to call and report the sighting,but did not want to be called crazy. i then initialy, wanted to call the mcallen int. airport and ask them if anyone had reported seeing anything on radar, due to the fact that there is a steady amount of commercial air traffic inbound from san antonio,houston,ect. in fact, there was a commercial airliner that did come into the airspace here in the same area that i saw the object,maybe 5-10 mins afterwards.but it was south bound, where as the object was flying northbound.we do own a digital camera that is capable of filming video clips and to be honest i did not think i would make it inside and back outside in time to catch this thing on film,due to how fast it seemed to fly. i will admit that i was excited and felt uneasy at the same time.i was basically in awe that what i was actually seeing could be what we all want to believe exist and that is \"ufo's\". after i witnessed this thing, i did run back inside my house after i was sure the sighting was over and turned on my police radio to see if anyone else in the city was calling my police dept. to report any unusual sightings in the sky. after i listened for a short while, it then dawned on me that maybe noone else saw it and if they did maybe they were as dumbfounded as i was an felt stupid to call and report it. this has been bothering me since it occurred for the simple fact that i can not come up with any reasonable explanation as to what it was. i am not looking to get famous or anything like that, but if you guys do research this in anyway, shape or form please try and contact the mcallen airport communications tower and try to obtain any radio chatter from pilot to pilot, pilot to ground or vise versa in regards to anything that was reported to them or by them and also see if you can review the radar recordings as well. i would just really like an educated explanation in to what it was that i witnessed. i enjoy flying and am somewhat afraid to go public or contact the f.a.a. due to the fact that i like being a pilot an want to keep my license.i also realize that i have no physical evidence and the only person that can cooberate my story is my wife."],"map":"<A HREF =
