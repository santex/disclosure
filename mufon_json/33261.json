She told me that it was about the size of a penny. So I looked and there was nothing until a small whitish-blue light appeared. This light was about the size of a bright planet. It disappeared and reappeared several times within the same small area of the sky, but in random places. It appeared to be staying close to the thin, dark edge of the cloud moving just below it. There were no clouds covering it. All of this took place during ten minutes. We both saw this happen and I recorded it on my cell phone. The light was too small to be seen on my phone's video but I will include it as a frame of reference."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33261.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33261.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/10/2011 08:36 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-88.34614","Latitude":"41.692717","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Oswego","There were no other sightings in Oswego on or around November 10th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like","City":"Oswego","Summary":"Large bright flash of light, disappeard and reappeared as smaller light","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11102011-0013","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.692717,+-88.34614(33261)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33261) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"N/A"}
