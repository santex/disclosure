I am about 3 miles from home. As I was driving down the main street I notice three lights in the sky. The sky is typical heavy traffic area for planes heading to the St. Louis Airport, which is approximately 27 miles east of this occurrence. What caught my eye was these lights were spread apart quite a bit, but consistent in distance. They were in a straight line and blinking in sequential order (1-2-3, etc.) I thought that perhaps that what I was seeing was a tower of some sort that I didn���t notice before because it would be abnormal to see places flying in this formation. Plus, these planes were not headed towards the airport, nor were they, from my position; coming from the direction of the main airport. That���s why I thought they could be tower lights that warn low flying planes at night. But, that was not the case. As I continued down the main road (which is a busy road) I stretched to see them out my front and passenger window. I don���t ever recall seeing lights like this as a steady fixture, so I was trying to think of what it could be. Once I lost sight of the lights, since they were in my blind spot, I continued on and entered into my neighborhood. Once I am in my neighborhood I have to back track to get to my home. That���s when I saw the lights again. It was clear that it was not a tower as they appeared to be moving west. I ran in the house, asked my husband to go outside in the back yard and tell me what that is in the sky. I didn���t even turn off my car or park it in the garage as I wanted him to see this and explain what it was that I was seeing before it was out of our sight line. He is a 23-year military veteran and very familiar with various military air craft. Looking through the bare trees in our yard, he said he didn���t know, but was sure that military planes wouldn���t fly in such as straight line with lights that blinked sequentially. I went in and grabbed the camera and went out front of the house to see if I could get a better view. A house was blocking the view, so we got in the car. We figured we could get to an open space and at least be able to get a better view. Both of us thought to head west as that���s where it seem to be going towards, and we were going down a road that had a wide open view of the sky. We should have at least been able to see the object in the distance, but we drove a few miles and saw nothing but the normal air traffic that is common."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"21008","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"O'Fallon","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in O'Fallon","There were no other sightings in O'Fallon on or around December 15th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
