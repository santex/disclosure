{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting Detailswhile waiting with four other students for the bus at the bus stop, we noticed a slow moving green star. It was moving one direction overhead. We thought it might be a satalite and were discussing wether or not it was when it switched directions moving faster back the way it came. We watched in aw as it turned again and zoomed off out of sight. There was no sound no flashing lights it stayed a constant bright star size and green. We spent all day excited and talking about it in school. i have never seen anything like it!"],"Country":"United States","City":"Salina","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Salina","There were no other sightings in Salina on or around September 21st 2012"],"Log Number":"US-09262012-0006","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Kansas","Summary":"My 12year old son and four others saw green light while waiting for a bus","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42827.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42827.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/26/2012 06:41 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Fireball","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-97.607704","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.84378,+-97.607704(42827)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42827) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/21/2012 06:30 UTC","Latitude":"38.84378","Case Number":"42827"}
