It was 7pm...took pics, attmepted to take video, however it did not come out clear at all ...later when we looked at pictures we saw a orb like object within the picture, in addition we saw a bright boomerang shape light reflecting off the lamp post . Thinking it was just a reflection from the lamp post, we ignored it. But then when I downloaded the picture and pulled it up, we saw the same shape in the clouds above the light below. When I went onto Mufon the next day , I saw that someone had seen boomerang lighted object in burbank the same day...so perhaps this was what he saw. Ironically the boomerang object has one flat end and one rounded end just like the guy who reported it that same day."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"43271","Longitude":"-118.749378","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43271.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43271_submitter_file1__picone.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43271_submitter_file2__2012100519.04.03.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/43271_submitter_file3__2012100519.04.031.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43271.html"],"Log Number":"US-10152012-0014","City":"Oak Park","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.179737,+-118.749378(43271)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43271) map </A>","Summary":"saw tube like mist coming down from cloud/ later orb in pics/ strange boomerang light in cloud","Latitude":"34.179737"}
