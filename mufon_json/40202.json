I watched it for about 3 minutes and then it disappeared. The light pulsed at time but never blinked and no other lights were observed at the time. The color was similar to an object I saw in January of this year however it was stationary over a shopping plaza , it was smaller and slowly disappeared after about 2 minutes of watching it with a couple of people. They also told me they saw a V formation of the same lights over the ocean on New Years Eve as well."],"Log Number":"US-07052012-0039","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Indian Harbour Beach","There were no other sightings in Indian Harbour Beach on or around July 4th 2012"],"Case Number":"40202","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-80.584332","Summary":"Red light seen during 4th of July fireworks","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
