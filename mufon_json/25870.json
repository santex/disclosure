It was pretty dark, so the light caught my attention since it was out of the ordinary. I thought it was a bird because sometimes there are white birds in the area. When i realized it wasn't, I thought it might be tractor headlights. But then I realized that it was something not ordinary. It was just kindof streaming, no curves or turns, like a bullet or projectile trajectory, just constant smooth motion. I wasn't scared, I was puzzled. If it wasn't moving so quickly I would've felt like pursuing it to see what it was. It flew over the horizon, and I watched it as long as I could."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","City":"Lingleville","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.248573,+-98.369267(25870)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25870) map </A>","Country":"United States","Latitude":"32.248573"}
