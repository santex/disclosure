I look straight up and notice a non blinking light seemingly much higher up that the tiny plane lights, and it was much brighter than plane lights. I watched it in fascination for several minutes and then it seemed to slow down and a much smaller light intersected light #1's path. Light #1 passed over the horizon and I found light #2 and watched it go in the opposite direction, while doing so a third light passed near #2. While this is going on light #2 and #3 are getting harder to see (going up into outerspace?) until finally they are no longer visible. They did not pass over the horizon like #1. They seemed to be going at climbing angles into space. Very exciting to see. We see these from time to time here. I never have my camera when I need it."],"trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Ottawa","There were no other sightings in Ottawa on or around March 15th 2009"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Ottawa"}
