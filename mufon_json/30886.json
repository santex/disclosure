Airy Rd. I saw an object float fron rt. to left over the highway ahead of me. as I caught up to it, it was kind of saucer shaped but had spikes evenly distibuted around the circumference of it. It floated in a straight line but turned to straight up and down as I was directly underneath it. I could not see it any more as it was behind me. I don't think there were any other autos around and it was a perfectly clear day. Could have been a special kids balloon, but I could not find one on the web like it anywhere. Possibly a very good hoax, Has anyone seen one like it? Kind of looked like Saturn with spikes instead of a ring around it and was about 300-500ft. up."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New Jersey","Latitude":"40.725902"}
