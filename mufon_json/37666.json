What initially appeared to be the full moon ,was an object, glowing white like the moon, except it was solid white , with no grey or dark places on the surface , like the full moon displays, moving slowly , like a top fuel dragster staging toward the starting line. Then , the object went across the entire sky ( from southeast to southwest) in one second , and flew into a small vertical shaped cloud and didn't come out of the other side. Ironically , a little further west , was the real moon , and it was not full on this night , but perhaps just a quarter moon , and it was dark orange on this night. The entire incident lasted about 1 minute. I was initially frozen in place , realizing I was witnessing an authentic ufo incident, but when in ended so abruptly , I knew that this was a situation that I may well have been the only witness , and I really didn't want to be. So , that's why I really didn't care to make a report ,because I couldn't record or photograph the object , and the date and time wasn't as important to me as actually witnessing the event for myself , so I let it go. I guess if I thought Bill Birnes was going to interview me , I think I would have risked the negativity that comes with the reports."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"Saw an object that looked like the full moon slowly move into a position then cross the sky in one second and fly into a cloud and dissapear.","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Cedar Hill","There were no other sightings in Cedar Hill on or around June 14th 2010"],"Latitude":"32.57055","Case Number":"37666","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"06/14/2010 12:00 UTC","City":"Cedar Hill","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.57055,+-96.937031(37666)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37666) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
