{"City":"Cupertino","divs":["sighting detailsat 9:54 pm i was lying on my back on the roof of our house watching the perseid meteor shower when i saw a small red point of light coming from the northwest by north (basically from the direction of san francisco) and heading in a straight line (almost directly overhead) towards the southeast by east at about 1\\3 the speed of most meteor strikes (maybe a little faster, but not more than 1\\2 the speed of a typical meteor strike), but a little while before it disappeared into the horizon (and obscured by a tree) it swerved to one side (the west side of it's path) then back to the path it was going along (the swerve was perhaps a bit larger than the moon - it wasn't just my eyes playing tricks on me, and watching it as it went through the swerve was quite fascinating as seeing an object do that in the sky at a high rate of speed is a rarity, and because i was able to tell that its change of path did indeed cause it to take longer to get to its destination [it did not change its speed at any time, as far as i could tell - just the direction of travel] [if it was just my eyes twitching to one side and back i likely would not have observed the additional time it took to make that swerve, plus i could see the shadow of trees in the background at that time so i would likely have noticed any movement caused by my eyes]). in all it took that object about 4 seconds to travel from the top of my vision (i was lying down with my head to the north) to when my sight of it was blocked by a tree. it was also quite high up so it would have to have been traveling quite fast (planes are likely to take about three minutes to travel that far across the sky at a high altitude), and it didn't make any noise. my first thought was it was a slow, red meteor strike as that's what it looked like (similar size, altitude, and brightness), but it went all the way across the sky (which i've never seen a meteor strike do [and which is made to be quite an unlikely event to see even if it occurs when considering the amount of light pollution where i live], and satellites move a whole lot slower than this did and are usually white and change in intensity as they travel across the sky), and the swerve was the most impressive part of it. i do believe the swerve was the shape of a half-circle, but i cannot be 100% certain as it was moving fast (i was closely following it with my eyes at the time and clearly able to see it when it swerved though). i can confidently say that the swerve did not have any straight lines to it. and i had been out in the dark for 50 minutes prior to seeing this object so my eyes should have been fairly well adjusted to the darkness. i did have a video camera running at the time (on a tripod, and i was paying little attention to it as there wouldn't be enough time to point it anything), but it's not sensitive enough to pick up any stars without reducing the shutter speed so much that a lot of motion is lost, and it didn't pick up any light from this object (if its field of view was wide enough considering that it was pointed to the side of the object's path). if you look at the first link below (not mine) there are a number of photographs of meteor strikes, and the one in the second link is the same color as what i saw and seems to be of a similar brightness in comparison to good meteor strikes (and it's worth pointing out that the object in that picture doesn't fade in and fade out at the beginning and end of the streak like the meteor strikes do in all of the other pictures he took).
