High in the sky coming towards me from the west going due east. They were exactly side by side. (about a finger width apart) When they reached just above me they split off in opposite directions. One going north and one going south. I followed the one going north with my eye until it was out of sight. They were screaming across the sky, maybe 3 seconds for the whole sighting. A good guess is 1000 MPH. As fast as a shooting star. It came to me that they were probes. Checking on earth for what. Either it is for our good or theirs. Unless they come to my door for tea I can only speculate but there is some known facts. for one....we humans do not have anything that does this.
