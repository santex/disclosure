When the second form came up for providing additional information, I did my best to provide the information sought. However, I now realize I incorrectly answered the queries regarding whether or not each of the witnesses wore eyeglasses. Although we all wore eyeglasses later in life, at the time of the sighting (17-Sep-1957), none of us (my father, my mother, my sister and me) wore eyeglasses."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"New York","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
