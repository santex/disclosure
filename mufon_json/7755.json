DID YOU SEE THAT?!!?\" and i said, \"yeah. i thought i imagined it.\" we continued staring at the moon for quite some time, waiting to see if we could see it again. My initial thought after seeing it was this episode of \"wren and stimpy\" i saw when i was little, about the yak that paddles in a conoe past the moon. then my friend proceeded to call it the dragon from neverending story. after all the guessing and jokes, we remained outside for about an hour and never saw anything again."],"City":"Old Town","Summary":"it was a cigar shaped thing that went past the moon faster than all the clouds.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.938845,+-68.642479(7755)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7755) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Old Town","There were no other sightings in Old Town on or around August 25th 2007"],"Date Submitted":"08/25/2007 10:00 UTC","Longitude":"-68.642479","Date of the Event":"08/25/2007 10:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08262007-0006","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Windy, Lightning, Light","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"Maine"}
