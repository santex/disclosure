They appeared to be floating as they moved foward..one would pass the other,then, as so with the other.. then they would get close to each other,then seperate..I watched this for about 3 mins... they appeared to be flying about 1000 ft. or less.I was amazed at what i was seeing..I wanted so bad to get video, but knew it wouldnt turn out..because of the lighting around me,,(streetlights)..and,if i went to get it,i would miss this..I watched them vanish upward, into some clouds.still in shock,i ran into the house and told my girlfriend the whole story,she seemed as shocked as i was..!!I have seen some odd things similar to this,but this was one of the best.."]}
