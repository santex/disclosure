Saw a bunch of lights (approx 20+) coming from the ground up to the sky and at first I though it was a tower with lights, but I had never seen it there before and the lights were moving and glowing. It looked like a bunch of huge fire flies in a group, floating up from the ground. On the ground below it looked like a large fire at first but it was just alot of light shining up from the ground in a area. I tried to take a picture with my cell phone as I drove away, afraid to stay alone. I ran home to get my 15 year old son and came back about 25 minutes later. There were only two lights flying around in the sky when we got back and as we stopped to watch, one seemed to change direction and slowly come towards us, so we left. I have a picture on my cell phone of just a few of the lights I saw as I was driving away."],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":[],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.559451,+-105.775217(38112)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38112) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/13/2012 11:28 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/12/2012 10:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38112.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38112.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"20 + star like objects ascending from an area of light on the ground in Boulder, CO","Log Number":"US-05132012-0009","Latitude":"39.559451"}
