It was a cloudy day and sun hitting clouds directly in front of me and something caught my eye(like a movement different from the clouds) to where I slowed and tried to see it better. The clouds were low and colored from light to dark and I seen a blue blimp looking craft,not extremely high altitude it seemed. It seemed to be big,like a blimp and moved at a fairly good speed right amongst the clouds going from west to east in a straight line. I had a car behind me ,so I had to look at the road and drive,but it did not really fit,that it moved steady and at a good speed,but was not like a plane and was right in the rain clouds. I must admit,I just couldn't make a definite identification that quick,but as a few days went by,it just keeps sticking in my mind that it was out of place compared to anything I ever seen. It was light blue,but as it went in front of darker clouds ,it stood out from the background. I was just curious if any reports by others from my area have been reported."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-02072008-0016","Longitude":"-82.906073","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"02/03/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"9487","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9487.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9487.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Blimp","Date Submitted":"02/03/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"driving east on st.rt. 554,seen blue blimp shaped object in clouds moving west to east","City":"Undisclosed"}
