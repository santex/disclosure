{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWent out to smoke a cig and witnessed what looked like a star moving across the sky. I thought maybe it was a plane at first but this was not blinking. I called my friend and made him go outside and he was seeing what I was seeing. He recently saw possibly the same object on saint Patrick's day at a local bar we frequently visit. He has that sighting on tape"],"Case Number":"37166","Latitude":"27.61884","City":"Vero Beach","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37166.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37166.html"],"Longitude":"-80.409183","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.61884,+-80.409183(37166)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37166) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Star like moving across the sky from spnorth to south did not blink like plane was solid","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/06/2012 11:32 UTC","Log Number":"US-04062012-0014","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"04/06/2012 09:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Vero Beach","There was one other sighting in Vero Beach on or around April 6th 2012"]}
