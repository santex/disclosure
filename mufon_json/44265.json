{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Large triangle stealth like structure in sky with lights moving slowly","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"44265","Object Shape":"Triangle","Log Number":"US-12012012-0002","trends":["There have been no other sightings in O'Neill","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Date Submitted":"12/01/2012 12:11 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and I were driving to our cabin when I noticed an object only a few hundred feet in the air, it was moving slowly with several lights, almost resembling a combine in the air. It had one pulsating orange ish light and several small white lights around the border that easily resemble stars however it defiantly formed the outline of the object. The first time we saw it for only thirty seconds before all of a sudden it was gone. The second time was a few miles further down the road when my son noticed it again. This time we watched it slowly move Northeast, we were driving 70mph and it was pulling away from us. At first I thought it could be a large aircraft like a B-2 bomber however I've never seen a plane that could move that slow. It definitely blended into the sky well but the lights easily made it stand out in the dark sky. I'm still very unsure what it is we saw but know for a fact it's nothing like anything I've seen before."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-98.647888","Latitude":"42.457672","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Nebraska","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.457672,+-98.647888(44265)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44265) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/30/2012 07:05 UTC","Object Features":"Wings","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44265.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44265.html"],"City":"O'Neill"}
