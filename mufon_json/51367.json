It was moving south to north, the light went dim and it kept moving getting smaller and higher. It was moving quicker than I usually see satellites passing. I first thought it was an airplane but had no flashing lights and there is no airport in that direction. I then thought it may be the ISS but I've seen that and the light is constant and does not travel in that direction. The fact that it moved fairly quickly and got dimmer and smaller unlike a satellite got my attention. It was a very clear low humidity evening, cloudless. It got out of sight much sooner that I have seen satellites and it got smaller and dimmer leaving me to believe that it was traveling away quickly. It did not act at all like an airplane or helicopter. There is a satellite that travels almost directly overhead about 9:10PM every night.This makes a good reference for speed and visibility."],"Case Number":"51367","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.213102","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-77.184905","trends":[],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"10/01/2013 09:20 UTC"}
