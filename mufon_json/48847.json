My mother and I working at the bar, did not notice the orb until later...For the past four days I have been on lookout for the same UFO in hopes that I could capture it on camera again. This time, however, it did not last a long time in the sky and it seemed to be trying to cloak itself. The orb seemed more blue than black and it was faint. The video I took did not show anything compared to what I witnessed. After a while of checking up on it, the object hovered straight down in less than ten seconds, no drifting side to side, no struggle, just straight down. I attempted to record the descent, running past the building to get a better shot, but could not due to it being too dark. Next time, if I see it, I will use my mother's phone and get as close as possible."],"Summary":"Same black orb UFO witnessed four days ago, only descended straight down before sunrise.
