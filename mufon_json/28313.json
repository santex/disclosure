{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile I was driving out of my apartment complex to go observe the super moon, I looked up on the sky and noticed a cluster of red lights. I was facing south, when I noticed them in the sky. There was approximately 8 lights close together moving slowly towards the west but in different speeds. My first thought was that they were maybe helicopters, but they were too close together, and the lights weren't flashing like an aircraft. I kept starring, and noticed that they were slowly disappearing one by one until there were none. When they disappeared, the sky was clear and no clouds were visible. It's been my first sighting,and it was about 10 seconds only, but I felt an amazing feeling inside of me and I was hoping to see them again. Before I started my report, I checked to see if there was anyone else who reported seeing the same thing, and I saw that someone had taken a picture of the super moon and in the picture was a red orb identical to what I had seen. But what I saw was a couple of those same lights."],"Summary":"Red lights in the sky","Case Number":"28313","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"25.791909","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/19/2011 08:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"03/19/2011 11:08 UTC","Log Number":"US-03192011-0026","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There were no other sightings in Miami on or around March 19th 2011"],"City":"Miami","Longitude":"-80.224879","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28313.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28313.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.791909,+-80.224879(28313)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28313) map </A>"}
