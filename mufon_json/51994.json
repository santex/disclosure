{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy boyfriend and I were driving down the hills of woodland. I noticed a \"triangular\" shape of orange glowing lights I had never seen before. Looked almost as they were hovering or moving very slowly. It was over cast outside and raining. Recently went dark out. They were under the clouds, but too high to be electrical power lines. I was just staring at them, until we eventually drove to where we couldn't see them any longer."],"Log Number":"US-11032013-0003","Region":"Washington","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-122.743991","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Woodland","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Case Number":"51994","Source":"MUFON","City":"Woodland","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51994.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51994.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/03/2013 12:41 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.904559,+-122.743991(51994)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51994) map </A>","Latitude":"45.904559","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/02/2013 06:30 UTC","Summary":"Orange orbs","Object Features":"Unknown"}
