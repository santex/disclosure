The craft did not have no sound at all. It was very quiet gliding across the sky. I just woke up exactly at 4:00 a.m. getting up out of my bed looking out my window when I spotted the craft. This is no joke. For a person who didnt believe that UFO's existed, I jumped out of my skin. I knew definitely it was not an airplane, nor jet. ABSOLUTELY!!! POSITIVELY!!! You may call me. But I don't have a camera available, now I will purchase one soon. For sure..."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
