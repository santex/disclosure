I set the tripod and camera on flash off mode to let it do it's thing and set the 10 second timer on the tripod so it would be steady. I didn't see it when I focussed the camera on the Moon behind the clouds. I took a few photos and it appeared in a few of them as a pale blue green orb at first it was below where the Moon was and then it was above it in the next shot. Don't know if this is something for real or not but it was there. I have photos if there is a place to send them. I have attached the photos and the file 4 and 5 are of the Moon that night at the same time period. File 1,2,3 are showing the object. Hope this is of some interest to you."],"Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/03/2013 08:49 UTC","Case Number":"45000","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"New Caney","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.187777,+-95.164664(45000)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45000) map </A>"}
