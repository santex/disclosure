At first thought it was a plastic bag blowing in the sky or a very large bird, but it instantly disappeared and then reappeared nearby with the blink of the eye. It reminded me of what an \"invisible cloak\" should look like (shimmery yet transparent). It just sort or shimmered and then disappeared and then reappeared off to each side (both right and then left) and then disappeared for good. This all took place in a matter of 20 seconds or so. Feelings were more intrigue and curiousity trying to figure out what we saw. Lost sight as it just never reappeared after disappearing the last time."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ijamsville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Ijamsville","Summary":"Appeared below clouds and looked shimmery transparent blob that changed direction instantly"}
