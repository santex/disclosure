Give me a polygraph if you look you will see i have posted a detailed description of the event and I dont mind telling you about it again. The time it happend is approximate. But I saw it big and colorful and plain as day creaping up on my neihbors house I said oh [pd] then it shot a bluish beem out of it that went through my neigbors house(trailor) and his house didnt even cast a shadow the light went through it. then it slowely scanned 45 degrees to its left until it hit my face, then all i remember is waking up on the floor paralysed . Give me a polygraph and I swear i will pass with flying colors. I will get perfect score with no deception i have no reason to lie it would be embarrasing to get caught and IM not worried about that. I will pass."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
