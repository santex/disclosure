{"Date of the Event":"05/11/2012 09:00 UTC","City":"San Jose","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy Dad saw three bright red lights that formed a triangle hovering South San Jose, CA last night around 8:50-9:00 PM while he was outside locking his truck up for the night. He called my house and told me to run outside and look up in the sky towards his place. I am about 6-7 miles from his place. I couldn't see anything, but he was still watching it while I was on the phone with him. I would say the event lasted 5+ minutes until he lost sight of the lights. I am not sure what he witnessed, but it looks like people in other states witnessed something similar last night."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.341336,+-121.889076(38105)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38105) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.341336","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"05/13/2012 12:53 UTC","Case Number":"38105","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were no other sightings in San Jose on or around May 11th 2012"],"Summary":"3 bright red lights in a triangle shape hovering over South San Jose last night.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05132012-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38105.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38105.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-121.889076","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
