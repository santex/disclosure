{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt flew in from the south east looking like a clear plastic bag blowing in the wind from a distance. As it got closer I could tell that it was shaped like a giant blood cell. Clear and nearly invisible with a dark center. It hovered above me and never made a noise. I wanted to get a camera but I was affraid it would fly away from me. Eventually it did fly off in a north east direction. As it flew off into the distance all I could see was the dark center of the ship. I don't know if it makes any differnce but I was praying to GOD for a sign right before I saw the object. The Bible describes numerous ufo's so I wander if God really did give me a sign."],"Longitude":"-80.757933","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Latitude":"37.969554","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date Submitted":"12/10/2011 05:19 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Rainelle","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"04/22/2003 03:30 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33951.html"],"Region":"West Virginia","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.969554,+-80.757933(33951)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33951) map </A>","Summary":"from a distance it looked like a clear plastic bag but As it soon hovered above me it was cloaked making it nearly invisible but I could clearly see that it was a large cicle with a dark center.
