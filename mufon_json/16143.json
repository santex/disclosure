Saw a star-like object to the west that was flashing red, green and blue every 2 seconds. T first when I saw it it remained rather still, until it darted from left to right in less than a second. If you hold your hand up to the sky the sitnace would be about a spread finger's worth. I called my sister outside and see verified it wasn't a plane. We live in the OIA landing corridor about 3 miles out. I tried to get photos from my phone but it is a POS Nokia low-end. This object while I was watching it turned a slow circle like it was banking, and then proceeded to the west and dsiappeared."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Flashing primary colors.","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"28.539526","City":"Orlando","Log Number":"US-03212009-0001","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16143.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16143.html"],"trends":["There have been 112 other sightings in Orlando","There were no other sightings in Orlando on or around March 21st 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.539526,+-81.371686(16143)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16143) map </A>"}
