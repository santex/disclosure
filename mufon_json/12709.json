Oh sure. We went out and sure enough there was a star-like object moving erratically in the sky overhead. It would stay still and then swiftly move in one direction and then just as quickly move in another direction. We watched it until we were tired of it. I dont know how much longer it was there but we watched for at least 15 minutes in the front of my house. There were four of us. The one who called us out said she had seen the same thing once before. The person who first saw it was not a starwatcher. She just happened to notice the unusual movement."],"Log Number":"US-09222008-0005","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Grand Island"}
