{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe witness, a 41 year old male, was outside smoking when he noted a low flying object moving from the southwest to a northeast direction. He described it as being a triangle shape with no lights visible and no sound heard. He estimated it as flying at about 500to 1,000 feet altitude and it appeared to be doing a ���flipping motion���. He is certain it was no conventional aircraft. The duration was brief, 30-45 seconds, and then it vanished from his sight."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/28/2012 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.669313,+-86.153896(40106)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40106) map </A>","Summary":"Flying object","Tags":"City","Region":"Indiana","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/03/2012 01:18 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-86.153896","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Mishawaka","There was one other sighting in Mishawaka on or around June 28th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40106.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40106.html"],"City":"Mishawaka","Case Number":"40106","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07032012-0013","Latitude":"41.669313"}
