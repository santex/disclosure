{"Log Number":"US-09052011-0022","divs":["Sighting DetailsStanding around swimming pool with my kids when this storm came up out of nowhere and the objects appeared in the sky coming out of the clouds. We all looked in awe and watched them descend and ascend and hover and move slightly back and forth. Then they ascended into the thunder head and there was a terribly storm that lasted for about 30 minutes. The objects were almost directly over us. They must have been really large since they were so prominent in the sky over head. Maybe the size of a large passenger plane or larger. We were not scared as we did not know what we were looking at, I called a government agency and provided them our location and faxed drawing. The phone numbers that I connected with were not usable following my report and fax. That was most remarkable thing of the entire event, in a way."],"City":"Independence","Date of the Event":"07/01/2005 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.037408,+-94.397284(31564)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31564) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/05/2011 08:17 UTC","Case Number":"31564","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31564.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31564.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.037408","Summary":"color was most unusual sooty deep black - almost indescribable. like a negative and positive sign was the shape as they descended from severe storm clouds that developed out of nowhere.
