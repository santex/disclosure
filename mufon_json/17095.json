I caught a glimpse of a bright light to my right, the south, in the tree line of a maple tree. At my vantage point of the couch the light and halo was approx nickel sized at arms length. I yelled for my girlfriend to follow me outside to see it, as I ran out in my boxers, it just kept flying very smooth in an East direction over the city of Marquette until it faded to sand grain size over the old harbor of Marquette on Lake Superior. I definitely felt in awe of the object I had seen up close and then as it moved away my girlfriend acted a little out of the ordinary and said she felt \"creeped out\", or that it was \"creepy out in the dark\", though when asked shortly after her feelings and reactions, she said \"I felt like I was being watched\". However, I felt nothing out of the ordinary, just impressed.
