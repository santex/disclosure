{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was about 11:35 pm March 12 2011, I came out side to look at the stars and give my dog her massage before bed, I looked up in the SE sky over Powdery, Texas,just E of hwy 271 and I saw what I thought was going to be a shooting star or meteroit as it had a much larger tail behind it. It traved horizontally across the sky with no decention.. I was quite intrigued as to what happened next. A very large brilliant bright green a fireball like sphere appeared in front of the tail. It remained there traveling hoizontally for a few more moments,15-20 seconds and just disappearred tail and all! There was no fading just gone. The whole event encompassed approx.45seconds. The .very large size of the object made the stars appear to be tiny crystals far in the distance. I was awe struck andfound myself repeating \" Oh my Gosh What is that?\" I immediatly ran inside and told my Mother what Id witnessed. I ve always watched the stars since I was a child and have seen many beautiful things but never anything quite so faboulous and so close."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.811111,+-95.524167(28222)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28222) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Summary":"Huge!
