I notice a red flaming light hovering. I thought maybe it was a helicopter but it made no noise. This was the second time i've seen it. It started moving left to right and up and down. People around me started seeing it as well. Then it quickly moved away to the left and moving upward. It moved very fast and then disappeared. Just yesterday it reappeared again. Doing the samething but i was driving. People around me stopped and started to look at this star looking thing. It had the same look and shape as before. No clouds in the area which made it very clear. It then started moving and then disappeared again. Many witness saw it. It was cool when you see it u just know it wasn't a helicopter or airplane.
