There were two sets of lights in a boomerang shape. The were very high in the sky and flying in circles around each other. They would fade in and out like the lights were only on one side of the crafts. We ran inside and when we came out it looked like 3 planes were flying around the area where we had seen the lights."],"Date Submitted":"11/03/2008 10:20 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Object Flight Path":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/03/2008 10:20 UTC","Case Number":"13518","Summary":"Lights flying over Boulder","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Broomfield","There were no other sightings in Broomfield on or around November 3rd 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.920541,+-105.08665(13518)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13518) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-11042008-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13518.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13518.html"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Colorado","City":"Broomfield","Latitude":"39.920541"}
