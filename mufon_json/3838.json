{"Date Submitted":"11/30/0002 06:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.165357","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting details>>1. where were you and what were you doing at the time? i was with my wife and son playing in our apartment playground, swinging on the swings. >>2. what made you first notice the object? my son enjoys spotting airplanes\\helicopters in the sky. i noticed a jet in the distance to the northeast and pointed it out to him. i scanned the skies for additional planes, then noticed a small point to the southeast that looked like a strong reflective glint. i focused on it a bit more (i was in motion on the swing, but stopped after a few seconds), then noticed that the bright point had several (6-8) similarly small points arranged around it in an irregular pattern. the surrounding point objects were not as bright\\reflective. >>3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it? truly did not know what it could be - perhaps some kind of large high-altitude balloon. but i could not reconcile why several other point objects would be around the bright point. they were not moving like a flock of birds and i did not think they were a group of consumer balloons (e.g. reflective mylar novelty balloons) >>4. describe the object and its actions. in addition to what i described above, i returned to swinging on the swings since my son was insisting noisily that i resume our family activities. while swinging and watching the object group, i noticed one of the peripheral objects move in a horizontal, straight line -- it did not appear to leave the basic perimeter area of the arrangement. i looked away for a few moments, then looked up and saw the overall group was slowly heading south and disappearing behind a tree in my view. >>5. describe your reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. i was very puzzled, trying to figure out a rational explanation for the objects. i observed several jet airliners flying in the general vicinity and they seemed to clearly be at a lower altitude than these point objects. i asked my wife to confirm she could see the objects too and she did. they have been on my mind for hours after the event! :-) >>6. how did you lose sight of the object? as noted, when i looked for the group they seemed to be moving lower in the horizon (due south) to the point of being obscured by a tree and apartment roofline. i lost sight completely after about 5 minutes and did not attempt to gain a clearer view from a different location."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09122005-0001","City":"Los Angeles","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around November 30th 2002"],"Summary":"Grouping of tiny white/silver objects","Case Number":"3838","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3838.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3838.html"],"Date of the Event":"11/30/2002 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-118.608975","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.165357,+-118.608975(3838)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3838) map </A>"}
