They were there for about an hour and then they just shot off and I could no longer see them. I noticed them because they were so bright, at first I thought they were lights from a tower but I realized there is no tower in the area I saw the lights and they weren't blinking and there was no red light at the top for aircraft, so I continued to watch the lights until they took off. It was very exciting when I realized that I had just seen something I couldn't explain. My cousin and mother both saw the ligths."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.502755","Log Number":"US-11282008-0011","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Cigar","City":"Cleveland"}
