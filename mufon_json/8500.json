I had been sleeping then awoke suddenly & got out of bed. I walked over to my dresser where there were 3 white, bald humanoid creatures that were about as tall as I was. I wasn���t scared, just curious. The main guy was standing closest to me & the others were behind to the side him. He motioned to the dresser where there was a large bottle of pills tipped over & spilt out onto the surface. There was no speaking involved, but I knew he wanted me to take a pill. I refused & he insisted again. At this point I became very afraid & turned to open bedroom door which was a few feet to my right. I ran toward the door, but was blocked in the doorway. Now I was so frightened, I could see the brightly lit hallway just a few feet away & the stairs. I tried again & was still resisted. The third time I broke through & ran downstairs to my mom. I still remember this incident vividly & wonder what would have happed if I���d taken a pill & how did I eventually get through the door (was there something or someone protecting me). I wondered if it had been a dream, but the fact that I ran out & downstairs & remembered going back to bed after being downstairs was unusual to me - unless I���d been dreaming & sleeping walking. After that night I was intrigued & terrified of UFOs & aliens. I was afraid that ET would come & get me & if Battlestar Galactica was on I���d close my eyes so I wouldn���t see the bald aliens. I had many dreams about UFOs landing in my yard & a particularly freaky dream of a typical gray peeking in my window (which has access from a rooftop). The second part of this story came in approx. 1999, when I jokingly asked the family at Thanksgiving dinner if anybody had ever seen a UFO. My older brother, who is a big serious guy said that he had seen a UFO when he was about 15 yrs old. He saw it out his bedroom window (which was in the front of the house, mine in the back) & it was about a block away. I asked him if he was serious & he was - he doesn���t make things up & especially about something like this. I had never told anyone about my incident until 2000 & never told my brother. Every night I was terrified until maybe 16 or 17 yrs old when I KNEW so deep within myself that I didn���t have to be afraid anymore. I don���t believe I was ever ���abducted��� & am not sure about the whole aliens from another world concept, but do believe there are many things in this world, universe & dimensions that we don���t have a clue about. I am a medical professional in good health & come from a loving & stable family. I have always liked the bible verse ���He has given his angels charge over you to guard you in all your ways��� . Now that I think of it, it���s still written on the attic door that was right near my room at my parent���s house. Also, now that I remember I did have nightmares when I was young - many were about something coming out of the dark & I���m cowering in the corner of my room & trying to scream, but can���t. But I know that nightmares are common in childhood & sleep is a strange phenomenon & can generate situations & feelings that seem real, but aren���t. That���s why I���ll never really know if all that I went through was just in my mind or was a real, physical event with mysterious creatures. I���m a seeing-is-believing kind of gal & super practical, but like the idea of the strange, unusual & unknown. Now, I have the X-Files theme song in my mind���"],"Case Number":"8500","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Sugar Grove","There were no other sightings in Sugar Grove on or around May 28th 1983"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"An unusual incident...","Longitude":"-88.441006","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
