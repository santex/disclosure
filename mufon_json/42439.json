Below the cloud cover which was sporadic that night. They traveled in a line until they disappeared over the Horizon.I could not hear any noise I also saw in July around 3PM while sitting on my deck Red Box Like objects coming from the North and traveling directly over my head to the south. At that time I noticed about 4 of these objects. They looked like box kites, traveling what would appear about 70- 80mph at a low altitude probably about 200 ft above tree height. They came in a straight line and appeared coming out of no where. They had no sound. When I observed the Saturday night traveling lights I observed they were about the same size as the July objects I saw"],"Date of the Event":"09/08/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.688205","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09102012-0012","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42439.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42439.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.688205,+-83.152656(42439)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42439) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
