I looked up at that time and a HUGE (I cant sress enough how big it was) was hovering directly overtop of us all. It was the brightest white I had ever seen. It, whatever it was, only stayed within view for about 3-4 seconds. I dont know how long it was there before we noticed it. After we had all noticed it was there, it disapered. The light turned off and was gone. I bust into tears of fear afterwards and we all went inside for the night. We had seen multiple other crafts that summer and that sighting certainly was'nt the last. We have had multiple sightings following the one described above."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wallins Creek","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"41314","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Kentucky","Latitude":"36.794162","Log Number":"US-07312012-0013","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41314.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41314.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.794162,+-83.400525(41314)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41314) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.400525","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"HUGE white light right over top of me.","City":"Wallins Creek","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
