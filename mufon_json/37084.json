{"Summary":"Witnessed two Triangle / Chevron fly over head","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["sighting detailsat 8:15pm i witnessed a triangle \\ chevron shaped craft approach me from a compass heading approximately 315 degrees nw above the tree line at our home. the first indication was this very bright red light coming towards me; one would estimate its size to 1.5 times the size of the full moon. as it passed directly overhead, one could see it was a dimmed triangle outline with a very bright red luminous light with a little hit of orange underneath? this craft made no noise what���s so ever it was completely silent it���s heading before disappearing was approximately 147 degrees se. this craft must be between ��� and ��� mile high. i rushed indoors to tell my wife what i just witnessed; my wife came out immediately and then she asked me what is this large red light coming towards us, i said that was the same direction of the one i saw, no blinking lights same type of craft, my wife started waving at it as it got directly overhead. my wife started waving at it and it started to slow down, then the red light suddenly got very bright, and moved on at steady pace flew over our house no sound and it just disappeared. as it continued to get darker we decided watch longer, these are not the only sightings we have seen at this location. we saw a star like object moving, erratically across the sky, would stop and change directions and then eventually stopping and staying stationary. three of the same type of objects would behave similarly one would occasionally glow red off and on whilst it was stationary. one came from compass heading 130 degrees se and crossed in front of the moon, departed with a heading of 25 degrees n. note, my satellite finder showed no satellites in this area"],"Region":"North Carolina","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37084.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37084.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.664117,+-81.33952(37084)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37084) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Hickory","Log Number":"US-04022012-0016","Date of the Event":"04/02/2012 08:15 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-81.33952","Latitude":"35.664117","trends":["There have been 33 other sightings in Hickory","There were no other sightings in Hickory on or around April 2nd 2012"],"Case Number":"37084","Date Submitted":"04/02/2012 10:29 UTC"}
