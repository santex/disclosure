There were no clouds; the sky was completely clear. I saw a light appear in the south. It was joined by a cone of light below it, the whole effect looking like a spotlight from a helicopter or a flashlight pointing down from above, shining through fog or smoke. The bright light lasted 10-15 seconds, finally flickering out and leaving just the cloud, which faded quickly. I went inside to get my wife and she noticed I was shaken up."],"Case Number":"19438","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.959535,+-75.155859(19438)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19438) map </A>","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around September 19th 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19438.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19438.html"]}
