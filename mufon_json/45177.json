Upon looking closely I saw it was flashing brightly and I noticed it moving back and forth. Upon further investigation the object at some points moved in a circular pattern, and at one point was clearly moving toward my direction, becoming bigger and brighter. I went back into the house and back out several times, and each time it had moved from its previous position. Eventually I went back out and the object was only very faint, and had almost disappeared into the distance."],"Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"01/13/2013 04:03 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Ocala","There were no other sightings in Ocala on or around January 13th 2013"]}
