It was approximately 11:30pm and I was outside with a digital camera nearby. I had nothing special in mind but, due to the bizarre experience I had last October 2006(this experience has been recorded on the Mufon web site), I always keep a camera on hand when I'm out at night. A bright light again caught my eye and I observed this rectangular shaped light begin to rise slowly behind a tree line in the south approximately 1 mile away. This object appeared to hover for about 20 seconds and then began to travel west at a very slow speed. As it began moving west, it seemed to pivot on both the vertical and horizontal axis revealing more detail until it disappeared behind a tree line. I captured this object with my digital and the pictures came out surprisingly well. I use a Canon 20D-A which I use for astrophotography. I have transferred these images to a disc."],"Region":"New Jersey","Summary":"saw a bright rectangular object which pivoted on both axis.","Case Number":"8111","City":"Bridgeton","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bridgeton","There were no other sightings in Bridgeton on or around September 24th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/24/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States"}
