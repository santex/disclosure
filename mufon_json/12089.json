{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis evening Aug 15, 2008, backyard nearly dark at about 10:00pm clear night stargazing for a bit, wife was startled seeing what she thought was a shooting star at first. At nearly the same moment looking in about the same direction I caught it north about 30 degrees up from the horizon. An extremely bright object appeared seemingly out of nowhere like a flash bulb that didn't turn off. In a matter of seconds it seemed to accelerate??? climbing a few degrees higher and vanished ( no joke, I���m a skeptic and show me the evidence science kind of guy, but think sci-fi movie where object appears in and out of warp speed as it jumps, sorry, only sane way I can even describe it). This object was twice if not three times the size and brightness off the scale of any planet or star we've ever observed in the Idaho night sky. Wife has a slightly different interpretation seeing it a fraction of a second before I did and said it seemed to pulse in spurts then accelerate and vanish. No noise, no afterburner, if landing lights from a plane, object was moving in the opposite direction (seen landing lights come into and out of view, a much slower event). No red or green nav lights, just incredibly bright white orb that seemed to come out of nowhere. A plane flew over the house a minute later confirming the extreme difference with what we had just witnessed. We stared dumb founded and afterwards looked at each other in disbelief. We have seen both military (Gowen Field, Mountain Home Air Base) and commercial (Boise) aircraft fly over the house for many years and this was like nothing we'd ever seen before. Read recent reports before filing this. I was struck by a few that were very similar particularly with��� 2008-08-11 Bright round white light flashed only once among the stars. MN, US���. I don���t know what we saw, but it was no aircraft I���ve ever seen nor was it a meteor because it went up not down."],"Longitude":"-116.201256","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"12089","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Boise","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.618341","Date of the Event":"08/15/2008 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"extremely bright object appeared seemingly out of nowhere","Region":"Idaho","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.618341,+-116.201256(12089)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12089) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There were no other sightings in Boise on or around August 15th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12089.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12089.html"],"Log Number":"US-08162008-0002","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"08/15/2008 12:00 UTC"}
