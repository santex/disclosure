{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01262010-0015","Country":"United States","Case Number":"21662","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Summary":"Dark grey boat shaped object no sound or lights.","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Kenosha","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting Detailsthe UFO in counter was around 12:46 am on the 10th of january my mom woke up and saw a huge object outside the window it was very close to the window just hovering made no noise and had no lights my mom describes the shape as a boat it had a circular shape on the bottom and a shape of a boat it was silver she says as the color of rain clouds. The object was about 400 feet from the window we live on the third floor and my mom window over looks the street and she saw the spacecraft for about 4 to 5 seconds she couldn't take her eyes off of it as she was looking outside she noticed that there was no cars as she was going to call me and my husband to see this object it disappeared some clouds was forming around it an it disappeared. The strange thing about all this was that I had been dreaming about aliens every single night it might sound crazy but it seemed in my dreams as if I was talking to them. I told my husband about my strange dreams but never mentioned anything to my mom. Now we do live in the same house so it���s kind of hard to believe that I didn't tell her but I didn't so after a whole week of dreaming about aliens every single day the morning of my mom sighting she came to me and told me of what happened that night and then I told her about my dreams. It was really strange because I have been dreaming about it and she basically confirmed what I was dreaming about. Now it takes me a lot of guts to actually post this message but I think if there is anything out there it is worth to have as many evidence possible. Even though this has happened to us I am still a skeptic because I didn't see the object I just had dreams so like they say seeing is believing so until I actually see it then I will believe it. My mom is convinced that there is aliens because she has seen it twice in brazil, once in Miami which supposedly they placed something in her ear that is what she says and that she saw them and she describes what they look like and here in Wisconsin so she is convinced that it is true that there is something out there. My mom request if possible that you could see if there was any unidentified objects reported here in Wisconsin on that date or any radar date because she is convinced that it will show because she says this object was enormous."],"Latitude":"42.588972","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21662.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21662_submitter_file1__IMG_NEW.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21662_submitter_file2__IMG_0001.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21662.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.813895","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/26/2010 01:08 UTC","Region":"Wisconsin","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.588972,+-87.813895(21662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21662) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Kenosha","There were no other sightings in Kenosha on or around","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
