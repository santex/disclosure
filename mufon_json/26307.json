Immediately after that I saw a white sphere heading north across the plane's path. I watched the sphere as it continued north and then it suddenly vanished. I noticed the object because I was curious about why the jet was flying south. When I first noticed the sphere I thought it might be a fighter jet or some small fast aircraft because of the speed. I have never seen even a small jet move that fast from such a distance. My next thought was that I saw a UFO, especially because of the plane's reaction to it, and how it just disappeared. It might be something very normal, but I'd really like to know just what that would be."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/02/2010 08:04 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.042585,+-117.040936(26307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26307) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"26307","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Latitude":"34.042585","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-117.040936","City":"Yucaipa","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26307.html"]}
