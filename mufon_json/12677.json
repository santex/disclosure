I wanted to look for a meteor so I looked up. I thought I saw one except it behaved strangely. It headed south for a few seconds before turning abruptly to face almost northeast, a huge change in direction. It continued traveling northeast before disappearing. It was hard to see since it was moving so fast but it looked like a meteor or little star. In fact, I would of assumed it was a meteor if it weren't for the HUGE direction change. I dismissed what I saw at first and tried to think of how a meteor could change direction so quickly before realizing it could be a UFO. My friend didn't notice or care, and dismissed it entirely. I never suggested to him, though, that it was a UFO."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"44.240362","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12677.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12677.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/30/0002 10:00 UTC","Region":"Ontario"}
