Thought it may be an airplane at first but it looked a little too bright. I waited to see if there were any flashing lights and the object seemed to be slowly weaving back and forth as it moved. I watched it for maybe 15 seconds and it slowly started to turn red and dim out until it vanished. Absolutely no noise coming from the object and i usually hear any aircraft that close. About 5 minutes later I was still looking around the sky, looked straight up and saw a very bright white light flash that lasted for less than 1 second. Looked almost Venus appearing and disappering. 10 second later another flash but very dim in exact same spot. No clouds in the sky or anything to distort my view."]}
