{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile walking my dog--(about 8:35---8:50 PM Monday Feb 21 2010)--in a south to north direction--I looked up at the clearing but still cloudy sky and saw what appeared to be a very large and bright star become visible through the broken cloud cover behind me and moving fast in a south to north direction--it passed over me(slightly to my right--east)and entered clear skies over my head and in front of me--I got a real good look at it and have no idea what it was--it remained in my sight for a few seconds--(3-4) and then became obscured by clouds to the north and it was gone---Let me say that I am not the type of person who would waste my time or yours with a ufo report if I didnt think I saw something really strange--I cant put this out of my mind--it was that weird--so here I am telling YOU--there was very little ground light--I had a good view of the sky--I am used to seeing aircraft headed for palm beach international flying at about 35000 feet--this was higher--bigger--much faster--no strobe lights(I would have easily been able to see them if it was a plane)--it was going way to slow for a meteorite and not leaving a streak as they usually do--but going way WAY to fast for any aircraft and not loosing any altitude like a falling meteor--although I couldnt see it cross the entire sky-- from what I did see I would estimate that it would cross the sky horizon to horizon in about 11 or 12 seconds--also this neighborhood being as quiet as it is--I would have been able to hear a jet--this was silent--I once saw the international space station cross the sky on a really clear night in New York--it appeared to look much like this thing but not quite as fast and maybe not quite as bright--as best as I can determine-the space station was not visible from here at that time--thought I had the answer but apparently not--did anyone else see what I saw?--I hope somebody has the answer--thank you for your time and if anyone can ID this thing please let me know.."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22007.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22007.html"],"City":"Port St Lucie","Date Submitted":"02/25/2010 02:54 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.35128","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.279593,+-80.35128(22007)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22007) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/21/2010 08:40 UTC","Region":"Florida","Summary":"observed unusual light in sky","Sighting Duration":"00:00:06","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02252010-0003","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Port St Lucie","There were no other sightings in Port St Lucie on or around February 21st 2010"],"Latitude":"27.279593","Tags":"City","Case Number":"22007","Object Features":"Unknown"}
