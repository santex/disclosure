{"Tags":"City","Latitude":"43.083978","Object Shape":"Disc","divs":["Sighting Detailsvery clear, sunny day. Was outside on my deck when I noticed alot of jets streaking across the sky leaving trails. (See attached photo for reference of this description.) I noticed that to the left of the sun, there appeared to be a \"rainbow-type\" spot in the sky, and to the left of that appeared to be a shrouded, dome-shaped object that the jets were flying toward. Ran in, grabbed my camera, and snapped this picture of the jets approaching the object (to the left of he sun). I know the small blue dots are \"flare\" from the sunlight.........but the orb is NOT."],"Date Submitted":"11/19/2012 12:56 UTC","City":"Flushing","Log Number":"US-11192012-0013","Longitude":"-83.859974","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.083978,+-83.859974(44027)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44027) map </A>","Object Features":"Dome","Region":"Michigan","Sighting Duration":"12:42:00","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Flushing","There were no other sightings in Flushing on or around November 19th 2012"],"Summary":"strange-looking fluorescent dome-shaped object in sky with 2 jets approaching","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/19/2012 12:42 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44027.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44027.html"],"Case Number":"44027","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
