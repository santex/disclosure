{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"7536","Summary":"Large, bright, silent firey-looking object appeared in west and moved away, disappearing SSW","divs":["sighting detailsi was in my driveway viewing jupiter last night when i noticed a very bright and large object west (or perhaps wnw), approximately the size of a thumbnail at arm's length (\"apparent size,\" in the astronomer sense, so a thumbnail or penny or so actually meaning very large). it was too dark to see any structure to the object, just the light it was emitting. it was also impossible to guess its distance, and thus altitude, but it was 30-40 degrees above the horizon for the duration of its visibility. obviously, i've never seen anything like it or even close. it moved against the winds to a ssw bearing as it grew smaller and eventually disappeared over the course of 3 or perhaps 5 minutes but maintaining a similar degree-elevation throughout. because of how large and bright it initially was i was struck by the conspicuous absence of any noise whatsoever. i tried to look at it through my telescope but it was moving too quickly to track, although still slowly enough for its size to have a floaty look to it. i'd estimate its bearing changed 30-45 degrees in the 3-5 minutes it was visible. i grabbed a pair of binoculars and was able to see it through those, but with no more useful detail. as i watched and tried to figure out what it could possibly be i had very few ideas. its size, silence, and brightness ruled out pretty much all aircraft, and i haven't thought of anything feasible all day today either. i have read about comets of startling size and brightness, although this object had no tail and its movement was near perpendicular to the ecliptic. i also don't believe it could've been debris burning as it fell to earth because its motion appeared to be at a consistent (if indeterminable) altitude. the fact that it was so large and bright and mysterious was a little spooky, but mostly i was just completely fascinated. at first i just stared at it for a minute or so. then i tried to track it with my telescope a few times. unable to, i grabbed binoculars that were just inside the house (running, for fear it would take off suddenly) and looked at it through those. when it disappeared i remember it fading in and out a bit when it was very small and dim and i could barely see it, which i remember reminding me at the time of an ember burning out, although i thought it was actually the same brightness but simply moving too far for me to see, or perhaps obscured by clouds i could not see. i don't know what the visibility was last night, although i suppose when looking at a light source all bets are kinda off on \"visibility\" distances anyway. there were actually very few clouds and seeing was good, although the transparency was poor as if the high humidity went to the edge of the atmosphere. for what it's worth, there was enough of a slight haze to obscure any real detail viewing jupiter although sharp lines could be made out on the moon, so it wasn't foggy either. i hope that gives some frame of reference as to the sky's conditions. i told some friends and emailed my mom about it this a.m. and she later found a site called myufo.com which had a sighting in st. clair shores, mi with a very similar-sounding object, also for the last night (the 27th), at 9:30p- so approximately 1 to 1-1\\2 hours before i saw. i can only believe it was the same object. although that sighting reported flashing lights on the object, which i did not see. it also reported a turtle shape and other detail but, as i said, i could not see anything but a fiery orange light. also, i would describe the shape as not really round, but not really square either. it's almost as if it were square but it was hazed over enough that i couldn't resolve even that much detail (something i hoped looking through telescope or binoculars would help with, but didn't)."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.788644,+-86.10389(7536)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7536) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Object Shape":"Egg, Fireball, Oval, Other","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Holland","There were no other sightings in Holland on or around July 27th 2007"],"Date Submitted":"07/27/2007 10:45 UTC","City":"Holland","Latitude":"42.788644","Date of the Event":"07/27/2007 10:45 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Log Number":"US-07282007-0006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7536.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7536.html"],"Longitude":"-86.10389"}
