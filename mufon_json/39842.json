Traveling on Highway 35 near exit 175 marker when I noticed a silver like cone to my left. I didn't think anything of it so I rolled down the window assuming it was glare from the window. When I did I noticed it was still there. It was around 150 feet from the ground and wasn't moving. The color was like that of a milk truck, silver like. I watched it for about 5 minutes. It lowered a bit then shot straight up in the air. This was a scary feeling as I am a skeptic and I immediately called my wife to tell her what I had seen. I was confused because my brain couldn't register what I had seen."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-06262012-0023","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39842.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39842.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 04:29 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-99.892743","City":"New Brunsfel","Case Number":"39842","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
