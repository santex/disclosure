So i ran insideand got my camera and began to tape. At first I tought it might be a silverballoon. But once it hovered to the east emitting white lites I knew it had tobe foreign. So I videotaped the whole event of the helicopter flying around itas it hovered slowly to the east and disapeared behind trees. The Object at alltimes seemed to be changing, looked like a silver saucer shaped ball that keptchanging form and has several white lites on the bottom. Amazingly I remainedcalm throught out the event and was able to get very good footage of this UFO.Im happy to say the tape speaks for itself."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Los Angeles","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"I saw and Videotaped a silver saucer shaped UFO.
