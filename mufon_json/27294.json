My sister was just walking out the door to hang out with her friends when all of a sudden she called for me frantically. I ran outside just in time to see a ball of light split into 3 balls. They hovered for about 15 seconds before going out one by one. Then everyone told me about how it had been a giant fireball. My sisters friend got at least one good photo and I got a video. Unfortunately, the video cuts out after 2 seconds. This morning my friend said the news was saying it was a skydiver with flares. I do not believe that one bit."],"Date Submitted":"01/07/2011 02:57 UTC","City":"Murrieta","Longitude":"-117.211113","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"A flaming meteorite that stopped suddenly & spread into 3 balls of light.","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.557524,+-117.211113(27294)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27294) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27294.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27294.html"]}
