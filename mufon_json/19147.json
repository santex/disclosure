The object looked to low in the sky to be a star or planet. a airplane was on a direct course with the object. The object, which was 3 to five times bigger thean the plane, then shot under the plane as if to avoid it. The object had looked as if it were in slow decent until it encountered the aircraft. It moved under the plane in an impossible manuver and then shot upward at a 45 degree angle out of sight. The object shot of in the sky and disapeared from view in less than a second."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19147.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19147.html"],"Region":"Oklahoma","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/08/2009 09:48 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09082009-0020"}
