In the background I saw several lights crossing the sky first 3-5 then 5-7 then ten or so all going in a straight line and going from right to left on the television screen. The were all losing altitude as if descending. From right to left starting at 2 oclock going to 8 oclock. I could not make out the shape of the objects. The Washington mounument was in the background. These could have been airplanes but there were just too many of them. It could also be some sort of reflection caused by cameras??? I have it saved on my DVR. If you go back to newscast at 10 or so minutes earlier it shows planes landing in background of camera?? you guys can look at video and decide. I emailed newsroom and got no response. Call my cell during day if you have any questions. At almost 12pm it was too many of them to be airplanes I think."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"12/08/2008 11:58 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.902502","Case Number":"14783","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.902502,+-77.026896(14783)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14783) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around December 8th 2008"],"Region":"District of Columbia"}
