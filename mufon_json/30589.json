It was larger than anykind of meteorite and didn't move like one. It eventually went down about a mile up road. Five minutes later another one appeared on the same path and went down in the same place. The trail led to an old out of use quarry. Upon entering and searching the quarry we found no debris or damage of any kind. However the entire quarry could not be searched as we left before moving into the second fenced off area due to hearing strange sounds and my friend insisting she was being watched."],"Region":"Scotland"}
