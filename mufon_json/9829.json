As I was facing East I noticed what seemed like a flock of birds flying in formation over hwy us 19. As I stood and watched it, it began to reveal itself as a dark traingle with about 6 white lights along the underside. I would say that the craft was about 800 ft or so above the ground and was moving directly over hwy us 19 from South to North. The speed of movement was fairly slow for aircraft,but, it would be hard for me to judge the actual speed. I aventualy lost sight of the object as it moved North and out of my view."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/02/2008 06:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9829.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9829.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/02/2008 06:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Log Number":"US-03042008-0012","Latitude":"28.18949","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Dark traiangle with 6 whites lights","City":"Holiday"}
