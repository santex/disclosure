Right where i looked up and to the north east i saw a morphing orb switching between blue white white pink white grey white colors. I felt time almost stop as i connected with the ufo. Then affer the connection ceased i wanted a closer look. I decided to run in and get my binoculars. I took two steps and was almost told to stop and look up and when i did the ufo was vanished. I grew up around an air force base and studied airplanes and got to see more then the normal kid gets to. I know of nothing like this."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47986.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47986.html"],"Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
