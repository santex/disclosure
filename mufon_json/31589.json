It appeared over some tree tops from the North East, traveled just about straight overhead, and blinked out in the South West sky approximately 35-45 degrees above the SW horizon. It traveled at a constant speed, like a satellite or space station, and never wavered. There was no contrail or smoke being emitted. No strobe or nav lights noticed and no sound. The color is what caught everyone���s attention. It was orange, and when it was overhead it did appear to be ever so lightly changing in intensity, as if it were on fire. It was also obvious it was not an aircraft since at such an angle, and as it continued away from us, the landing lights would not have been so bright or visible at all. I doubt if it was a bolide or space junk entering the atmosphere due to its constant speed and other characteristics. I have also witnessed bolides, meteors, satellites and space junk in the past due to one of my favorite pastimes, star gazing, for over 40 years."],"Case Number":"31589","City":"Rockford","Tags":"City","Region":"Illinois"}
