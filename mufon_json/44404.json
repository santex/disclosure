As I observed the object I noticed it was moving far too slowly to be an aircraft. I don't think it was a helicopter because there was absolutely no noise coming from it. It was (or appeared to be) circular in shape, it had two lights one blue and the other amber. It also had a second set of lights that rotated around the craft, those lights were white, there were several of them and when one turned on the previous one would turn off. I could be mistaken but the combination of the second set of lights and the fact that this object was silent make me doubt it was a helicopter or airplane."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Alvarado","There were no other sightings in Alvarado on or around December 7th 2012"],"Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"12/08/2012 03:21 UTC","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/07/2012 07:00 UTC","Longitude":"-97.206598","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle"}
