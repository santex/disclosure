Seeing clearly for 15 or so minutes. I was on a refreshing fresh air walk for evening. I planned to be out as long as I wanted walking in nice summer evening. I was glad to be seeing so clearly and up close an extraterrestial ship until I realized it could see me as clearly also. I felt very strongly it being a Grays ship and rushed home as quickly as I could because my fear of the Grays is huge."],"Latitude":"40.538978","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Longitude":"-112.29534","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Tooele","There were no other sightings in Tooele on or around July 19th 1993"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Utah","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19633.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19633.html"]}
