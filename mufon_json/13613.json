The helicopter had its lights right on the object and followed it closely. The object seemed to be playing cat and mouse with the helicopter and turned in the same angle as the object. The object was shiny silver and made no noise. Other helicopters in the area were also flying low. Neighbors said they saw many of these apache which must have been military. We live near the Three -mile island nuclear plant. UFO's are seen quite frequently around here. They are most reported seen at dusk when it gets dark around and down the roads of Yocumtown Road, Corn Hill Road, Valley green Road, and Lewisberry Road. Most people see orange colored lights that hover at tree top level making no sound."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"numerous people saw a apache helicopter chasing a ufo","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Etters","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.152613,+-76.750233(13613)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13613) map </A>","Case Number":"13613","Date of the Event":"11/06/2008 07:44 UTC","Log Number":"US-11092008-0007","Date Submitted":"11/06/2008 07:44 UTC","Latitude":"40.152613","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13613.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13613_submitter_file1__myufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13613.html"]}
