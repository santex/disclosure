(i'm not good with distance), it was very, very close. i got out of the car and went to the east side of the road, over the ditch and stood watching it. the object was huge, probably at least the size of a football field if it were round. it had big windows and 3 of the windows were lit. there was not one sound, the tree tops were not even swaying. there is a farm house at this location and the object was using what i would describe as search lights from the under side, moving back and forth as if searching for something. i was very excited, i waved at it, and when i did, the lights went out. my daughter was very frightened and objected to me waving at it. the object remained there about 8 minutes and then left the way it had come. it went out of sight like in a few seconds. i went home and told my husband what we'd seen and told him it would be in the news, as i couldn't possibly be the only one who saw it. it was in the news that night, but they reported that several people had seen a bright light in the sky. norad had said it was a piece of a russian satilite falling and burning to earth. i know that is a lie. i was so very close to this object and it did not fall. i did not believe in ufo's until this experience. i know now. i will never forget it."],"Date of the Event":"01/19/1989 08:00 UTC","City":"Panora"}
