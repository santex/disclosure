I was looking up at the night sky. I saw 2 shooting stars (meteorites)and continued to look around the sky for more. I noticed a point of light that I thought was moving but not quite sure. Then I noticed two more points of light traveling along with the first one. Then I noticed they were in the shape of a triangle moving together from north to south slowly. They moved without any sound for no more than 2-3 minutes and went out of sight due to trees in the yard obstructing my view. The points of light always moved together and never altered size or shape. I never saw any flashing lights and I am extremely puzzled as to what it could have been."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"three points of light in the form of a triangle moving north to south","Longitude":"-73.998466","Region":"New York","Latitude":"42.298975","Date Submitted":"05/25/2008 11:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10921.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10921.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
