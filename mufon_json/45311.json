i can not tell the truth,,should i die and take this secret to my grave? i texted my twin sister \"d\" again and told her i was bleeding to death. there was a snow storm outside but she got in her car and to my home approx 8:30 am, i bled steadily for 8hours! we headed for stephens memorial hospital in norway maine about 10 minutes from me. arrived approx 9am we arrived at the hospital,,i was so weak and gushing blood deb put me in a wheel chair and got help,, i saw a bathroom near the waiting room of er and went in to try and clean myself up. i noticed strange tissue still lingered with the blood,,flushed scared again of what i will tell the doctors. i was taken immediately to triage and left in a room, the nurse helped me undress and put me on absorbent pads on the stretcher. i waited dizzy and weak for a doctor. the er doctor came,,asked if i was pregnant i told them if i was it would be jesus,,and told him i have not had sex for 6 years. he looked like he did not believe me said we'll see ..took some blood and left.. he came back in to do an exam,,he said allot of woman come in with heavy periods fearing for nothing,,but that this in fact \"was the real deal\" i was in big trouble, my uterus was filled completely with blood,, he could not believe i had already been bleeding for 8 hours .he called the obgyn on call and said i would probably need blood,and emergency surgery. the pregnancy test returned negative..confusing the er staff even more.. dr \"c\" was the obgyn on call and came to examine me.soon after i was rushed to an emergency surgery prep room for monitoring,. dr \"c\" said she had never seen anyone lose so much blood. and that the only thing close to this much blood loss would be a mother who had a baby removed and hemorrhaged to death. she told me if i had waited any longer just a few minutes even i would be dead. she also said smoking helped save my life because smokers have more blood in their bodies. dr \"c\" then said she had to stop the bleeding and was going to try estrogen hormones. she gave me the hormones and said to give it a little time. i then was scheduled for ultrasound, but my bleeding was so bad they did not want to move me,,so the ultrasound machine came to me. after the ultrasound my blood pressure crashed as my blood supply dropped dangerously low,,i was so dizzy and scared. it was then i began having memory recall of the beings who had done this to me. people ran and got me on a stretcher,, i started having flashes of non humans. the lights were so bright,, those huge black eyes,,chaos. i closed my eyes and tried so hard to \"go somewhere else\" in my head. flashes of alien beings continued as i was rushed to surgery. they put me under and did an emergency d&c,,scraping mu uterus removing all blood clots and tissue, taking samples to be analyzed at a lab and scarring my uterus intentionally to perhaps prevent bleeding in the future. as i regained consciousnesses people were talking about how much blood i lost,, and how lucky i was to have made it there in time. i heard questioning as to why i waited 8 hours? what happened,, no one knew how and why i was bleeding to death so suddenly. dr \"c\" continued estrogen treatment. i had stopped bleeding finally through emergency surgery and hormone treatment. she has no idea why this happened . and i can not tell her.. i wish things were different, things need to change! people need to know the truth! so many questions in my head,, who did this? why did they do this,, they had never hurt me before?? what happened to me on that star craft? why hadn't they helped me?? i remained in the hospital until thursday jan 17th aprrox 4:30 pm. my sister picked me up i was hoping that the implant was removed with the fetus taken from me and had to fill a script at wall mart pharmacy,,but as soon as i walked in the alarms sounded just as they had every time since september.. as soon as i came home i called kathy marden, who has been helping me and keeping an eye on my case. in fact she came in september to speak at a conference that i put together experiencers speak on the 8th..then she came to my mothers to interview me for her new book, i remember telling her about setting of the wall mart alarm,,at that time it was only the 2nd time it had gone off,,so we laughed it off.. but it has happened every single time since. i go there allot because where i live it is the only place near by,, prescriptions,,coffee,,eye glasses,food,salon, toiletries,,etc i get everything there . so it has probably been over 100 times since sept. all the door greeters and many employees know i set the alarm system off everytime,and can not figure it out. one employee in fact made a joke saying it must be my magnetic personality! inside i knew i was pregnant, i was on my way to one of our starborn support abductee support group meetings in december and got real sick,, a sick i only felt when i was pregnant, there had been cravings and weight gain as well. i simply was in denial, and thought even if they had implanted a fetus all the cases i had heard of,,they fetus just disappears no problem.. this was not the case with me.. when i got home and called kathy marden i just broke down and cried,,i am still in a state of shock i guess,, dr \"c\" calls me daily changing my estrogen dose because if i stop i could bleed again. she is very confused ,,i so wish it was ok to speak the truth. my dream is someday it will be ok to talk about these things without being put in a straight jacket and dragged off to a mental hospital. i should never of had to feel that dying was my only solution to my problem,,i really considered taking my secret to the grave with me..during those 8 hours alone,,i thought allot about my lifetime of abductions. and why this time was so different. i am scared, confused,and desperate for answers.. sincerely, [name removed\\cms\\tg]"],"Latitude":"44.149878","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.149878,+-70.494921(45311)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45311) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01192013-0005","Longitude":"-70.494921","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45311.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/16/2013 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/19/2013 12:34 UTC","City":"Oxford","Region":"Maine","Summary":"I was abducted,, had a fetus removed,, brought back Hemorrhaging, almost bled to death,","Case Number":"45311"}
