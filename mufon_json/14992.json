We were by the campfire when my mom noticed a bright orange light coming out of the Northeast sky approximately at a 10:00 position moving south. It first was behind some low scattered clouds. It then cleared the clouds and appeared to be a bright orange fireball the size of a full moon. This object continued moving south for about 3 minutes at the same height until it reached the 1:00 position. Then the object slowed down and wavered side to side 3-5 times and suddenly vanished. My first impression was that it was a plane on fire. The object seemed so close that I feared the plane would crash into or near the campground and how will I get my family out of the camper."],"Case Number":"14992","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"The fireball came out of the northeast direction moving horizontally and moved side to side north to south and then disappeared.","Object Shape":"Fireball, Unknown","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"01/17/2009 09:35 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-80.99456","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14992.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14992.html"]}
