Noticed something making a strange contrail in sky to the west. It was vertical not horizontal and the object continued straight up until it was no longer visable. It was very strange it looked to me like a missle launch from the western sky towards KC. Just wondering if anyone else reported seeing this as well. There is no need to contact me unless someone did see it. My wife was with me as well. It was to far away to actually see what it was but it was moving slowly at first ( closer to the horizon ) and it seemed to go much faster as it went higher in the sky. It finally went so high up it went out of sight."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Missouri","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Wentzville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.81144,+-90.852911(19281)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19281) map </A>","Latitude":"38.81144","Summary":"Not UFO but looked like a missle launch","Longitude":"-90.852911"}
