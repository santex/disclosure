I thought it looked a little strange, as it was a disc shape, white and moving very slowly. I could hear no noise or see no lights. The object seemed to be flying lower than a commercial aircraft and was not shaped like, or being flown at the speed of a private jet or helicopter. There were no contrails. The object went behind a small cloud and disappeared. I took a picture on my camera phone and the object shows up as a small white disc. The resolution is not the best."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.487957"}
