I noticed a very large bright object in the sky straight ahead of us past Cairo toward Beaverdam. It was about as high in the sky as the bright planet behind us at the time (not sure which planet it was, I am guessing Venus?). I said \"whoa, what is that?\" My 9-year-old and her 10-year-old friend both noticed it as well. My 6-year-old wasn't sure what we were talking about. I stopped the vehicle in the road since there was no traffic to see if there was any movement, thinking it was possible it was an airplane with a lot of lights on it. It wasn't moving at all, and I said \"what are those lights?\" My daughter said \"they look like they are moving around it\" and then it just disappeared completely. I said \"where did it go??\" There was no cloud cover at all, all of the stars that were there were still there up above where it had been. It never moved or anything, it was as if someone turned off a switch and it was a light bulb."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cairo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Ohio","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"24033","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.086058","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06292010-0014","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unknown"}
