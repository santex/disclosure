I then down load the pictures to my computer to see if there are any unknowns. A picture taken on Aug. 8, 2008 at 12:56 PM shows what looks like a black triangle UFO. I did not see or hear the object when taking the photo. The UFO was in the NE at approximately 70 to 80 degrees elevation. The weather conditions were perfect with a blue sky and a few clouds. The object is in the upper left with a cloud above it. The top of a maple tree is in the lower left corner of the picture. There may be a prosaic explanation for the object, but it looks like a black triangle when you zoom in on it. A photo expert would need to give an authoritative opinion. The camera: Canon SD630 6.0 mega pixel I will try to attach the photo to this report. If the attachment does not occur, I will mail a hard copy to MUFON."],"Date Submitted":"08/08/2008 12:56 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"Daylight photo of a possible black triangle UFO passing overhead","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Yorktown","There were no other sightings in Yorktown on or around August 8th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12008.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12008_submitter_file1__IMG_3611.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12008_submitter_file2__Davidweliantufophoto2croped8-12-2008.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12008_submitter_file3__Davidweliantufophoto28-12-2008.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12008.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Yorktown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.173655,+-85.49414(12008)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12008) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"12008","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
