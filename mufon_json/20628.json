My wife and I noticed a bright light within the vicinity of Tower Bridge moving towards our flats. Thought it was a helicopter, but as it got closer flying West to East looked more orange and very bright. Object was moving fast. Thought it might be a Chinese lantern, but its velocity and the fact that there is only a very light breeze would discount that. As the object 'flew' over, there was no sound whatsoever. The light was very bright orange. We are used to seeing helicopters flying over London all the time and this was definately not a chopper. After passing over our flats, the object proceeded for a bit before appearing to ascend and then fade out. Within seconds a police helicopter (presumably) flew in and commenced circling the area for about 10 minutes or so before flying off West over Liverpool Street. Weather conditions were high-level overcast, very light breeze and mild. Most peculiar."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"20628","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"11/20/2009 05:39 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.510229,+-0.123025(20628)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20628) map </A>","City":"London","Latitude":"51.510229","Tags":"City","Summary":"Bright Orange Light Moving Fast- West to East Over City of London Followed By Helicopter Circling Where It Dissapeared","Date of the Event":"11/20/2009 10:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"05:00:00","Country":"United Kingdom","Object Features":"None, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20628.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20628.html"],"Longitude":"-0.123025","Region":"England","Log Number":"GB-11202009-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
