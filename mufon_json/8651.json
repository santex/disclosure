The witness grabbed her binoculars and ran out to see two objects, both round and red on the bottom but blue and white in the body. Both were emitting what appeared to be strobes of light which were ���crooked like lighting���. The objects moved in whirling, zig-zagging, and S movements as they advanced very slowly toward the west northwest. The smaller of the two objects, which seemed to be farther away, appeared to be over the Intercoastal Waterway. After 45 minutes, the objects were covered by clouds and were not visible to the witnesses."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/19/2007 09:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Riviera Beach","There were no other sightings in Riviera Beach on or around December 19th 2007"],"Log Number":"US-12232007-0003","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/19/2007 09:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Riviera Beach","Latitude":"26.77534","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-80.058097","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8651.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8651.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Florida"}
