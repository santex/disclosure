I saw what appeared to be a star falling then it sped fast and disappeared. It then dawned on me stars don't fall horizontal. The object was bright had colors of Orange and White. I saw a plane or helicopter a few minutes before. This object caught my eye because it was brighter, I thought it was plane than a falling star, it appeared to be falling but then it sped up up and disappeared. The object was traveling west. I have never seen anything like it. I am trying to describe it, but am not doing a good job. I did read a post from someone in Miniesota, the post was from today. It is pretty much exactly what I saw the only different the object moved west shot off and disappeared. i am no wscko, I really did see something. I am a believer of UFOs, and believe that is what I saw.
