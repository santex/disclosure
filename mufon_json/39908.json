When it finally was roaring i noticed a blue light with a blue ring of light or reflection around it through tree openings above me it seemed different from any air craft ive seen at night, it vanish behind the tree after i watched it go by for about 20 seconds. And I thought about ufos and felt almost as if i were being watched so i high tailed it out of there and ending up going closer to disney to watch fireworks. As the show went on i noticed the blue light again in the distance, near the fireworks! (funny as this was the direction it seemed to be heading earlier) It floated motionless and looked somewhat like the top of a tower, but a plane came near it and the blue light vanished, I did not see it again."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"28.42696","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
