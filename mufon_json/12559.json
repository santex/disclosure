Event: ��� When: About a year ago���maybe October of 07. ��� What doing: I was flying a commercial jet from South Florida to Atlanta up the coast. I am a private pilot and like to sit by the window when I fly to watch. It was a very clear day about mid morning and I was watching the terrain and a few fishing boats. We were flying just over the land so I had a good view of where the water met the land. ��� Where: we were up in the area of the Gulf coast that is not yet totally build up. Maybe half way between Tampa and Panama City. ��� I first noticed two fighter jets. Not an expert on make and model but maybe F-16s? They were executing what looked like a turn heading mostly south and some east. Maybe turning back around. They were pretty low���guessing 8,000 feet or lower. We were perhaps 35,000 feet? ��� I wondered what they were doing there���.I was watching intently and suddenly saw an object that was submerged. It was very large as compared with the few boats I���d seen. The difference was the boats made a wake and this clearly didn���t. It was clearly not on the surface. Even more interesting was how rapidly it was moving. I could judge relative speed from the speed of the jets. The object was moving more south and to the west���toward deeper gulf. ��� From what I could see and compared to the relative speed of the fighter jets, it was moving about ��� their speed. I had no way to determine exact speed but I was assuming the jets were moving at 500 MPH or so or at a normal cruise speed. ��� I could also judge its relative speed from the water craft that was visible which created wakes���the boats were standing still in comparison. ��� I couldn���t imagine how something could move that fast underwater. ��� I kept my eye on it for as long as I could but we were flying but as we were flying in a northerly direction I was soon out of view. ��� I really wanted to know (1) what that was (2) were those jets actually tracking it (3) what could move so rapidly under water and I realized, I���d never hear or read or find out���a shame. ��� When I saw your site, I thought I might as well report it. Maybe it will mean something to someone. ��� That���s it."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","City":"between Tampa and Panama","Longitude":"-81.513894","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12559.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12559.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/17/2008 06:44 UTC","Date of the Event":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.667877,+-81.513894(12559)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12559) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"12559","Latitude":"27.667877","trends":["There have been no other sightings in between Tampa and Panama","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"USO being pursued by fighter jets off North Florida Gulf coast","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
