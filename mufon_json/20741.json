About a week ago whenever that meteor shower was going on, me and my friend were laying down on a soccer field looking at the sky trying to see the meteors and all that. Then we saw a weird square looking thing. The weird thing about it was that I dont remember any lights on it (but my friend claims that it had a orange light) but I could still clearly see it. It was flying in a choppy zig zag path. Really weird... It did like 3 zig zags with a pause in between each one, and then shot off extremely fast. Just vanished. The crazy thing was the next morning in my biology lab I overheard a girl a couple tables down talking about seeing a weird thing flying in the sky, I immediately jumped in and said I saw it too. Weirdest thing I have ever seen. Have you heard any other stories like this?"],"Region":"Delaware","Summary":"Black zig zag fast choppy","Longitude":"-75.744587","City":"Newark","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.688373","Date of the Event":"11/18/2009 02:45 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20741.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20741.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11262009-0013","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.688373,+-75.744587(20741)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20741) map </A>"}
