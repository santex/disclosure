We are used to seeing aircraft in the area as our town has a small airport. However, the flashing was far too bright for the usual craft and emitted colors we have not seen including a turquoise, purple and even green as I was watching. It hovered in the treeline for approximately 4 minutes and moved out of the treeline. This is still at 10:16 pm Central Standard time, ongoing. The object is slow moving appearing to move closer to our location and recede slightly. Movement is not always slow but not entirely erratic either. It seems to be moving (at best guess) in a spiral motion. There are three witnesses in our household. I cannot attest to the neighborhood, as it is fairly quiet and others seem to be indoors. I am attempting to get photos and will be happy to send them to you once I have anything confirmed. At this point, I don't know how clear they will be."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Gladewater","There were no other sightings in Gladewater on or around December 8th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.525012,+-94.967041(26904)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26904) map </A>"}
