As we were on our way to a childs birthday party i wasn't suprised to see what i thought was a ballon floating over the neiborhood of Talega. Then I thought no it's to big and i pointed it out to my wife saying half jokingly \"oh look theres a ufo\" and just as i said that it stopped moving higher and began to fall slowly at fist and the very quickly and as it moved down it began to look more like a boomerang than a ballon. Then it looked like it stopped falling but just dissapeared. I told my wife to stop but she said she couldn't because there was someone behind us,and thats it, i scanned the clear blue sky the rest of the afternoon but never saw it again. This is the third ufo i think i've seen but the first one i ever reported."],"Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in San Clemente","There were no other sightings in San Clemente on or around March 24th 2007"],"Disposition":"IFO"}
