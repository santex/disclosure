It immediately caught my attention because of the size and speed. Once the object passed the moon I realized it was actually two separate objects. The one in front was a large spherical amber colored orb. The second was two pulsating red orbs flying below the first at a 45 degree angle. They appeared to be no more than 30 feet apart. They appeared to be at an altitude less than 1000 feet. They were totally silent and slowly changed direction making an arching path passed my house. They then proceeded in a north west direction. Once the objects were passed my location, the red orbs climbed evenly with the amber orb. They then kept this formation until out of sight."],"Region":"Tennessee","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.888808","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/24/2010 10:07 UTC","Log Number":"US-10242010-0015","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
