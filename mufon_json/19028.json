cannot yet provide a specific date as i was very young but i am working on narrowing this down a bit. i am currently located in oregon but will be back in indiana around early october, where the incident originally occurred. i remember playing just outside the house on the patio while my mother was in the adjacent kitchen. i was not allowed to wander too far if she was not with me. i saw a white-ish\\metallic \"airplane\" as i knew it then, because anything in the sky was an airplane at that age. i don't know where it came from or how long it had been there observing me if it in fact was. it made no sound so i only noticed it when it became very close. linear distance from me was probably around 100ft away and the height at which it was hovering was maybe only 20-feet above a large tree in the neighbors yard that it passed directly over. i recall being fascinated by this because at that age i was afraid of the loud sound airplane and jet engines made and would always run inside or hide next to my parents when a traditional aircraft flew near of any sort. this craft made no sound, literally no sound, so i was happy to be able to watch an \"airplane\" up close for the very first time. i wasn't frightened at all and enjoyed the event. as it continued at what i would say was a brisk walking pace it eventually crossed over the rural road and continued over an open field. at that time i saw what i remember to be a ball-shaped object fall from the bottom of the craft and land in the field. it fell at about the speed any object that was dropped would fall, no slower or faster than gravity. i moved towards the ball and do not again remember seeing the craft unfortunately, i think i was fixated on picking up part of the \"airplane\". i know this was real and not a dream or otherwise because to this day i remember the feeling of anxiety in my stomach, not from the object but from crossing the road by myself, something i was never allowed to do at that age, not even to get the mail. i realized i wasn't supposed to cross the road but my curiosity was overwhelming. i easily found it, walked up and leaned down to see it closer but have no further recollection of the object and only remember being back on the patio after an unknown amount of time, tho i know it wasn't much later because it wasn't noticeably darker and my mother wasn't worried about me. i believe i was very young because i knocked on the glass door rather than open it myself, and when my mother slid it open i anxiously told her i saw an airplane and part of it came off. she humored me for a moment and brought me inside and the event was forgotten. the craft itself was very smooth, i consider it an oval or ellipse, but i have never seen another image of a craft like this one in any ufo shows or photos i have seen. i say it was different because it had what i later associated as looking most like an antennae mast from an aircraft carrier. if you haven't seen one of those, it's a large antennae array with many smaller pieces sticking out in all directions, jumbled and looking somewhat unorganized which contrasted with the otherwise smooth and sleek profile of the object. later i had several experiences seeing silhouetted figures in my bedroom door way, and on one occasion i know i tried to scream out to my parents only to feel the attempt being made, but no sound was coming out. i then passed out, or fell asleep somehow. the second time i saw a figure was just the silhouette but this time it didn't scare me for some reason and i was much older, probably a teenager. i just stared at it as it faced me, then again fell asleep quickly for whatever reason. i never thought much of this until one night in my 20's when a friend of a friend asked if i ever saw ufo's or aliens and i said \"no\", but said that i would give anything if i could have since both of my sisters had sightings in their lives. he further questioned if i ever saw any object of any sort or person i couldn't explain which instantly reminded me of these events that had long been forgotten as trivial. suddenly, through the scope of adulthood, i realized no airplane looks or behaves like that craft, and when questioned, my parents had no explanation for the figures in the house. i apologize for not leaving my full details as of yet, but i am unclear as to who the \"third parties\" are that may contact me with my approval. i would be willing to provide more detail upon clarification and i authorize mufon to contact me directly at the email address provided for said clarification, thank you. in fact, i would welcome information to help me solve this lifelong riddle. my sisters may be willing to provide their stories as well, but that would be up to them. i plan to question my parents if they ever had any sightings when i return to indiana. i will be residing in the house where the incident happened when i do get back. i did find a drawing i made later in life of the craft as i was packing, but it is likely in a moving box at present and i won't have access to it again until october when i complete my move."],"Case
