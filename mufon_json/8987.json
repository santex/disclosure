I am a professional business person in my mid 50's. I have a picture and information that you will be very interested in at the least. This in fact may be what you have been looking for. I am afraid of the overall situation and where I think it may lead. I have told my wife that I will try to forget about again starting next week. I have met with the grandson of James Forrestal recently if that tells you anything. My research has lead me to a very frightening conclusion. If you want to discuss this before I change my mind please call me right away. Sincerely, Chris"],"Summary":"See detailed description","Longitude":"-82.901223","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8987.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8987.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"07/10/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.426957,+-82.901223(8987)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8987) map </A>","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.426957","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/10/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"8987"}
