Directly above and SE of moon, we saw a star-like or satellite type of object moving quickly across the sky. There was also on coming from the other direction and moving SW. They almost collided, switched direction and both stopped and hovered. There were red, white and bluish lights going around it and flashing on and off. No less than 8 - 10 little flashing lights came out and darted away from the first and larger one. They would disappear, reappear and go back into the first one. The larger one started moving up into the sky and then stopped again. I came inside after observing for approx. 10 minutes. It was pretty exciting and I knew we were seeing something that was no a plane, satellite or star. My neck became sore and that is why I came inside."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.112961,+-121.286189(42165)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42165) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42165.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42165.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"42165","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/29/2012 09:20 UTC","Summary":"Watching Blue Moon.
