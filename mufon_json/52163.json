{"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-84.152431","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was just standing in my backyard one afternoon and looked up and saw a sliver craft moving from north to south. It was pretty high and had no wings, made no noise. I thought it might be a balloon but seemed to be moving under its own power in a straight line. It had a definite circular shape that I could see and it was metallic with a dome. I have attached a sketch of the shape."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"11/10/2013 10:07 UTC","Case Number":"52163","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52163.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52163.html"],"Log Number":"US-11102013-0014","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.417898,+-84.152431(52163)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52163) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Tallahassee","There were no other sightings in Tallahassee on or around July 15th 2011"],"Country":"United States","City":"Tallahassee","Latitude":"30.417898","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Dome","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/15/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"It was just slowly moving across the sky from north to south"}
