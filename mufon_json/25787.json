They did not appear to be airplanes because no navigation lights were seen.The color of the objects were star like and a bright orange.I have observed many type of aircraft military and civilian and have never seen anything fly at that speed and make course changes so severe.I estimate a total of 10-12 objects seen, then disapeared.Watched sky for another 10 minutes or so nothing else seen. I hope someone else besides my wife and myself saw this and can explain.Very interesting."],"trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Cabo San Lucas","There were no other sightings in Cabo San Lucas on or around October 9th 2010"],"Country":"Mexico","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"orange bright light approx 10-12 objects flying in a irreagular formation.","Latitude":"22.891633","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
