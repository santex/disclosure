They were visible for a few seconds, then disappeared, then reappeared as a reflection kinda like mylar balloons, then disappeared, and reappeared again as a reflective group. Kinda like the way the sunlight reflects on fish scales. Perfectly cloud free sky, object appeared and disappeared several times as it moved slowly from sse to nnw. First thought it was a flock of birds, then thought maybe a group of mylar balloons, but it was much bigger than either of these. Object has been observed several times by members of my family. It slowly moves across the sky coming in and out of sight either as lights or a reflection from the sun, then totally disappears."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","City":"Schertz"}
