My wife noticed a weird orange orb of light in the sky moving very slowly. It had absolutley no blinking lights, it looked just like a ball of orange light, bigger than a star, bigger than an airplane and it just slowly moved overhead, within minutes of it dispearing ( whether it disapeared or moved far enough away that we couldnt see it ) a helicopter followed in the same direction the light went. we had absolutely no idea what the light was, it did not fit any template of what we would consider to be seen flying slowly over an area. when we first saw it i turned down a side street and pulled over and we watched it until it slowly got smaller and disappeared ( probably from distance it went)"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Winnipeg","There were no other sightings in Winnipeg on or around October 5th 2010"],"Country":"Canada","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25743.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25743.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.901094,+-97.133334(25743)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25743) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
