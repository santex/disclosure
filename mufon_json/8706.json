I thought at the time how beautiful it was and on Christmas Day. The only way I can really describe this light is to compare it to a brake light on vehicle in a pitch dark sky. It was slightly larger than an aspirin at arm's length and was mostly disc-shaped but blurred around it's edges. It was there for a few seconds, then just disappeared or blinked-out. It was not an airplane, helicopter or normal air traffic to or from the airport which is just a few miles from where I live, I've seen enough of those in my life to know that it wasn't 'normal' traffic. It had no flashing lights of any kind, just a bright red glow."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.108196,+-94.574417(8706)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8706) map </A>","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were no other sightings in Kansas City on or around December 25th 2007"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8706.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8706.html"],"City":"Kansas City","Region":"Missouri","Longitude":"-94.574417","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
