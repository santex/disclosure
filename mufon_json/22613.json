Both moved up and down for about an hour as a watched it. I noticed the first which was situated north of Morrison, CO before sun down. It seemed to bright to be a star so I watched it further. It first was just above the ridge line then moved up and stood still for about an hour. Right after the first sighting a second one south of the first appeared even brighter and moved up then disappeared doing this 3 times as the first stayed in place. About a half hour after the sightings there were jets of some sort (military?) flying around circling about a 10 mile radius. More jets appeared shortly after. These were without a doubt a phenomenon and am now convinced. Even more so as I saw 4 jets flying in circles around that area during and after the event. I was at work (delivery driver) so I never managed to take photos and when I got home they had already disappeared. Someone must have witnessed this event. It was obvious."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Morrison","Weather Factors":"Windy","Date of the Event":"04/01/2010 07:40 UTC","Case Number":"22613","Log Number":"US-04012010-0027","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.662029,+-105.18661(22613)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22613) map </A>","Summary":"2 Light orbs/ufo over Morrison area","Region":"Colorado"}
