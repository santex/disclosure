It left a tail behind it similar to what a comet would. It was moving slower than a meteor or airplane, but still moved pretty quickly. The object made no noise that we could hear. There were no blinking lights either. I tried to capture on video on my Blackberry, but the object was indistinguishable on it. The other observer suggested it may be one of those luminary bags that you light and let off, but it stayed up and travelled horizontally across the sky for approximately 5 minutes until it went behind the trees and we could no longer see it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.15477,+-74.913572(33229)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33229) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/07/2011 08:08 UTC"}
