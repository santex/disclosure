At first just saw a couple then over a period of a couple weeks started seeing more. Now the are in triangle formations. there have hardly moved in three months there are at least 12 of them now. Can see them ever night they are noticeable before the stars are. There flash in colors at same time. I love to go out and watch them. My son Koty said he thinks they are so cool to watch flash. We wish we had a better telescope to see them better. you can see the color change with your bare eyes. I do not have a camera that can get a picture that far away."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.15735,+-86.266614(32183)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32183) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Watervliet","There were no other sightings in Watervliet on or around September 29th 2011"],"Summary":"Flashing lights now in formations","City":"Watervliet","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-09292011-0013","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/29/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Region":"Michigan","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32183.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32183.html"]}
