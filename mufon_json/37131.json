The sky was perfectly clear. I call my grlfriend to come out and it started moving south for a minute real slow and then east and then west and stopped. It's been about 20 minutes now and it's still there. Pretty darn weird. Wish i knew what it was. Can't be space station and I'm pretty sure satelites down move around and then stay in same place. Tried video taping but the moon is so bright its not coming up."],"Date of the Event":"04/04/2012 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Bellmawr","There were no other sightings in Bellmawr on or around April 4th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","City":"Bellmawr","Date Submitted":"04/04/2012 10:48 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.871413,+-75.087518(37131)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37131) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37131.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37131.html"],"Longitude":"-75.087518","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Yellowish light in space changing direction the stopping.","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Latitude":"39.871413"}
