I thought it might be a couple of balloons, and it might be, but the thing stayed in the exact same spot for about twenty minutes before moving north. Sorry for the shaky camera, it's tough to focus when you're zooming that far and I didn't have a tripod. No sound, so I didn't record any."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
