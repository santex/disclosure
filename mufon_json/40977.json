We have an observatory 3 miles away at UNM, The ABQ Sunport and Kirtland AFB are within 6 miles of my sighting, so someone other than me and my wife had to of seen it; I don't drink or do drugs and I am not apt to seeing things or have an overactive imagination even though it started to make me think about the movie: War of the Worlds."]}
