Extending the arm with the finger & thumb spaced at 2 in. apart was the apparent length. The opaque green object was hovering stationary not far above the tree line which is 500 ft away. It also had a row of 5 near white lights in a horizontal row in the lower half of the craft that would blink in sequence, 1,2,3,4,5 than all out, 1 2 3 4 5 , all out, etc from left to right.The lights were large enough to see easily but more like marker lights than spot lights. After thinking this was highly unusual she returned to bed without noticing any change in movement or appearance."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/01/2012 02:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
