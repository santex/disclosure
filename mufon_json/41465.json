It was very dark and hard to tell altitude. Absolutely silent. In perfect synchronicity. I never really thought UFO until I saw some of the TV programs . The descriptions of the pie shaped crafts others have seen really brought it home. I don't know if there were any other sightings around this time and area or not but I thought it might be worth letting you know. Also check in 1999. I am not positive of the year or month."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41465.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41465.html"]}
