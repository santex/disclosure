I looked up and saw a white light that was moving rapidly back and forth and got my husband to look up. It changed from white to blue a couple times and then it stayed blue. We couldn't see it the whole time due to trees and houses but it would pop out from behind them and zig zag. It would also go up and down. It was moving to quickly to be some kind of plane and it was pretty bright. We watched it for about 20 minutes before we went up a flight of stairs to the third floor landing of our building and could see it much better however shortly after that it didn't come out anymore. It was near Bear Creek Lake Park or possibly bandimere speedway."],"City":"Morrison","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-105.18682","Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"29182","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29182.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29182.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/21/2011 11:03 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
