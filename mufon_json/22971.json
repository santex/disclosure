It is too close, it moves, and is gone in 90 min.","Log Number":"US-04262010-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Richmond","There were no other sightings in Richmond on or around April 25th 2010"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approx. 8:30p.m. nightly, a very bright starlike object appears in the sky. It moves rapidly into position, then it hovers for 60-90 minutes with a back and forth horizontal motion. It pulsates and is soundless. The motion isn't great but its constant and discerenable; maybe half of my pinky finger's width at arms length. This bright light appears at the same time as the multicolored star sphere that I had reported before. Toniht both appeared at the same time and as I am typing this report the bright light has moved away and the multicolored sphere lingers. I showed my wife tonight. She usually dismisses it as a bright star, but even she agreed it was too close and too bright and moved. She refused to speculate; only to witness. I took 4 pictures, but due to the poor quality of my Olympus camera, I was unable to capture anything more than a light trail, which I deleted."],"Case Number":"22971","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"04/26/2010 12:31 UTC","Region":"California","City":"Richmond","Latitude":"37.943998","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.343309","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/25/2010 08:30 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.943998,+-122.343309(22971)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22971) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown"}
