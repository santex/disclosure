{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approximately 11:25 3 objects forming a triangle in flight pattern flew over Kings Park NY from the Southwest to the Northeast. They were not like regular aircraft as they made no sound and were a glowing orange color - they were at a lower altitude as they were rather large. They flew in a path like jets but glowed orange. Within 1 minute another group of two flew in the same direction as the first three - toward Long Ialand Sound."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.911391,+-73.249049(31497)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31497) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/03/2011 11:25 UTC","Summary":"5 glowing Orange balls - like aircraft - 2 groups 3 and then 2","Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"40.911391","Date Submitted":"09/04/2011 12:02 UTC","Longitude":"-73.249049","Log Number":"US-09042011-0001","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"31497","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Kings Park","There were no other sightings in Kings Park on or around September 3rd 2011"],"City":"Kings Park","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31497.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31497.html"]}
