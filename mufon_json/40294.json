It traveled from east to west. Stopped north about light house field. It hovered at a high altitude and stayed stationary. Three engines were clearly viewable. Planes started to come in from the west and the object exited the atmosphere in a straight vertical lift till the engines were no longer visible. The object was in the sky for approximately 5 minutes. No sound was heard and no alcohol was involved. I cannot believe that there weren't other people who saw it as well."],"Object Features":"Dome"}
