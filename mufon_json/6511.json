Its not a star. It is about at cloud level and you can see it long before it is dark out. I suspect there is a second one on the other side of the city but not sure what the second object is. This is obviously an ongoing thing. I have been informed someone in this department might have some clue as to what it is. The first time I saw it I noticed it was infront of clouds so hence in our gravity range yet everyone I have pointed it out to thinks its a star or planet. I have seen this thing through a telescope and it looks nothing like the stars do. Through the telescope it looks like a flat object shooting different colors of light out of all sides of it. Ok to answer the questions to the left, when I first saw it I thought it was the light of a jet until I realized it wasnt moving at all. We were headed in the direction of Cook Inlet to go to a restaurant."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"63.595693","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"daily reoccurring star like object that can be seen way before stars can"}
