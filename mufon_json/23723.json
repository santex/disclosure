I was 10, and we had just finished playing the games you play at slumber parties such as levitation. We were all looking out over Lake Washington and watched a light about the size of a star. We could tell the light was getting closer to the window as it got larger. It then retreated, zig zagged across the sky at a high rate of speed then disappeared. Never told anyone about this. I'd be interested to know if there were any other reports in this area around this time. Thanks for your time, Tamara P.S. I don't want my info released at this time, but MUFON is welcome to contact me. Just keep in mind the time difference from where you are to Guam. Thanks again"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23723.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23723.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"23723","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/31/1970 12:00 UTC"}
