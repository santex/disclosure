I being a sceptic in this area have been left completely unable to explain this event. my partner and i both spent half the night trying to explain away the event and make sense of it. being unable to do that i have a whole different look on this area now and as interesting as it is i find it hard to wrap my mind around it. this event changed my whole outlook."],"City":"Martinez","Date of the Event":"10/31/2010 11:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"star like redish light tranformed to a flarelike fire ball and transferred back to tight redish light.","Date Submitted":"11/01/2010 12:34 UTC","Case Number":"26275"}
