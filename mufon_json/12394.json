I did not see the discs until I was zooming in on the photographs to see the detail. Both objects seem disc-like and shiny. I seem to be having a fair number of recent sightings and am so glad to have captured these on digital media, even though I did not notice them at the time. These were taken the middle of the first week in september in North Central Texas. The photos were taken with a Sony Cybershot 7.2 megapixel camera on automatic settings. I also noticed that another person from NCT, very near by has also submited a report with photos of similar object."],"Summary":"Dayligt photos of shiny discs in clouds","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/04/2008 02:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12394.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12394_submitter_file1__WebWeb073croppedwithinsert.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12394_submitter_file2__WebUFOatsunset.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12394_submitter_file3__new073_ud.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12394.html"]}
