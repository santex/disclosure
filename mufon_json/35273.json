As we were half way into the flight, aprox 11am to 12 noon, I looked out the window and observed a cigar shaped object that was aprox 5 to 8 miles away & seemed to be aprox 3 to 4 football fields long, silver outer shaped along with darker features inside of the shape. I rubbed my eyes, kept seeing it for 5 seconds, then I turned to the man sitting next to me and said \"look, do you see that\"? He looked out and said no! As I looked back out, it was gone!I was jut relaxing at the time, just looking out the window from time to time,It was so large, that's why I noticed it. I know when I saw it it was not of this world as I was in the U.S. Navy & worked on Aircraft & worked for the DOD and Government Contractors! It was stationary didn't seem to move. I was excited! and nervous!Lost sight when I turned to the man in the seat next to me. I really hope someone else reported the same type of object on the same day, time, and location. please direct me where to go to find out that info, thank you!"],"City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01262012-0023","Date of the Event":"12/19/2011 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Object Shape":"Cigar","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-111.092261","Summary":"I flew to Atlanta Airport from Los Angeles, aprox half way there I looked out the window & observed a cigar shaped object","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Arizona","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.057988,+-111.092261(35273)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35273) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":[],"Country":"United States"}
