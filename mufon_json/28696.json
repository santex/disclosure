We thought is was a jet but it was moving faster than anything we have ever seen. It was not very high at all. When it got closer the arching light was big multi colored and bright It slowed down and vanished into nothing,after about a second or two it appeared again for about two to three seconds then was gone. This was so amazing but scary. I called the news 10 desk and the girl that answered was not very interested.She did say that she had calls from Lakeside,Santee and El Cajon. I have never seen anyting like this in my life. Did anyone get video? If so please post it on you tube. Regards,"]}
