{"Case Number":"13052","divs":["sighting detailsi was moving a mattress into my house with the help of my father, and i happened to be looking up at the sky when i was doing it and saw a bright star light object moving slowly from north west to the south east. i had a recent experience with a similar object less than three months before, so i watched it, but did not bring it up to my father, who is skeptical of the phenomena. it was moving slowly, and had a steady yellowish glow to it. there were no strobes or navigation lights that i could see, although i could see several other strobes of aircraft in the same area (a few miles in the distance). the sky was perfectly clear and i could see lots of stars(my house is in a small town). after about 3-5 minutes, the object vanished. prior to it vanishing it was in my clear sight, about 40 degrees above horizon. it appeared to be the same type of light i had seen before in my previous report (08\\05\\2008 - benson, nc), and in the same area as the object i saw before (about 7-10 miles from where my house is)."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.414759,+-78.667639(13052)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13052) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.414759","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13052.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13052.html"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/06/2008 08:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Coats","There were no other sightings in Coats on or around October 6th 2008"],"Summary":"Saw bright, star-light object move slowly across the sky, and the disappear suddenly","City":"Coats","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Region":"North Carolina","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Longitude":"-78.667639","Date Submitted":"10/06/2008 08:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-10142008-0018","Weather Factors":"None"}
