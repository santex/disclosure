(i'm a little bummed to realize today that i could've had a 12.1mp photo during recording if i had pressed the photo button....sigh). i'm soooooo excited!!!!!! we've seen many different kinds of unidentified flying objects (vertical rod, neon green & orange fireballs, red pulsating disk, star-like bright round ones, comet type horizontal flying one, huge cigar with probes, a neon green light orb in iowa, a v-shaped one, a smaller oblong silver one, and a small, softball-to-soccer ball-sized silver orb, but this one takes the cake!) go ahead, look at the video and blow ups and say it with me....\"what the hell is it???!!\" update: video presentation done with blown-up stills in slow-motion playback. video is untouched, stills only had 'sharpen' and\\or brightness\\contrast adjusted to see detail. posted on my youtube channel (plus enjoy my pre-screened \"favorites\" videos--all are impressive non-fake ones), at: www.youtube.com\\seeingufospa oh yeah, i copyrighted all the images so i could possibly get compensated for my lack of sleep and equipment costs. it's only fair. all rights reserved and all that stuff...."],"City":"Murrysville","Region":"Pennsylvania","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.431672,+-79.691945(17101)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17101) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.431672","Tags":"City"}
