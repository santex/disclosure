On my right a very bright light appeared, pulsating and moving fast away. With the naked eye only the very bright light was visible en the field arround it seemed effected like clouds moving away. I was sure it was no airplane or drone, i know how they move and what they look like, we see those often here too. My camera was just around the door, since it is there standby for the cloud pictures i often make. Before i had my camera and came back, in about 10 seconds it was nearly out of sight already, but i tried to photographe it anyway. Later on i enlarged and could see this object with the light."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50180_submitter_file1__P1140149.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50180_submitter_file2__P1140154.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50180_submitter_file3__Fellicht23aug2013.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/50180_submitter_file4__P1140150.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50180.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Gorinchem","Source":"MUFON"}
