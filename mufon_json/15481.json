I seen a long light in the sky and said the moon sure is weird tonite and had to look twice to see what it was. It was diamond shape with a triangular red - blue lights around it it kept twinkling like the stars then i really watched it kept moving westernly then after i got in the van and had to check that out and followed it not too far it just disappeared. I never saw anything like that and we see eveything here being underneath a flight path area you see all kinds and hear it too. But not this i thought it really was the moon it was so bright, my Pete kept sayin that thing is really low and it must be a plane. By this time I want some explanations. But get nothing but what the heck was that.
