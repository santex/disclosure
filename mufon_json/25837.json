{"Object Shape":"Egg, Fireball","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:08","Region":"Nova Scotia","Latitude":"46.14497","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas on computer reading about the world news on the cnn page lastnight around 11:30pm,when I decided to look out the front door which is beside the desk I was sitting at,and all of a sudden an Eggshape Fireball appeared in the treetops at low altitude and flew very fast from one end to the other,id say within 8 seconds or less. Extremely fast object.This is the 4th night in a row that I have been seeing strange objects flying fast in the sky.A few nights ago I also seen a light so fast that left the rainbow colors in the dead of night dark red,purple,and I think a strange golden yellow were present,Went so fast I was unable to see how many colors were actually in it..It also had 4 trails,not just one trail following behind that one.So four colors.Decided to report because It seems this is becoming an every night thing.The nights are colder now and the sky has been very clear here in Cape Breton,I have a very large view of the sky from my area.very open and rural.Is it me or is something about to take place we don't know about?Because It is very busy up there I must say. I do not like reporting much because I reported a story on this website in the past,and the night after I posted an abduction story a black helicopter flew over the house at middle morning around 2:30 am, with a very bright red light attached to the end that did not blink.I heard the helicopter loud and clear because I was on this site reading other stories at the time.And it was defensibly military,and I live in Canada remember not the US.I truly think this website is monitored in some way by some sort of agency,And I think that the black helicopter phenom may be connected with Stealth monitoring programs in some way or another..I don't really know,but just a warning."],"Summary":"Eggs Hape FireBall appears as soon as I look out door,and is looking as if on fire with long tail trailing behind","Country":"Canada","Case Number":"25837","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.14497,+-60.185864(25837)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25837) map </A>","Log Number":"CA-10122010-0008","City":"Sydney","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25837.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25837.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/13/2010 11:25 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-60.185864","Date Submitted":"10/12/2010 10:42 UTC","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Sydney","There were no other sightings in Sydney on or around October 13th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
