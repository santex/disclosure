At first I did not think anything of it thinking that it may just be a plane but it had no blinking lights and it did not appear that it was on approach. As I got closer to the airport the object seemed to have been in the same exact place as I first saw it just over the horizon facing the city. Minutes later as i got to the airport it was still in the same place and when I turned around to take a picture of it the object was no longer there."],"Region":"Pennsylvania"}
