Walking to my car. Saw this object fly at a sharp angle, downward to the horizon in a straight line at a 45 degree angle. The object looked to emit white, bright light with a glowing red tail. I first thought it was a shooting star. The speed was slower then shooting stars I've seen in the past, it also looked to be closer. Because it was closer then a shooting star it looked to be like a very \"big\" star. Then then I saw it disappear beyond the horizon."],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Date of the Event":"10/22/2013 07:56 UTC","Case Number":"51755","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Glowing white star like object with red tail.","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Auburn","There were no other sightings in Auburn on or around October 22nd 2013"],"Date Submitted":"10/22/2013 11:50 UTC"}
