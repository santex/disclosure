Me and my girlfriend saw a strange thing near hannover. It was clear sky. I saw this thing (see picture) in the sky... It was about twice the size of the moon (as seen from earth). During the next minute it moved from right to left a distance about three times of its size. Then it faded away, without getting smaller. Well I don���t belive in ufo���s or such things, and so i don���t think that was one. But, i���m really curious what it was, so maybe someone here has an idea... thanks Manuel"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Niedersachsen","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"12379","Date Submitted":"09/05/2008 08:00 UTC","Log Number":"DE-09072008-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.394089,+9.736391(12379)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12379) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12379.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12379_submitter_file1__wtf.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12379.html"],"Summary":"Strange Thing in the Sky","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Hanover"}
