The object was always at an angle. I was driving in my car, thinking I would get closer and see what this was. I thought it was something on fire or some weird flares. Sometimes the object would completely disappear. When I finally got to a clearing in the road I did not see anything. When I got closer to my home I could see the two balls of light off and on. They would just dissappear. It would hover over the Lake of the Ozarks. One ball dropped in the woods like a falling star. I called my husband then very concerned. I got out of my car to see better and I could go no further on the snow packed road with my car. I saw three lights connected at one point. I had my husband walk up our drive to where I was at. He shined a flash light and the lights in the sky dissapeared completely. We walked back home, even though I wanted to stay and get a picture. When we got home, I showed him two bright lights that looked like stars hovering over a cove. We could see them from our deck overlooking the lake. He said they were stealth planes. They flared up and took off, they then returned and when I shined a flash light at them they completely dissappeared. Can stealths turn off their lights like that? These last objects were completely different than what I had seen earlier. The later were farther away in the sky, the first objects that looked like fireballs were close by over the woods and over the lake."],"Date Submitted":"01/13/2010 01:25 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Rocky Mount","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.324196,+-92.665188(21472)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21472) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Rocky Mount","Longitude":"-92.665188","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21472.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21472.html"],"Summary":"two connected fireballs hovering low in sky through woods","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.324196","Case Number":"21472","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
