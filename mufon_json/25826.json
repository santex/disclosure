Not sure if it's man made or a planet. My mother notice it as well, and a friend and we were all wondering. It's very bright, looks like a diamond shape and points come out from it, its really blinding if you really look at it. If it's a star, it's really big! Also it moves, left to right. It starts out up the street from me and then moves to the center then to the end of street, then makes a left up another street. It's there most of the time, some times its not. It's still going on. Sometimes it's gone for a week and then shows back up and stays around for a week, sometimes longer. Also it's white and shines off blue in the center of it. I see it when I take my dogs out, and the nights my mother picks me up. I thought it was the space station, but when I heard on the news you could only see it on their day mentioned, I was like, well guess it's not what I'm seeing. Because I'm seeing it all week,lol. Hopefully it's a planet."],"Longitude":"-80.038148","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.33275,+-80.038148(25826)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25826) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.33275","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/31/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"25826","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25826.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25826.html"],"Summary":"very bright, starts from left to right","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Bethel Park","There was one other sighting in Bethel Park on or around May 31st 2010"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Diamond, Star-like","Log Number":"US-10112010-0021"}
