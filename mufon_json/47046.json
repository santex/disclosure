We were headed out to riveria beach to fuel up. As we passed a \"super yacht\" marina I snapped a picture of the yacht designed and owned by Steve Jobs. Today 3 days later I downloaded picture to my computer and noticed something in the sky, zoomed in and it is not a plane, helicopter, or the goodyear blimp (wich we see all the time in south Florida). Pretty interesting. Cant figure this one out. I am not a stranger to sightings and have contacted MUFON on a few occasions. Last sighting was the end of 2012 around christmas time in Rhode Island when a HUGE saucer shaped object passed VERY VERY low right over me and friends. I believe the MUFON investigator I spoke to was BOB. Because of my job I did not let anyone else know about this."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47046.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/47046_submitter_file1__stevejobs.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47046.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"47046","Source":"MUFON","City":"Lake Park","Latitude":"26.80584","Date of the Event":"04/26/2013 08:38 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-04282013-0017","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.80584,+-80.06366(47046)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47046) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Lake Park","There were no other sightings in Lake Park on or around April 26th 2013","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Summary":"I was out on a private yacht from palm beach heading north taking pictures"}
