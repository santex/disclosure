{"divs":["Sighting Details1. Just hanging out in the front yard. 2. Bright meandering lights in the sky. 3. Joked with my friend about UFO's. 4. Looked up from the driveway in South East Las Vegas, NV to see three streaks of flames weaving and meandering. They appeared to be losing altitude. Grabbed binoculars and could see what appeared to be sparks and debris coming from the tails of the flames. As the objects which were to far away to make out continued to fall, two of them appear to burn out, and then reignited. Judging from the perceived altitude and distance, perhaps over Hoover Dam. 5. After viewing with the binoculars we thought a large airplane had broken up and crashed. 6. Object Fell below treeline."],"Case Number":"50673","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Nevada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.984062,+-114.826332(50673)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50673) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09082013-0002","Latitude":"35.984062","Summary":"look like 3 separate fireballs with trails of sparks falling from high altitude in a meandering path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50673.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50673.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/07/2013 12:00 UTC","City":"Boulder City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"09/08/2013 01:22 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Boulder City","There were no other sightings in Boulder City on or around September 7th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Longitude":"-114.826332"}
