At first I thought it was a plane and when I did not hear any noise as it went over head, I thought it was a satellite but it moved way to fast. It stayed in a straight path moving from the SW to the NE. I was not sure at first what I saw but it was not a satellite, airplane or meteor. I was excited and called my son out to see it but he did not make it time. My wife did see this object. The object finally flew behind the trees. This all took place in less than 30 seconds."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Muskegon Township","There were no other sightings in Muskegon Township on or around June 8th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"39061","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.294777,+-86.172994(39061)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39061) map </A>","Summary":"Bright White light.
