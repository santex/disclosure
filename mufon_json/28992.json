{"Tags":"City","trends":[],"divs":["sighting detailsi am a videographer and just got done filming a wedding. i let my dog outside and since it was a really nice night...i figured i would watch the skies for a few minutes...hoping to see this same ufo i have seen on several occasions...just felt the urge to go out there...so i went out there with her. out of nowhere...right in the clear sky...close enough again to me...to actually startle someone...a very, very bright white orb flew right by me...very low...if conventional...it was easily close enough to hear something, but as always...it was completely silent...not even wind resistance...and not a satellite because towards the south there was a line of clouds and it was clearly below cloud level...as it started to make a sweeping turn. it was moving southwest...right towards o'hare airport...so i am sure if modern radar picks these things up when i see them...they are aware that something was in the sky every single time i reported (see illinois database), i have never seen the object go in that exact direction...and it was without question...(no radar gun on it, but it appeared to be moving faster than i have ever seen before...but not as fast as a shooting star. the orb suddenly started a long sweeping turn...and as it made that sweeping turn...it began flashing like a strobe light. whether private experimental...military experimental...i will give you that possibility...as long as you give me it is possible this craft was not of this earth...but whatever it was...was under intelligent control. it was not moving in a straight line...it was not way above the clouds...it was not a plane...and it was as bright as the sun. i ran inside to grab my cameras, but could not get a good shot of it...but at least i saw it...and i have promised everyone that i will get seriously close up footage this summer. i am mad i did not have my camcorders out there...but i am also encouraged that once again...it came back like i predicted it would and it came seriously close to me again...this summer...at one point...i will be ready and get this thing on film again. search you tube for ufo in hd if you wanted to see video of the object 2 miles away...but zoomed in. it will be on page 7 of your you tube search. satellites do not hover...they do not travel at low altitudes...they do not make turns...they do not shoot up into the stars...they do not shoot beams down at you...after careful consideration after all these experiences...i lean towards exotic experimental aircraft (military or private) and or it is not of this earth. not a ball of lightning, not a meteor, not the iss, not accelerated imagination, hallucinogenic drugs or alcohol, either. once you see it...anyone reading this will agree that it is not like anything you have ever seen in the sky in your entire life. it is so low and so bright...but you have to be looking in that direction and get lucky...but if you just look up every now and then...you will eventually see what i am seeing and it is worth the wait...trust me on this...your heart will pump like crazy...it is a very exciting feeling to see it. it is around...this sighting was late, but i have watched indiana, illinois, michigan, ohio and wisconsin on mufon and without question...people have seen this same exact object in the midwest. this thing is an awesome sight and right away...it is easy to see it is not a plane or helicopter or satellite or ball of lightning...it will eventually show you that it is not one of those things and that is the best part...it seems to do something different each time. last night...reconfirmed my gut feelings i have said months ago...that #1...i will see this object again...#2...it will come close to me again...and #3...i will get close up footage. well...#3 will come later this summer and i am disappointed i did not have the cameras out with me...but when you see one for the first time...trust me on this...seeing is believing for you...so because it is so rare...just be happy to have seen it...each sighting usually last only a few seconds. even if i had my camera...it would take a couple seconds to get it out of my camera bag...and turn it on. so this summer...i am taking 3 camcorders out with me...all on tripods...recording as i sit out there...because when i go out there...they show up and it freaks me out too, trust me. i have never ever seen one ufo in my entire life for 40 years. i would read stories and just be dying to see just one for a few seconds. i wrote a screenplay all about dulce, new mexico and when that script was complete is exactly when i saw my first one. i am disappointed i did not get good proof this time, but at least i got to see it again and i am seriously encouraged that this summer i will get the close up footage that i promised. i swear i wish stanton friedman and james fox could just sit with me...because i can show it to them, but i cannot promise to deliver it to you on one specific night...everyone has to patient. that is the problem. last night...i did not even have to wait long at all, but i have waited for a while to see it some nights. i know that sounds nuts, but once you see it...you will want to see it again...hoping just one more time...for a few seconds. it is always the most awesome sight imaginable...better than the thrill of a meteor or comet because it is not just a flash...it is a bit slower. that mercury ball foo - fighter theory in wwii...from those descriptions...this is exactly what i have seen and experienced. i am in park ridge. i have said this many times...the way to see a ufo is to seriously go outside on a nice summer night and you have to patiently watch the skies. you will see it for sure if you sit out from 8:30 pm to 11:30 pm in the chicago area. many of my reports had multiple sightings and the same exact descriptions...same exact times...same exact directions. if you put in just a little bit of time and star gaze...you will see your first ufo. every single time you are outside this summer...take a look. it happens so fast...you will see how hard it is...to get it filmed...and that is frustrating...but you will just be happy to see it for a few seconds...it is amazing and it is so different from anything i have ever seen in my life. i feel like it is not of this earth, but i cannot prove who is driving this thing. i also have the feeling that on several occasions whatever was up there wanted me to see it. i never saw it start flashing before last night...that was a first. the last few times i saw it...ended the argument that what i was seeing was a satellite reflecting light towards the earth. that is not what i have seen. it is so low and so bright...it is unmistakable. i hope one person sees this...follows my advice and you get to see this awesome white orb...it is big...it is clear as day...it is silent...it may stop...lower altitudes and hover right over you...it even put a beam down upon my face once. it got so close that time...that i ran back inside. when it was that close (above 100 feet above the power lines), you could see structure and black framing and more details...like some type of cockpit...around what looks exactly like an electromagnetic glow...black curved framing around a ball of lightning. but before you cast me aside...balls of lighting do not turn, hover, flash, shine a beam of light down and\\or shoot into the stars like the fastest rocket ever created. someone is in this structured silent craft, but who is it? is it human or not human is what you will say out loud or think when you see it...and if you put in just a little effort...in this area of the country...you will see it i can promise you that...you will see it and agree with every single word of this rambling novel. this summer...close up footage to come and i am more sure of that now because it was back last night. i was thinking i might never see it again, but i just had a gut feeling i will continue to see it...it will continue to get close and this summer by god...i will get the footage to prove it. it happens so quick it is hard to catch it...you will eventually see what i mean. you have no time to run in and get the camera started...etc. so...this summer...i am just going to record in 3 different directions towards the sky...and let them run for hours. if i am out there...this thing seems to show up over and over and over again...but no one really cares, no one really listens and no one really puts in any effort to investigate or put the effort into seeing it for themselves. at times...like last night...it is frustrating, but other times...i am feeling like...why should i bother to prove it and force people to believe me? well...i am a nice guy and i wanted to share the experience. i have photos too and multiple witnesses from my neighborhood and multiple reports to mufon where i went above and beyond to describe in full detail and provided video and photos to them...and nothing has been done. if someone spent some time with me...they would be able to see it. if people are serious about the study of ufo's...all you have to do is look up into the skies...in the midwest...if you spend the time to just look up at night...you will see it for sure and see that every word i said on this rant is 100% true. i am not sure a skeptic would be able to explain this away...but they have to put the effort into seeing it instead of just discounting my report without seeing the same exact ufo in person themselves. put in the effort. see it. experience it. then and only then can you pass judgements. photographic and video evidence...even in hd...is hard to match your own eyesight. the only way a skeptic can prove me wrong is if they have the same exact sighting of the same object at the same time. they would have to agree that whatever it is...it is under intelligent control and that is absolutely clearly displayed. when you see it...you will see what i mean...it gives off an other-worldly feeling and in some ways...because it is silent...it is so spooky too. you will see what i mean when you see it...those of you that put in the effort will see it."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/06/2011 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.634935","Longitude":"-89.393088","Summary":"Low-Flying Silent Bright Orb
