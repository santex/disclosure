(=lunar diameter) and 60 minutes. diameter seemed about 1\\10 to 1\\12 of length. there were no visible head, tail, fins, wings, etc.; however i had a visual impression of ridges or nodes between each pair of lights. typing colons separated by capital letter \"i's\" gives the idea, :i:i:i:i:i:i:i:i: but the nodes had less \"tittle\" (head & tail of the vertical \"i\") and were symmetrically placed, unlike this typing which shows the \"i\" taller than the colons. while it's possible the nodes were a visual artifact, i'd vote 60\\40 for objective vision. its ~45 degree straight-line motion was close to due northward, roughly on a line (depending on altitude) from mt. hood to mt. adams, and carried it partway toward the nw horizon into an area of hazier night sky. i lost sight of it then, after 5 seconds observation, and i'm unable to say whether it faded out in the haze or suddenly disappeared --- a tree blocked view momentarily. i'm accustomed to aerial observation, have 20\\20 vision, do not use any type of intoxicant, was instantly awake and alert for this observation, and have a long track record of rapid, accurate identification of flying birds, aircraft, etc. i'm fairly confidant in my rough estimates of object and motion arc-length, relative length & breadth of object, duration of observation, and sky location of object. estimate of altitude (2-10 miles) is much more of a guess and is the main variable in trigonometrically estimating length of object, velocity of motion, etc. the most conservative estimates yield an object length of 130' and velocity of 600 mph; the high end estimates give figures 10x greater. but without someone else's observation from a different location (allowing triangulation, and correction of observer subjectivity), this is all rough guesswork. i've wondered if this could've been a jetliner with two rows of lighted fuselage windows visible; but such an aircraft would have to fly upside down, or more exactly, with myself directly dorsal to the plane, to make both rows of window lights visible. most unlikely, and a conventional jet\\rocket\\propeller driven aircraft of that arclength would've made plenty of noise; and this object was utterly silent. its wings would've blocked out starfields (whereas i only observed the pipe-shaped \"fuselage\" blocking out stars), & of course there were no navigation\\running lights. i wrote down my observations in the minutes after sighting. as this is the second ufo sighting in my life (3\\1981 was the previous one), i was not worked up or excited by this event, but it sure grabbed my attention, and i reviewed my visual memories many times. later in the night,i did have a brief but strange dream. the rough trigonometry came a couple of days later."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Windy","Case Number":"7776","Date Submitted":"08/03/2007 02:00 UTC","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7776.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7776.html"]}
