I was on the 91 freeway eastbound . The sun had gone down at least thirty minutes earlier. I was nearing my exit at Valley View , when something caught my attention in the sky directly infront of me at about 45 degrees . I noticed a reddish, orangish ball about the size if a dime, appeared very quickly then dissapeared . It caught my attention and I began to look for any aircraft lights then again it reappeared for maybe a second or two, then the best way to desribe it , like the old fashion cameras from the fortys with the flash bulb.
