He took 2 pictures that night. This one, is the first and the second one, you see the sunset he took 3 seconds later. It was not until later that there was something in the picture that seemed to look like what is classified as a UFO. I have always seen UFOs on TV in specials and whatnot, but this, was creepy. He didn't get to see where it was going or what it actually looked like cause it was going so fast and he was driving. I had him send it to me though my phone and then sent it to my computer via email and I sharpened it it see the details. All I can say is that I never realized that they were this close to us."],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Summary":"Crain Hill Road UFO","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Traverse City","There were no other sightings in Traverse City on or around April 8th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Traverse City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-85.613332","Log Number":"US-04272011-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.767357,+-85.613332(28834)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28834) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"28834","Date of the Event":"04/08/2011 06:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28834.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28834_submitter_file1__downsized_0503002048.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28834_submitter_file2__0503002048a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28834.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"44.767357","Object Features":"Unknown"}
