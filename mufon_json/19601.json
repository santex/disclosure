I sat there stunned and while trying to convince myself it was a plane it dropped down real quick (something a plane cannot do) It kept going along its path and then dissapeared, not behind trees or buildings but just plain dissapeared. This was a ufo, no doubt in my mind. I tried convincing myself differently but, it was not possible."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
