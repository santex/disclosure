The object appeared straight at first looking like a straight line then it changed shapes turning into a circle, then what looked like the letter M, then an S shape, then looping around itself almost as if were going to tie itself in a knot. It was in the sky for over 15 mins and wasnt affected by the wind it stood stationary while it changed shapes. as i walked closer to the water to observe it i noticed it looked almost like a liquid, it was jet back and as i got to the water and looked up at it again it vanished into thin air as i was looking at it."],"Case Number":"38721","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.959592","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON"}
