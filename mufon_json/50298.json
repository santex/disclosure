Noticed \"stars\" moving slowly. One larger, and then 2-6 smaller lights following, seeming to appear and disappear. They would stop and start again. 2 lights changed direction from E. to W. to N. to S. and moved toward each other and crossed paths. I considered airplanes at first, but then noticed the stopping and starting, and direction changes. I thought that this was not an airplane or a satellite because of the motions. I was excited to see it. Went inside to have my husband observe also. The objects just seemed to disappear, but it was partly cloudy."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.906439,+-84.296616(50298)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50298) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50298.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50298.html"],"City":"Fort Jennings","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08302013-0013","Country":"United States","Case Number":"50298"}
