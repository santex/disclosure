I was onI-77 northbound and was just passing the copley rd. exit. I saw lights thatapperaed to be floating in the sky. I couldnt tell the shape but it looked likeit could be a plane or helicopter. As I looked at it I realized it was notmoving. I thought that maybe it was just the lights on top of a cellular toweror something. I couldnt see anything under them however. As I continued down thehighway about 30 seconds later, I saw what appeared to be another group oflights either crossing the highway, or just to the left side of it headingtowards the other group of lights. I thought it was a plane at first but Itseemed to be moving too slow, then I thought it was a helicopter. I rolled downmy window and didnt hear a sound. As it passed over the trees to my left, Icould see the lights were in a triangular shape. There was a white light at thetip and two white lights behind that. The back two were red.W"],"Summary":"saw 1-2 triangular formations of light in the sky","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
