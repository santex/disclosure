Visibility was unlimited with scattered clouds coming in from the west. I was westbound on St Joseph blvd leaving Orleans. Coming over the hill heading toward Bearbrook rd, I noticed a single bright stationary light (too bright for aircraft landing lights) below a small cloud in the western sky. After about 15 seconds it suddenly increased altitude at a fixed speed at a 70deg northerly angle and in about 2 seconds disappeared in the small cloud. It did not reappear above the cloud. When I got home I checked a weather website to verify the cloud ceiling (2850m). I then roughly sketched what I saw and used digital calipers to estimate the altitude of the ball of light (approx 2600m). Based on the altitude and distance the ball of light traveled (approx 300m), I estimated the speed of climb at around 500kph (300mph). On June 16 I did a web search for UFO sightings for the 15th and there were a number of sightings reported for that day."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"Canada","Date Submitted":"06/16/2013 10:31 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"48172","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48172.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48172.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.42556","City":"Ottawa","Summary":"Hovering ball of light suddenly climbs and disappears in a cloud","Date of the Event":"06/15/2013 08:50 UTC","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Ottawa","There was one other sighting in Ottawa on or around June 15th 2013"],"Log Number":"CA-06162013-0015","Longitude":"-75.688193","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15"}
