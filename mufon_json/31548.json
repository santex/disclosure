I entered the toilet, we have this small porthole window where I then noticed a rather unusual orb descend at quite an astonishing speed. It left a trail and made no noise then instantly vanished. I don't drink alcohol or any other forms of narcotics, and I wasn't too tired, it was all too real. I was a little astounded after witnessing it, I am a firm believer of extraterrestrial life, but I never thought I'd witness something as such. As mentioned in the form, we have quite a few airplanes fly around here, but I'd like to think that a plane can't descend in an aura of white light and vanish without making a sound."],"trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Melbourne","There were no other sightings in Melbourne on or around September 4th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
