{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWas at a friend's house doing fireworks. They live in the middle of the city and around 9 or 9:15 my husband comes up to me and says \"look over there in the sky\" I looked up to the northwest and there they were. Two of them. They looked like balls of orange and they were both going the same direction. At first we thought they were airplanes, but then we could not see any other lights (blue or red blinking). Then a few minutes they just vanished. My one friend said they were airplanes. Well then after we had done all of the fireworks and we were just letting the kids do sparklers another Ball of Orange showed up. This was around 9:45. And it was by itself. I got a picture with my friends camera, but her camera is not really good. It traveled the same way as the first two orange balls. Traveling due West to northwest. At first everyone was like \"it has to be a hot air balloon\" but I told everyone it was an UFO."],"Log Number":"US-07102009-0011","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Case Number":"18001","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Evansville","Summary":"Looked like a orange ball in the air above tree line.","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18001.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18001.html"],"Region":"Indiana","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-87.56282","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.979229,+-87.56282(18001)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18001) map </A>","Latitude":"37.979229","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 09:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Evansville","There were no other sightings in Evansville on or around July 4th 2009"]}
