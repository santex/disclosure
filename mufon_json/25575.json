It began making irregular turns that a meteorite or jet would not make (S-turns followed by long straights, with abrupt reversals.) At this point, the head of the trail wasn't visible. As it drew closer to me, it was obvious that whatever it was was a.)very high up, as no sound could be heard, and b.)moving very quickly. At it's closest point to myself, I observed 4 lights, 3 amber in an equilateral pattern, and a fourth red, blinking light in it's center. I could only see the lights. The middle blinked at about once per second. It then continued on a sweeping turn south, before being lost to sight when all lights abruptly turned off."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-97.31239","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around September 26th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Case Number":"25575","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Fort Worth","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25575.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25575.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Triangle with Contrail"}
