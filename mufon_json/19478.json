There names are listed on this report and they are happy to receive a call to discuss this siting further. My parents were at their vacation home in Berkeley Springs, WV. They were looking in the sky for comets and planets, like they usually do. The sky was very clear last night. They saw an object in the sky. It was a large, bright, white, circular light. The object seemed to hover. They watched it for a few seconds and the object began to emit a misty cone shape light beneath it. This lasted a few more seconds. They report the light disappeared into the object and object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very fast speed and disappeared. They heard no sound during this event."],"Tags":"City"}
