I noticed what looked like a large satellite flying from SW to NE at a very moderate, absolutely silent speed about four to six hundred yards in the black sky. It was 100 times brighter than any star in the sky that was coming out at that time. I watched this unknown object fly and veer towards the NE direction, as a second one catches my eye about one minute behind it, traveling identically as the first one. As the first one got in the distance a little ways exactly in the NE direction, it just vanished, I then mentioned that if the second one does the same thing, I thought that would be strange. So I focused on this second object, like deja vu flying in the same quiet constant path approach the same exact spot as the first one and just vanish. My friend nor I can explain what we saw.
