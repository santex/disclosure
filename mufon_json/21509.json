I later went out side with my video camera and captured the fire in the sky comming down and at first thought they were metorites, but after the objects went back up I changed my mind.I had the tape put on local news. I went back out the next night,and nights after that to keep picking up strange crafts on tape. The saga has been going on from June 15, 2009 untill the preasent day. the tapes speak for their sleves. I have sent them by Ronald. please write me and tell me what you think of tnis.
