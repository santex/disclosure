Five objects with the same 4 red pulsating lights and one bright white blinking light circled the base for about 10-12 mins. The flight paths these craft were flying did not match any usual pattern i regularly see, its like they were surrounding the base. They circled around 3 times then one of them made an abrupt left turn, stopped, then headed back towards my direction. Suddenly it emitted this super bright light for 2 seconds that looked like it was burning because it flickered eratically. After that, all of the objects split off in different directions slowly fading out and all of them disappeared at different altitudes. The one object that emitted the bright light was last to disappear heading south towards L.A. disappearing below the horizon. Shortly after i start hearing jets with their after burners on.. This has been my 3rd sighting in oxnard so far and hope to see more."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-119.221034","Date of the Event":"11/22/2011 09:28 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
