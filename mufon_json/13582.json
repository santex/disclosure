{"divs":["sighting detailsi was driving with my brother in law to pick up dinner on a suburban road. the street has some houses but is primarily woods on either side of road. we were going pretty slow about 30-35 mph. it was a clear fall day before dusk so it was still pretty light out. off the front right of the car at the edge of the woods \\ street line was a bright shiny whiteish silverish ball or sphere hovering about 12 feet off the ground like it was waiting for us to come around the corner. it was about 40 feet from the car and it was the size of a large beach ball maybe 3ft. in diameter. without asking him i knew my brother in law saw it b\\c he slowed down a little to about 20 mph. it hovered until we got even with it then it matched our speed and travelled next to us a little closer at about 30ft. off to the side for a few seconds, we were going really slow at this point maybe 10 mph b\\c we were both in shock or amazed, like mezmerized. all of a sudden it shot off really fast up and away to the right kind of diagonally. we were very close and got a good look at it, nothing i can imagine of that is manmade is capable of this kind of movement. we both sat there for a second and then said - did you see what i just saw? we described to each other what we saw and it was the exact same. the whole experience lasted about 15 seconds. it felt like this ball was kind of just checking us out. it was not an optical illusion or anything i am sure of that. never had an experience like that before or since. this was in 2005 i am writing it now to get it off my chest."],"Date Submitted":"10/01/2005 06:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-11072008-0007","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Hingham","There were no other sightings in Hingham on or around October 1st 2005"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.241767","Summary":"Silvery / white bright sphere hovering then moving slowly then shoots off","Longitude":"-70.889768","Case Number":"13582","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13582.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13582.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"10/01/2005 06:00 UTC","Region":"Massachusetts","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.241767,+-70.889768(13582)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13582) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Hingham","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Country":"United States"}
