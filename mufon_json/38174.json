When I went to look for a very bright star to the west. When I looked into the sky I saw these two pulsating orange color orbs came from the south west heading north east no sound traveling quite fast. pass behind trees and only one came out and then that one just fizzled out... I couldnt take my eyes off of them. I have never seen anything like this. It was not an air plane or a helicopter it didnt make a sound. The two objects stayed the same length apart. It was the weirdest thing I ever saw."],"Date Submitted":"05/15/2012 10:26 UTC","Log Number":"US-05152012-0022","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"38174","Summary":"two pulsating orange color orbs came from the south west heading north east no sound traveling","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/12/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.208222,+-77.189875(38174)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38174) map </A>","trends":[],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38174.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38174.html"]}
