After arriving at my house a short distance further, we looked up at the sky and noticed a black triangular object floating high just east of golden. At first we thought it may be some giant kite with very high altitude, but after looking through binoculars the object was unwavering. It stayed in one single spot for over a half hour. The sun started to go down and we kept the object in view of the binoculars. Using a small star as a reference point, the object began to rise a fall extremely fast around the star. It climbed once again and was stationary until the sun went down. It almost looked like a hovering, stationary, black, stealth fighter. It was large, but even in the binoculars it had not definite details on its outer shell. Very strange, but a very interesting first encounter."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"6034","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-105.21554","City":"Golden","Summary":"Black Triangular Object Over Golden","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6034.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6034.html"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.764193,+-105.21554(6034)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6034) map </A>"}
