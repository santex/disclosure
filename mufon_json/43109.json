My two older kids were outside in front of the house waiting foe their friends to arrive. My two kids came running in yelling I think there is a UFO outside. I ran outside thinking in my head no way. I turned a face the object but while I was looking at it i could see different color lights moving across from each other. The object kept going further and further away until I could barely see it again, so I thought to myself this is no UFO. When I turned around to walk in my house the object went from being so far away to about 2 houses from my house no sound. I looked at it and it was this big huge circular object my kids and I were so afraid we started running towards my house. I got the chills all through my body.We made it inside the house we were all afraid. We gave it a few minutes and then we went to the back yard to see if it was still out there but it was not. My kids friend finally made it to my house. When they got to my house they were yelling and saying that they had seen a UFO and they were scare. My kids and I told them that we had seen the samething. Ever since I have seen this I have some weird and strange things happen to me. Its to the point that I'am afraid to go to sleep. If there is someone out there reading this please call me. if you know something that can help me I would really appreciate it.
