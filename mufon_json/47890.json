{"Latitude":"40.345575","Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Solid illuminated object that passed across the sky in a straight line and steady speed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06052013-0012","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out during the late evening talking with two of my neighbors, while we outside we noticed a few aircraft flying over at what appeared to be at various altitudes and they had typical aircraft lights such as strobes and wing lights. We later noticed a solid, round, lit up object moving at a steady speed which seemed to be at normal cruising speed of a commercial jet except at a much lower altitude. The intensity of the light remained constant as it passed overhead in a straight line from west to east. At first I thought it may have been a satellite, but the altitude and the nature of the bright light, led me to think otherwise. The object remained in view for no more than 5 minutes, then was obscured from view by trees and houses to the east."],"Date of the Event":"06/04/2013 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-76.40155","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.345575,+-76.40155(47890)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47890) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"47890","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47890.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47890.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Lebanon","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"06/05/2013 04:14 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Lebanon","There were no other sightings in Lebanon on or around June 4th 2013"]}
