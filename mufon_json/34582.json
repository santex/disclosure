It would pulsate a bright golden color then dissapear and appear in the same spot. It also went from a bright light to a small dot then back again. I was watching it the whole time and in the middle of doing this it appeared to go very bright and 2 or 3 small lights appeared beneath almost as if they dropped from it. The pictures a high def so you can zoom in. Also i have noticed that every time i step outside late at night over the post few months there are a couple of light flashes noticeable to the eye, do you know anything about this? I have more pictures of the orb also."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34582.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34582_submitter_file1__ufo5.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34582_submitter_file2__ufo2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34582_submitter_file3__ufo1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34582.html"],"Region":"Victoria","Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"-37.869949","Country":"Australia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-37.869949,+145.237095(34582)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34582) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Wantirna South","Longitude":"145.237095","Summary":"UFO orb sighting 3/1/2012.
