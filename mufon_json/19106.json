{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my friend were walking for our late night run. We walk to the middle school track for our run. We notice this bright golden color light, we thought start at first but then it came clear it was to close and bright. the walk from down the street to the track was about 5 minutes because we walk slow, and were also stopping occasionally to observe the object. There was this sphere like object that had a glow in the middle with a ring of light surrounding it. As the 5 minutes passed we notice the object move closer. My heart was racing and I made a run for it with my friend a little ahead of me. We seen the object fly over head some distance to the right I saw 4 lights on the bottom all evenly spaced apart making a plus sign. The object then disappeared into the horizon. However what makes me doubt it was anything special was the fact that i heard an engine sound to it. That still doesn't explain how it stood still in air for 5 minutes."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/06/2009 06:24 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.791764,+-86.10055(19106)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19106) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19106.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19106.html"],"Latitude":"42.791764","Region":"Michigan","Date of the Event":"08/04/2009 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-09062009-0011","City":"Holland","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Holland","There were no other sightings in Holland on or around August 4th 2009"],"Case Number":"19106","Object Shape":"Blimp, Egg, Saturn-like, Sphere, Star-like","Longitude":"-86.10055","Summary":"bright light in the sky stood in place for like 5 mins before flying overhead"}
