The sky was crystal clear so I began observing Orion @ about 85degrees up in the central western region. Suddenly a bright star appeared inOrion and traveled North at a speed that covered half the distance to thehorizon in about 25 seconds. I thought it may have been a low orbit satellitebut suddenly another star appeared in Orion on the same course as the first andappeared to be chasing the original star. By now the first star was two thirdsof the way to the horizon when the second star caught up to it in about 5seconds. It came very close and then veered Northwest and was gone 3 secondslater. 5 seconds later the original star vanished. As a commercial helicopterpilot my guess at the altitude of these two objects was well over 50,000 feet.The stars never blinked and neither did I."]}
