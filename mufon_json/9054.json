It was so bright that it appeared close. I figured that I may overtake it before I had driven 30 miles. This never happened. So my next thought was that it was Venus. Upon arriving at my destination, I pulled up the Sky and Telescope website and the interactive sky chart. I plugged in the time of sighting and rotated to the location. Sure enough it was Venus. The relationship of the Sun, Venus and the Earth made for a beautiful observation. In fact you could still see it after the Sun rose. I was disappointed that it wasnt an UFO, I sighted one in 1989, but thrilled at the picturesque scene our solar system has to offer."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/19/2008 06:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Frisco","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9054.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9054.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.150674,+-96.823612(9054)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9054) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Venus Bright in the southeast sky","Date of the Event":"01/19/2008 06:00 UTC","Longitude":"-96.823612","Log Number":"US-01192008-0023","Object Features":"Other"}
