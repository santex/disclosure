There was a row of bright large rectangular windows with about a 2:1 hight to width ratio. At this time I was finishing my studies in Aircraft Design, so I tried to think of what it was that I saw. The only thing that came into mind was the gondola of a blimp. I don't recall why we couldn't see the shape, but I couldn't and was most fixed on the windows. We lowered the windows to see if we could hear the engines, but it was dead silent. We also could not determine as how far it was from us, so I drove the car across the highway to the left side of the Prentice Hall building while sticking our heads out and looking up to see if it would pass over us. It had been moving to the north an a crawling speed. We didn't see it pass over us and when we got into the Prentice Hall parking lot we got out of the car and looked in every direction and there was no sight of it. When I went to school, I asked a professor if blimps fly at night, and he said: No! When I got home, I called Langley fields in NJ where the blimps are, and they also told me the same thing. I've always wondered what we Saw that night and when I came across this web site I started checking it out and found several similar reports in this area over the last 30+ years and one only a few blocks away on the same highway, and one a few miles away near the GW bridge."],"Object Features":"Window(s)"}
