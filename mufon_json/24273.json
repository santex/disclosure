Traveled over us, straight, same level. Second followed when first out of sight.","divs":["sighting detailsi dont know if i can put thisin writing. we were close to being back home from watching fireworks at the mall of ga. driving down hwy. 124, approaching the publix, my husband (driving) asked what something was off to the right, pointing just past hwy. 332 above some warehouses. it seemed stationary so i said it looked like one of the bigger balloons that i had seen attached to ropes when driving down the freeway as sort of an advertisement or eye-catcher. they are larger balloons tied to a really long rope but attached to a building. then it started moving toward us. we stopped at the 4 way stop and hesitated there watching it start to move north parallel with hwy. 332. we were going to turn left onto 332 and did but pulled into the cvs parking lot and drove behind the building still watching the movement. it seemed to start off slowly because we had time to stop at the stop sign, turn and turn into the cvs and park. the 3 of us bailed out, including my 12 year old son, still watching as it had not gotten to us but was still moving toward that direction. my son and i got our cell phones out and video taped it, moving toward us, over us at a stead pace and level and finally started to disappear over the treetops. about the time i closed my phone, my husband says, here comes another. i turned immediately and started to video tape the second as i told my son of the second one, he finished taping the first and turned to the second. when i turned to the second one, it was just about the same place that we had first seen the original one. the second one also moved at a steady and level rate following in what we believed to be the same exact path as the first. if i had to guess, i would say maybe 35-40 mph. as the second one moved over us, i steadily held my phone up and moved it at a slow rate above me. i could not see well as i watched the phone so i would glance away from my phone (still recording) and look at the object directly. both objects were the same size. possibly the size of a hippty-hop bouncy toy or the size of an extra large kick ball. these did not have anything extending from the side like a meteor or from the bottom like with a hot air balloon. there was no extension like a basket or of the balloon or anything like that. only round. to me it still seemed like this round red balloon but it had fire under it (or on the bottom) or it was just a round flame. a small fireball traveling across the sky. in discussing later, my son and husband thought it only looked like a fireball though. they did not get the impression of the balloon with the fire at the base like i did. the fire did not blow then stop blowing the like a hot air balloon would have fire blowing up from the bottom. the flame was very steady and, neither object made a noise. they were silent, absolutely no sound what so ever. they seemed to travel fairly close to the ground, very level, not up and down or back and forth. very steady. they seemed to be lower than the small air planes that land at our small town airport. maybe the height of 2 or 3 tall trees up? (not good at measuring distance anyway but my husband probably could give a better idea of that). as the second one was going further away, the fire seemed to die out some, then the flame came back. when first dying out i thought maybe we could see the flame much better from the front and not so well from the back because we were able to see it coming from a good distance away but not leaving us. but when the flame\\brightness came back that once, it made me think that it was just disappearing. i don't know, it was just gone! suddenly. my son has remote control air planes, little ones that you can buy at walmart. i know how these sound, this was no remote control item. i have seen the larger ones flown and you can hear them flying from 1\\2 mile away, at least. it was no weather balloon or fireworks. it was controlled: height from the ground, mph, path, everything. we were all 3 in awe and absolutely amazed. we kept asking, what could it be? could anyone figure it out yet? it was not a flash, it took maybe 10-13 minutes while we stopped at the stop sign, drove a few feet, then stopped in the parking lot and stood out of the car watching both objects. i went to bed that night almost in tears knowing what we had seen. i am 45 and have never in my life had something so amazing that i could not come up some type of explanation. i wonder if there were others that had see them. there had to be! there was about 3 cars in the drive-thru next to where we stood and watched. these people had to have looked up to see what we were looking at and video taping with our phones. i wondered how do you call your police dept and make a report of something. when i mentioned that to my son, he was concerned that they would take him away because we were crazy but he knows what we saw was real. what, we don't know but it was real. someone would have to do a lot to prove to me that was not a ufo. it would have to be proven under the same conditions, air, moon light, time of night, etc. i would love for someone to prove it was something different!! video attachments are noted with date and time in the title. 7\\4\\10_22:32 and 22:34. the second one was started from my right, then straight above me then past me to my left. the first one i could not tell you exactly because we bailed out of the car and started taping so quickly. for the second one, i know more of where i was standing and my actions since i had time to video tape the first one and realize what i might be looking at."]}
