And I looked out my shower window and saw two round sphere like objects coming from the return North. They were moving not a fast speed but more like a steady pace speed heading towards the south. It looked like some kind Of top secret military drone or carft. It had more like a darkish brown color to it. I did not see any kind of exhaust trail behind it nor Did I hear any sound at the time. It was about 5,000 to 12,000 feet in altitude from my perception. Both objects were either flying side by side or behind one and another. There is MacDill AFB near by towards the south. Also not far from me There was video footage of a flying triangle. Also known as the TRB3 code name \"Astra\" this is $1,000,000,000 project highly classified and developed By the U.S. Air force. So I would not be surprised. This is not the first time I've seen something like this"],"Longitude":"-82.456148","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.952635,+-82.456148(14788)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14788) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Summary":"Dark round like objects looking outside my shower window","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14788.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14788.html"],"City":"Tampa","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/05/2009 01:35 UTC","Case Number":"14788"}
