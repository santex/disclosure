Baldy, California, roughly around 11 p.m. and the skies were clear. I noticed a bright bluish light I thought was a star. The more I looked at it I noticed it was bigger than any other stars in the sky. Then I looked to the right of the object and saw the same size object with a redish orange color. Both objects came in towards each other in a straight line, no noise. The sky light up with a huge flash and both objects switched positions and took off at light speed, silently. I am convinced this was not of human origin, impossible at the speed and how fast these objects moved. After the sighting I am absolutely convinced that it was something not of this world. The objects seemed to collide then the sky lit up and they shot off into the distance at an incredibly fast speed until they disappeared."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49873.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.10272","Summary":"Two objects, one blue the other orange red.. came in towards eachother, the sky lit up, they switched positions and took off at an incredibly fast rate.","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"08/20/2006 12:00 UTC","City":"Upland","Case Number":"49873","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.10272,+-117.638858(49873)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49873) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/15/2013 07:48 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.638858","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
