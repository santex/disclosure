There was a burst of about 5 rings of light for about a total of 1.5 to 2 seconds. The last one, that was larger,formed as if it was being drawn with a pencil and did not complete its circle. What I mean is didnt just appear. The colors of the burst were different as in the normal color spectrum of light we see. The lights didnt just blink on and off they appeared to form and faid. I was startled and thinking what was that I just saw. Then about 3 seconds later I noticed what I thought was a medium star. Not really that bright, just what you would think is a normal star about 20 degrees to east of the burst moving at what had to be over 2000 miles per hour, horizontally and past my line of sight in about 4 seconds. I had to tell somebody what I saw because it was not a thing you see every day. But I sure would love to know what it was because it wasnt swamp gas and stars dont move sideways at that speed."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.766083,+-112.446741(23588)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23588) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23588.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23588.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/02/2010 01:21 UTC","City":"Chino Valley","Log Number":"US-06022010-0008","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Arizona"}
