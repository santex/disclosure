i said ���if it was confidential, then say it���s confidential, and i would shut up and hang up. if it���s a really big airplane, then tell me the model, but don���t say you didn���t even know it was there!��� he reviewed radar starting at 6:00 pm. after about a minute he says��� well i see here there was something flying in our airspace, but we weren���t talking to them��� i said ���huh?��� he got quiet, then said ���oh it must be a 747 that landed at about 7:28 pm. he had nothing else to say. i thanked him and hung up. i am not an mit hopeful. i will never be a brain surgeon. i am also not stupid. if it was confidential then why was it flying so slowly and so close to the ground? we all know what the stealth looks like���a weather balloon? a little more tact when insulting someone���s intelligence is in order. yep-it���s unexplained. yep-it looks fishy. what are they doing at our airports? answers would be awesome! i have low expectations."],"Case Number":"32387","Country":"United States"}
