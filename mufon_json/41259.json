It made no sound and varied in brightness from very bright to very dim. It moved in an erratic somewhat circular motion then it seemed to fade away. I ran into the house get my wife and my camera but when we returned outside, no sign of the light could be seen. My wife went back inside but I stayed outside and decided to walk up my street toward where I had seen the light. I got in front of my neighbors house when the light reappeared from the north. It move through the sky to the original spot I had seen it. It remained there, not moving but changing in brightness as it had before. I took 1 picture of it using my old olympus digital camera D-580. The object appeared to rise in the sky , gaining altitude, then disappearing. The object made no sound."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.230452","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around July 29th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Case Number":"41259"}
