It was in January or February of 1979. I do���nt remember the date. We were as scouts on a night mission and was in the countryside (Revinge), east of the city of Lund. We were six members of the scout group. Between two hursts we saw a very big, oval sized object, which contained of a lot of small pulsating lights, soundlessly and slowly moved from the first to the second hurst. It was in the sky but it is hard to estimate the hight of the ufo. Some minutes after the ufo had dissappeared, we saw a police car, in the middle of the night, in the countryside, drive by at high speed. Some days later you could read in the Swedish newspaper that it probabbly was parts of a rocket - hmmm!!!!"],"Longitude":"13.191007","Tags":"City","City":"Lund"}
