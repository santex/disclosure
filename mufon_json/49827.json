When I viewed the photos later, I noticed that to the left of the object there was an image so I magnified it and saw an object. I definitely believe that it is not another star, but some kind of UFO. It was further away then the star and it had a distinct shape. I'm sending two (2) pictures of the object. One is the normal pic the other is the object magnified."],"Tags":"City"}
