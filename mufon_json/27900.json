I could not see it with my bare eyes so I kept shooting. I even video taped it from my I-phone. I would have kept watching but my wife kept annoying me about something else that distracted me. Afterward I decided to view it on the flat screen. As I was doing that I enlarged the photo and scanned thru it. It is an obvious orb that has a glowing light around it. I looked thru the whole screen and can see different light patterns. Some barely visible circular objects with light surrounding the outer borders of it. I am not someone who knows anything about these things or the heavens. So I am sending these pictures to you for your advice. THIS IS NOT A HOAX!!!"],"Summary":"I was taking a picture of the full moon and noticed an orb in my camera.","Case Number":"27900","Date Submitted":"02/19/2011 12:22 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.797269,+-80.224819(27900)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27900) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02192011-0008","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.224819","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","City":"Miami","Date of the Event":"02/18/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Circle, Disc, Fireball, Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27900.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27900.html"],"Latitude":"25.797269","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
