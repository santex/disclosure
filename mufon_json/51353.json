{"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10062013-0025","divs":["sighting detailsmy family and i were returning from newport beach, ca down pacific coast highway 1 and between newport beach, ca and north laguna beach, ca, my mother observed what looked like an oil driller platform (there are three of them about 10 miles or more north towards huntington beach, ca or long beach, ca. and earlier on the way up to newport beach, ca we were looking out towards catalina island and there was a layer of haze or smog and the mountain tops of catalina were only visable), but as my mom told me to look out over the coast and out toward the ocean to the left about 3 degrees to the left from catalina island and directly as high as the island mountains elevation wise, there was a horizontal platform with nothing under it , my eyes adjusted for about 5 seconds then my brother saw it and noted that it was disturbing the ocean water underneath like a helicopter or a hover craft(which i've seen down in oceanside ,ca marine corps\\navy often operate those off the coast) but this was at the same height as the catalina island mountain tops and seemed miles away from me and was bigger than any helicopter or airliner, so 20 seconds after i first saw it from left to right, it disappeared but wasn't instantanious it took a sec and half to disappear(like a windshield wiper), then it was gone for about 15 seconds then reappeared left to right again. at first i thought it was a oil drilling platform thats how far and big it was, then i thought it was a helicopter cause it was hundreds of feet off the ground and was affecting the water below it, like a helicopter(i could see white wash under it, like high winds), then i thought it was a hover craft but it was too far off the ground, and i thought when it disappeared from left to right i thought the helicopter was hovering and rotating and when it disappeared, that was when it was facing me. but after about a minute and 50 seconds all together it disappeared and was never seen again the whole way home. whatever it was, it was big, far away, and wasn't a helicopter or hovercraft, and was bigger than any yacht or sail boat i've ever seen but it was also off the ground and hovering didn't move at all but i was in a moving car so maybe, but i didn't see it move, just disappear, then reappear, then disappear again and it was gone the white wash under it was gone, and my whole family was dumbfounded...3 of my family saw it the driver didn't get to see it but when i described it to him he said thats not a helicopter or boat or hover craft. it looked cigar shaped, really long and narrow like a platform."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51353.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51353.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.544038,+-117.77867(51353)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51353) map </A>","City":"Laguna Beach","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Latitude":"33.544038","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Laguna Beach","There were no other sightings in Laguna Beach on or around October 6th 2013"],"Summary":"cigar shaped object hundreds ft off ground water under was visually effected, next to catalina island","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.77867","Date of the Event":"10/06/2013 05:35 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Case Number":"51353","Date Submitted":"10/06/2013 11:15 UTC"}
