I had seen the same thing on the 4th of July 2012. A firework that never goes out. I felt it was a UFO, 3 orangish orbs in a silent V formation. Very high above in an empty cloudless evening. The sun was setting but they brightly stood out. The first wave came in from the south west, continued north, then slightly veared north west. All three waves followed this path as if following each other.first wave 3 in a V, 3 in a straight line, then 2 that came in like straglers lagging behind. I couldn't believe I was seeing this again. I wasn't scared or worried, more surprised. I Took photos. They all seem to be projecting lights off the bottom, appearing an orangish color, one appears blueish in the photo and upon zooming in appears much like saucer shape with a blue outline around it.I lost site when they continued farther north west."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.972543,+-82.423824(50284)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50284) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Michigan","City":"Port Huron","Date of the Event":"08/24/2013 08:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50284.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50284.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"were leaving for dinner noticed 3 fireball-ish orbs in a V formation. they passed then 3 in a straight row, than 2 straglers behind them.","Log Number":"US-08292013-0030","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.972543","Case Number":"50284","Longitude":"-82.423824"}
