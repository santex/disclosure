Stargazing, we observed a star that seemed to be moving strangly. We are all skeptics and tried our best to come up with an explanation as to what we were seeing. We all agreed, there was none. The object was very far away and appears to have green, red and white lights that would vary in intensities and directions. The object would dart randomly in all directions. The speed of the object and velocity which it quickly changed directions made us conclude that we were witnessing something very interesting. I've never seen a UFO and felt compelled to document my sighting. If anyone saw anything similar, please feel free to contact me. No pictures. My camera wouldn't pick up the lights against the night sky."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/01/2010 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.644074","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Vail","There were no other sightings in Vail on or around June 1st 2010"]}
