There looked to be more than two dozen. They were all the same sized white lights. It was far too high to be birds and they were moving far too quickly. The lights were all traveling in relatively the same direction. From Northeast to Northwest about 50 or 60 degrees up. We pulled over to watch them for about two minutes. They were dashing around in different directions however traveling as a group in one direction. As the large group disappeared behind the cloud completely we saw one more brighter than the rest zip across the entire horizon as if to catch up to the rest of the group."],"Tags":"City"}
