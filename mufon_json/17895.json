I was working as a security supervisor at a major sports uniform manufacturer and I was on interior patrol and part of my patrols is open several exit doors, when I opened one of the doors I saw a star like object that looked like the North Star but it was larger. not thinking anything of it, I blew it off. I looked at the \"star\" again and noticed it was moving from WSW towards the ENE. At arms length, the objects size was about the size of a pea and it was about 2000 feet up, I first thought it was a plane approaching The Indianapolis International Airport, but, the was no flashing lights or sound. it was just a light & I watched it for about 2.5 minutes before it disappeared behind another building."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.524197,+-85.773544(17895)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17895) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
