{"Longitude":"-75.064616","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"3 Glowing Pulsating Red Orbs fly by 3 hours after first sighting!","Case Number":"49958","divs":["Sighting DetailsTook a look out of my kitchen window at approximately 11:30pm, saw 3 of the same lights that I witnessed earlier in the evening. All moving in unison and glowing with a pulsating reddish-orange color. Very flame like. I did not witness this second sighting alone. There was one other person with me who also thought it very strange. We both thought that these were paper lanterns, but not so sure. I am from the Philadelphia metro area and live within the local international airport approach path. These lights were at an altitude that could very easily disrupt incoming planes. I am noticing that there are sightings of this description from both my local NJ area all the way through Ohio and Wisconsin. If anyone has any idea what these lights are please let me know!"],"Date Submitted":"08/18/2013 12:59 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Haddon Heights","There were no other sightings in Haddon Heights on or around August 17th 2013"],"City":"Haddon Heights","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"New Jersey","Latitude":"39.877336","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49958.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49958.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08182013-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.877336,+-75.064616(49958)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49958) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/17/2013 11:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
