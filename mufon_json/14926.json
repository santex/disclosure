At that moment I felt like I should look behind me, as I looked over my shoulder I saw a Large brilliant white light with an orange halo radiating around the outside of the object, it was about 300 feet away traveling at treetop level in a S.W. direction from hwy 19 S. It was in my field of vision for about 5 seconds, before it disappeared on the other side of the trees. It appeared to be bigger than a large helicopter would be at that distance and I've seen helicopters very often in this area, and it certainly wasn't an airplane."],"Latitude":"31.582937","Date of the Event":"01/14/2009 09:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Georgia"}
