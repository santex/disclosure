I looked up and saw a boomerang shaped object less than 1000 feet overhead. It had white lights in a V-shaped pattern on the wings. It moved slowly from east of where I was standing to west. It made no sound at all. At first I thought it was an airplane, then I realized it was way too low and wasn't making any noise. It continued west until I could no longer see it because of the treeline. After I could no longer see it, I realized what I just saw and ran into my house to tell my wife. She was up with our baby grandson, and came out and looked, but did not see anything unusual."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/07/2013 11:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-05082013-0008","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Norman","There were no other sightings in Norman on or around May 7th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"05/08/2013 01:19 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Case Number":"47260","Region":"Oklahoma","City":"Norman","Latitude":"35.202653","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47260.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47260.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-97.397106"}
