{"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04162012-0022","divs":["Sighting DetailsI have lived in Winnie most of my life. I have seen on several occasions unusual lights off Hwy 73. I have always attributed them to planes or helicopters due to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve located in the area. Now I am questioning that since I read the person's account on Feb. 16th this year. My son also called me at work one night because something the size of a 727 flew and hovered very low over our home. There were no lights, and he was 20 years old, and frightened enough to ask me to come home. I thought he had been watching too much TV? He is an Army Reservist, and has since been to Iraq, with less fear than what he says he experienced that night."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cone, Triangle","Date Submitted":"04/16/2012 05:46 UTC","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"03/25/2009 07:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Winnie","There were no other sightings in Winnie on or around March 25th 2009"],"Summary":"Have seen many unusual lights","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"29.82447","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"37522","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37522.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37522.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.82447,+-94.377018(37522)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37522) map </A>","City":"Winnie","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Longitude":"-94.377018","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
