{"Date Submitted":"11/30/1995 09:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was in the fall of 1996 or 97 near the Buffalo airport. I was working at TJ Max near Transit and Main. It was 9-9:30pm and I was on my way home from work. As I was driving I saw an orange ball in the sky at about a 45 degree angle. This object seemed to move toward me as I passed the airpoirt runway. It moved left to right and then came in front of my car. It was shaped like a yellow pencil eraser. It looked as though it had two sections. I pulled over and watched as it turned on its side (now it is almost overhead) and then fire poured from it. It was like liquid fire which turned into ash. I got out of my car and pretended I had a car problem to take a better look but the object disappeared and the ash was still falling."],"Latitude":"42.896347","Summary":"Saw orange ball in sky near Buffalo Niagara International Airport around 9pm.
