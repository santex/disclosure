August 11th I left my house walking to 7-11. I was heading north down the street when I heard a car door shut behind me. When I turned around I saw two cars parked engines running and the lights on. As I watched them drive off I saw a Huge cloud to the south west flash twice and then a huge white orb shot out from over the top of the cloud. It arched over the sky from west to east and then turned south east and disappeared. It was a huge bright white orb. I didnt see any trail of light and it wasnt fuzzy at all. It just floated realy fast through the sky. At first I said to myself what the hell was that. And then I said I just saw a ufo. I cant explain what I saw. It made the hair stand up on my arms. I will never forget what I saw. I have watched the sky all of my life and watch shows about ufo's but never saw anything like this."],"Date Submitted":"09/16/2012 06:12 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"42602","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Bradenton","There were no other sightings in Bradenton on or around August 11th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"I saw a huge thunder cloud flash twice and then a white orb flew from over the top of the cloud in an arch then curve to the south east where it disappeared.","Longitude":"-82.488148","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.430044,+-82.488148(42602)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42602) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"27.430044","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-09162012-0016"}
