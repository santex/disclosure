{"divs":["sighting detailsi have very high bedroom windows. while on the phone, i looked up at the patch of sky that is visible above my neighbor's two story house. out from behind their roof suddenly drifted something with three large, red, steady lights with a white strobe flashing. the apparent size would be length of your thumb held at arm's length. the separation and size of the red lights was like if you positioned three pennies in a triangular pattern with maybe a half-dollar in between them. they were a steady red, not real bright. there was a fairly powerful white strobe located inboard of the three red lights but much closer to the top light in the triangle. the strobe was flashing for approximately 1\\30 of a second in approximately one second intervals. if it was a helicopter, using a typical helicopter as a yardstick, it would have been no more than 100 ft. from me and drifting at no more than 100 ft altitude. there was absolutely no sound. at that hypothetical distance the three red lights would have been more than 18\" in diameter. again, at the hypothetical distance of 100 ft the craft would have been going 25 mph or less, which seems like it would be below the stall speed of any fixed-wing craft. although it seemed like a helicopter going by that close would have made a lot of noise, i went ahead and checked the federal aviation administration (faa) website to see what the regulations are for collision avoidance lights for helicopters. here is an excerpt from the faa regulations for rotorcraft (helicopters) \"(c) flashing characteristics. the arrangement of the system, that is, the number of light sources, beam width, speed of rotation, and other characteristics, must give an effective flash frequency of not less than 40, nor more than 100, cycles per minute. the effective flash frequency is the frequency at which the rotorcraft's complete anticollision light system is observed from a distance, and applies to each sector of light including any overlaps that exist when the system consists of more than one light source. in overlaps, flash frequencies may exceed 100, but not 180, cycles per minute. (d) color. each anticollision light must be aviation red and must meet the applicable requirements of ���27.1397.\" so the lights have to be red but they must be flashing lights. the lights outside my bedroom window were not flashing at all but a steady red. they were also larger than any running lights i have ever seen on any aircraft."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.168877,+-105.094058(20665)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20665) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-105.094058","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Longmont","There were no other sightings in Longmont on or around November 20th 2009"],"City":"Longmont","Latitude":"40.168877","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-11222009-0015","Summary":"Three large red lights with a flashing white strobe inside, very low altitude drifting 25 mph or less.","Case Number":"20665","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/20/2009 10:05 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Colorado","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20665.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20665.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/22/2009 06:42 UTC"}
