[b] incident at salt lake [\\b] - [b]seeds of understanding [\\b] wednesday, august 15, marks the day of one of the strangest in my entire life. it also offers hope for countless abductees. since beginning this 'wave of sightings' this year, and experiencing perhaps 25 - 30 individual sightings involving over 100,000 (yes that's right) craft, and combined with the information stored will all the other members, the nlb (nasty little b.......) may now want to pick up their toys and go home, as it will not be much fun for them anymore. [i]assuming of course, that people pay attention and respond to this message[\\i]. i should have seen it coming. i was warned. more than once. i had other clues too but i couldn't or wouldn't pay attention, as it was exciting simply to see the craft. and i saw plenty of them. probably 10 different varieties. close up. after checking my messages here last night, i left shortly after 8. my 'new friends' were outside waiting. they always seemed most patient and accommodating, except for their choice of meeting location. clue number 2. (1 is coming up) i took their 'signal' (manipulated cloud formation of the front of my car) to correctly interpret i was to drive. so i got into my car and started following the 'star' which was an orange color. easy to see, they made sure of that. i followed the star for about a mile, then thought i had lost it. however, i quickly picked it up again, but this time it was low on the horizon, indicating i was close to my destination. my pulse quickened. the meeting was close! sure enough my hosts led me down a steep hill that ended at a fence. this meant i had to get out of my car and walk. clue number 3. (why didn't they just have me walk to begin with?- answer coming up later) i got it, flushed with excitement at this new chapter in my new book of life. surely this had to be most of the most eventful events in the history of mankind. contact, intelligent and cooperative contact, with a completely different society of people outside our own reality. what a trip. so i got to the fence, which was locked and had a 'no trespassing' sign on it. well, obviously this didn't apply to me, did it? why would a little thing like locks and signs apply to someone who was about to bring a message to mankind? clue number 4. i quickly jumped the fence and headed in the only direction i could. i was at the end of a gully, so i made my way through. i quickly saw a circular craft not too far! wow, i thought to myself, see? this is way easier than what they had me doing last night, traipsing through dense foliage and across rivers. finally, someone gets it. well, i got to another fence in short order. no problem, i just climbed over. i saw another craft in the distance, this was a saucer ( i differentiate between disc and saucer - while both are circular, the disc is similar to the shape of a black checker, without the little bumps on the edge. it also has 4 rows of square shaped windows but with rounded corners. a saucer is black and smooth, with tapered edges. actually very cool looking.) well, i continued through the pasture ( i was at the bottom of a gully which people had converted mostly to pasture for livestock) and quickly ran into what i thought was my first obstacle: wild and hostile horses. for those of you who know horses only as either tame or fearful of humans, this may be a shock: they were coming to get me. however, my 'new friends' turned on a very bright white light and this scared them off. hooray for them! aren't they great? well, i got to the end of that pasture, and found another fence. this was a typical cyclone fence topped with razor and barb wire. wow. it's getting tough now. suddenly a bright light was switched on from the direction the barn and the beam was being swept in a side to side motion. oh no! they are going to catch me there and what am i going to say? i am following et? yeah right. well, i ducked down and waited, actually frozen with fear. i didn't want this opportunity to pass me by. well, no worries. i think either she gave up or my et 'friends' had someone 'convinced' her that everything was ok. on with the show. and i mean that literally, as you will find out later. so i managed to climb the fence and avoid the 'attack horses', the cow pies and road apples and got to yet another fence. this one was just a 'paddock type' fence, so i easily slid under the wooden slats and almost raced to et just a little way away. wow, what a beautiful disc! about 60 or so feet across, and perhaps 25 feet high. it had four rows of windows, described above, and various lights of red and blue and white. stunning! well, no sooner had i picked up speed than the craft slowly and carefully made its way down the field, just outside my reach. ok, i thought, obviously this is too close to the house and it wants some privacy. no problem. so i continued on my journey and found an almost insurmountable obstacle: a fence too high to climb and no way to get around. i almost panicked, trying to think of a way to overcome this new roadblock. while walking around and testing the fence periodically, almost the way a cat challenges its space, i suddenly heard a voice say quite clearly, and in english \"over here\". so i looked around and saw blue and orange 'flashlight lights' moving along the ground. i went to the where i heard the voice and said hello in a stage whisper. no answer. i couldn't see anybody, i could just hear voices, in english, and no accent. (this particular incident may prove to be very useful in the later analysis.) i can't tell you how relieved i was to hear english. well, finally i saw 2 or three people, looking just as you or i would. they went around the corner of the barn, i thought perhaps to try to find a way to help me over. after waiting for what seemed a long time, and not seeing them again, i started to form a plan to find a strong limb or piece of wood to put up against the fence and climb over. suddenly i heard a female voice saying \"i don't think he wants this bad enough. he couldn't even find the bike path\". i instantly felt panicky. ���no, no, i can do this���, i thought to myself. suddenly, inspiration. i took off my boots and used my toes to climb the fence. it had barb and razor wire, and i ripped my socks and shirt, but hey. it's worth it right? i am going to meet et! and this is clue number 5. well, i put my boots back on, grabbed my binoculars and started down the bike path, thinking to myself \"umm, you guys might have let me know there was a perfectly legal, safe and easier way of getting here\" when suddenly i saw a male and female behind me, with a funny little blue light on the ground in front of them and they seemed to be on bikes. although, i can't tell you that for sure. isn't that funny? i can describe the craft in detail, but i can't tell you a thing about what they were riding, although they had to be bikes, right? right? so i quickly yelled out \"hi!\" and the guy responded, somewhat reluctantly, \"hi\" but in a weak voice, and they both continued on the path. that's funny i thought, but oh well, let's get going. clue number 6. well, i quickly saw lights in the distance, the disc. so i headed in that direction until i came to an area dense with foliage. the craft was sitting in the middle of that, and there was the 'guiding light' above me, basically directing me to go through the brush to get to the craft. so, very reluctantly, i complied. i don't know what the name of this stuff is, but it's almost like bamboo, grassy yet strong, and many 'stalks' per square foot. very hard to get through. extremely. plus, it grows very, very tall, perhaps 20 feet. it's so thick that it blocks the light. luckily, i had my little mag-light, which made it a little easier, but not very much. so i struggled through that, and came to a short little concrete wall. with a little difficulty, i climbed it and headed toward the craft. it backed away, beckoning me further still through this brushy nightmare. i came to yet another 'wall of brush' but i could see that et was just on the other side of it. thinking this was finally the end, i plunged on. very, very difficult stuff to get through, it grabbed my clothes and hair, and the stalks were so thick in places i could not move them, so i had to step on them and use it kind of as a ladder placed on the ground. aren't i clever, i congratulated myself. victory is at hand! well, i took another step and -- into soft gooey mud. all the way to my knee. i tried to pull it out, and it took such a struggle i almost passed out from panic. it was dark, cold, wet, smelly, and i was stuck in a place no one would find me. the only thing which kept me from panicking was the knowledge that et would surely rescue me. so no worries. well, i finally managed to pull out of the muck, but there was no way i could cross there. so i explored up and down the river bank, testing with my boot on the river bottom. i finally found a place, that, although muddy, would support my weight. i finally managed to reach the end--right into more bamboo stuff. man, i thought. will this stuff never end? i can't really explain the effect this stuff had on me. almost claustrophobic. once you went in, it closed you off from the world. it wouldn't let any light, even starlight in, and the flashlight was really useless, since it couldn't 'see' through the brush anymore than i could. plus, it was just plain hard to push through. but i was on a mission and i was going to complete it! no way was this going to beat me down. i felt a bit giddy at my determination. well, finally, i was through every obstacle! the marshes, the reeds, the goo. and there it was, waiting for me! but wait - the orange light came on behind me, across the marshes i had just crossed! was he kidding? i had to cross back through that junk? what??? what is this, i thought, some kind of test? maybe they want to see just how strong i am. that girl earlier said something about how 'he didn't want it bad enough'. oh yeah? i'll show them. but let me ask you something-- have you ever experienced something distasteful, something you knew you would never want to do, and having done it, and faced with doing it a second time, found it to be far more difficult than the first time? i think that's because we know now what it is like, rather than just thinking it. remember, those reeds are extremely claustrophobic, i was wearing tall boots and carrying binoculars. but i figured, hey i can do this, and then we can have a meeting. so...i turned back, experienced the very same difficulties, the very same emotions, and the very same results. that's right. after going through this very challenging thing for the second time, et jumped across the marsh and told me to do it yet again!! omg. omg. what - for real?? i was so tired, but i wasn't going to give up. i knew i had to do this. people were counting on me to bring them a message. i paused for a few minutes, building up my strength. i forged ahead. it was so hard this time. i was hyperventilating, i was wet and cold, and so thirsty. but i couldn't drink this fetid marsh water. every step was a struggle, and then--i came to a blockade of trees. thick branches. no way to get through. i stopped, considering my situation. maybe i could go up a bit and find a break through the tree trunks. i stopped, tried one, and couldn't get through. so i went up a little further and squeezed one leg through, but i couldn't get the other one through. so i tried it from another angle, and lo and behold!- victory. but that wasn't the end. i still had another marsh to traverse, completely with stick and smelly goo, and those terrible, horrible reeds which closed up around you. well, i finally broke through the last reed - right back to where i had started! no, no, no. what happened? did i make a 'wrong turn' around those tree trunks? i gotta tell ya, i just about lost it right there. and you know what? et said do it again. that's right. again. no i said. no. no. i have done enough. i have proved myself, i am not doing it again. et wouldn't budge. so i decided to go home, and you know what? i discovered i was in the middle of the marsh, not at the end as i had thought. so either way, i had to go through it again. ���no!,��� i thought again. et should just land right here, and we can have a meeting. so i yelled out, ���land here. i am not doing this again! i am too tired, give me a break!��� but et wouldn't budge. and i wouldn't budge. so finally i just laid down in the small clearing and waited for et to come get me. minutes passed. nothing. i was so tired. so thirsty. i can't do it, i thought to myself. it's so hard to break through that stuff, so hard to find a place to cross the gooey mud. so hard. so hard. et still wouldn't budge. ���ok!��� i yelled out to the cursed orange light. ok!! we'll do it your way! so...taking big breaks, praying for strength, and using sheer will power, i finally, finally did it for the fourth time. done. i am done. i am going home. i don't care anymore, this is just goofy. suddenly i saw the craft land just where i had been. so now what? all i need to do is cross just one more time and they will meet me? just one? hmmm. well, since i am writing this, you have to know that i didn't do it. it would have killed me, for sure. i didn't fall for it this time. i just turned around and made it to the bike path. but... et had other plans. this time, a different craft, a sleek disc, popped in and hovered gently above the ground just a few yards from me. i can't properly explain how cool it is to see something like that gently bobbing and swaying back and forth above the ground. it truly is something to see. so i made my way to the ship--and it backed up. just a little way. i continued to chase it. it kept backing up. finally right next to some houses that framed the pasture and marsh i was on. right next to them. in some cases, directly above the house, almost 'capping' the roof. basically the same size as the house. suddenly i saw 3 more discs. but these were different. they were still round, still black, and about the same size, but they had a pointed top come down to the wide edge of the saucer. kind of like a stinger on top of a checker, but with the point sloping down on all sides to the wide edge of the disc. maybe, i thought, maybe these guys will meet with me. so i started toward them. obviously, i had still not given up hope that perhaps et would relent and give me a chance to meet with them personally. but it seemed that they were...a bit afraid of me? i don't know, that didn't make sense, given the extremely advanced stage of their technology. why, then, would they not meet me in person? i was determined to do something - almost anything- to show them i could be trusted. what a laugh. these guys can never be trusted. ever. but at that point, under extreme fatigue, my ego bruised but still alive, a little crazed with thirst and feet blistered, i was in no condition for rational thought. it was as though it wasn't me doing this. when i look back, a mere 24 hours ago, it seems already a lifetime has passed. it could not have been real, yet i know absolutely for certain it was. what are these guys doing here? all these thoughts, yet none of them conscious, were here. then i saw what i call the bobber up ahead. it was about 100 feet in diameter, with a dark gold bottom and top, and a wide red band in the middle. there was something 'attached' i think to it. this was dark gold all around and had an acorn-shape to it. i call it the lure. it was doing something. it seemed like it was moving, going higher or twisting in a radical way, very fast. it didn't go very far, and it was hard to see in the dark and at a distance of about 500 feet. whatever. i turned my attention to the black checker to see if it was still there. it was. so - now don't judge me here, i couldn't think - i went ahead and started for it. i went up to the trailheads, one was 'walkers' and the other 'riders' (i guess horses were allowed there), and i chose the 'horses', thinking that perhaps it would be more scenic and therefore more attractive to et. why, i don't know. these parasites do not care about anything scenic. i know that now. i didn't then. anyway, i got further and further into the trail, and i kept watching the black checker. i noticed it had moved into the marsh. but finally, i knew there was no way i was going in that hell-hole. i knew it, and it kind of relaxed me yet angered me at the same time. if i wasn't going into the marsh, then i knew in the back of my mind i would never meet et. but if that was the case, then why was i still pursuing the black checker? you can see the state of my mind at that time. no rational thought, yet still capable of making decisions. it was a crazy time, and one that thankfully is over. but is it? well, you can make that decision later. right now, et is still within reach. i thought. i continued to see the stingers and the sleek. always within reach, always unreachable. and of course, the light escort which was always present. always beckoning me into the marsh. i turned to go back to the main street. i just wanted to get something to drink. looking for a gas station, an all night store, anything to get something to drink. i got back to the little park area and noticed a drinking fountain! yessss! you can't imagine how excited i was to find a little drinking fountain. the water wasn't even cold, but it was the best tasting ever. if i went back there today, it probably wouldn't taste as good, but at that point, it was ambrosia. isn't it funny how that happens? anyway, i got back onto the main boulevard. all the constant traffic somehow gave me comfort, but et wasn't done with me yet. he still had plans to make me suffer. at least that's what i think he was doing. he didn't want me dead, i don't think. clue number 6. the light escort was up there, insistent in its presence. i yelled to it \"get me home, i am lost!\" it seemed to understand, i thought at that time, so i followed it. remember, i am fatigued, bruised-both physically and in my ego- and in no condition for rational thought. so i followed the small comfort i remembered early in my relationship with the light escort. i walked for what seemed like miles, always seeing the one thing which never came down from the sky - the triangles. now, i want to make something very clear here. there are different triangles. the first night i went out in hopes of meeting et, a thin triangle about 40 feet from point to point had landed and put out what i think was a staircase lighted a dull orange. i never got close enough to verify that, but i am pretty sure that was it. however, these triangles are so enormous not even a football field could accommodate them. and there are many. many. so there they were, out of sight, yet it plain view. to those who notice that is. most of us are so busy just existing that we sometimes never learn to live. and so et seems to know that, and take advantage of it. how else could the black checker be a mere 20 feet off the ground and have all these cars zooming under it and not one car ever stops, slows down, or seems to notice? so i continued my long journey home. every step, heavy with marsh water, slopping inside my boots. huge blisters on my feet. every step filled with lead, and taking enormous effort just to put one foot in front of the other. i looked around for a cab. not one. i continued to follow the light escort. maybe it would give me a break. again, what a laugh as you will see. but perhaps i, that is we, will have the last laugh. perhaps. on the way home, et was still - can the word be 'hopeful' with these guys? it continued to send the black checker my way, and one more thing. something about twice as big, and shaped almost like an elongated version of an m&m. i'll call it the zot, which i think is the generic version of the candy. it, too, was black, about, oh 45 feet high, and perhaps 100 feet long. it too had 3 or 4 stories of windows, square but rounded at the edges. it too has a really cool appearance, but remember, it's full of really goofed-up people. if you can call them that. and i don't know that it's full of anything (well...) but why else would it be so big and have so many lighted windows? if they were windows, which of course, it's possible they're not. anyway, i continued to make my way home. in slc, they have a numbered grid system of streets that basically starts at zero from the temple, then moves out at 1st st north, 1st st east, 1st street south, and 1st st west. it progresses down the line, and i was at something like 80th east and 120 south. i think. directions are something which are a bit foreign to me, and i get lost easily. anyway, i was now over a freeway, and so i looked around to see if i could see any recognizable landmarks, which is my preferred way of navigation. i saw something which both chilled and fascinated me. now, i have spent a lot of time thinking about what i am going to leave out of this report. there are things that, it seems to me, would not be fair to tell you about. you simply have no way of verifying them, and they are so frightening, it could be cruel and would serve no purpose other than that. i am still thinking about that, but i am still going to leave out some things of this report, and may possibly report them later. but i will tell you this: suspended above the freeway, in plain view, right next to the overpass, was the zot. right there. but that's not what horrified me. one of the things i will tell you is from my vantage point i saw numerous huge triangles suspended over the city. maybe 5. maybe more. and something else. oh my gosh, this is so...weird it's hard to believe. there was an extremely long, gently curving object, full of lights and lighted windows. i can't even tell you how long it was, but it seemed like a mile long. seriously. elegant in its design, and frightening, simply by its appearance there. it kind of reminded me of a boomerang. why was it there, and more importantly, why did people not seem to care? this thing was in plain sight. as were the triangles, the zot, and the black checker. as were the stingers, the sleek, and the light escort, which had now grown to at least 2. here's something else. something i had never connected until now. there is an airport here, not the salt lake, but another one, i don't know the name. anyway, there have always been two 'towers' there, but there was something weird about them. wait, let me go check something, i'll be right back. ****end part i**** this is the second of a two-part report. this report, unfortunately, is completely true. incident at salt lake - part ii wow. i am in shock, but i am still going to do my report. i don't mind telling you, what i just saw has me shaking. the boomerang is out there. in the distance, but still there. it's something i had never seen before from this location. also, the two objects, the 'towers' are there as well. one is a triangle, huge, and the other is a rectangle, about the same size. when i point them out to people, they just casually say it's airport towers. that's garbage. they are absolutely plain to see. and now things are starting to connect. perhaps i am not alone in this after all, or perhaps something backfired on et. i think i can see things other people cannot. now before you jump on this as 'evidence' of something psychotic, let me assure you i am as sane as anyone else. but here is what i think happened: in order to play this little game with me, et had to give me something: special sight. how else would you explain all these craft in the middle of the city and no one noticing? the only other thing i can think of is the possibility that my pleiadian friends are real and are assisting in the background. they are the ones who altered my sight to be able to see what's really going on. and i think i know how they did it, whoever 'they' are. about 2 days ago, i started noticing a black, small, very fast object occasionally zip into view and be gone. it would be followed by a flash of light, and then something would head toward me. it looked like a saucer which was cloaked. by 'cloaked' i mean it would seem to be made of water which had ripples in it. it would do something to me. i don't know what, but i would see flashes of light, mainly red. i think that either it altered my dna, my brain frequency, my vision, or all three or some combination. at any rate, allow me to change my estimate of the size of the boomerang: it's at least 5 miles long. and half a mile high. there are other things out there two. i think there are more rectangles and triangles. they're way in the distance, so it's hard to tell. i am in so much shock right now, it's really hard to type. what could be going on, and why can i see this? it's truly unbelievable, i wish i had a camera. i wonder if it would show up. i can't even remember where i was in the story, i need to re-read. hold on a second. oh ok. i am over the freeway, seeing all the same things i am seeing now. but from this location, from which i had never been able to see the boomerang before. did it move or am i just now able to see it for some unexplained reason? let me get my thoughts together. this is so unbelievable. what could be going on?? ok, back to the story. well, i noticed all these things over the freeway, and apparently no one else did. i continued walking, trying to find a landmark, when bingo! i saw a great one. it was wal-mart, very close, relatively, from my boss's house. at least i could navigate my way home from there. i made my way in that direction, but i couldn't find a way to get across the freeway. in my fatigued state, i didn't realize that i could walk across the freeway only over an overpass. and even though i was on an overpass, it wasn't the 'right' one. so i started walking parallel to the freeway hoping to find another one. soon, i actually found an all-night store and rushed in to get something to drink. one of the night clerks greeted me, and he seemed friendly enough. so i asked him to come outside to see if he could see the zot. he said sure, he would come take a look. and you know what he saw? lights. that's all. just lights. he said they were probably 'airport tower lights'. oh my gosh. does everyone think that every unexplainable light is a tower light? these things are so easy to see. is everyone hypnotized or something? well, i bought my drinks, gatorade was on special, and so was coke, so i got two of each, and continued to make my way home. then i saw a stinger 'hiding' just off the freeway. it seemed to beckon me over, but i was having none of it. well, almost none of it. i was still curious. so i continued to watch it, but still make my way home. i looked up to see if i could see the light escort. it was there. i followed it. it was so painful walking. just lifting up a foot required enormous effort. i could barely lift my feet up enough to avoid shuffling them. i looked around, saw a costco, and made my way in that direction. why i don't know. maybe because it was familiar. i got to costco, and saw wal-mart across the street, but still could not cross. i had to find another way. so i walked perpendicular to the freeway, until i could find a road that would be parallel, so i could get to another overpass. i have never, ever, been as exhausted as i was that night. but i finally made it to another overpass, and this time, it was the right one. i can't tell you how happy i was to finally know i was truly headed in the right direction. yet all the time, the huge triangles were above me. as well as the light escorts. why i needed two now i don't know. anyway, i made my way across the overpass, and back toward wal-mart. and the light escort was not giving up. now it knew that i knew my way home, i guess. it kept beckoning me in the opposite direction. and here is where i made, i believe, one of my greatest discoveries: when asked a direct question about its orientation, all it can do is not answer, but it cannot lie. there is a big difference here and i want to make it clear: it can lie, but not about its orientation. and by that i mean, either something in an advanced state of evolution is oriented toward service to others, or it is oriented to service to self. the sts are the 'bad' ones. as a test, (it seems i am thinking now and i think i know the reason which i will tell you later), i told the light escort that it seems that was the wrong direction. i asked it, \"i want to go home, is that really the right direction?\" to which it 'nodded' vigorously. i then asked it \" are you service to others? and it would not reply. i asked it again. nothing. at that point, i was actually elated. this is a huge discovery. i don't know why, but at that level of evolution i guess, the 'rules' change and when confronted, an sts entity simply cannot say it is service to others. all it can do is let you assume it is. so now, i had the advantage. i knew how to get home, but i was so fatigued it was like i was drunk. punch drunk. i had taken a beating, but i was still standing. barely. i finally made it back to wal-mart, and went inside hoping they could call me a cab. i was only a couple of miles away, but it may as well have been twenty. or a hundred. i asked the greeter if she could call me a cab. she said no, but there was a phone book in the lobby. i went over to the payphone and grabbed the phonebook. at this point, i was absolutely consumed with fatigue. i nearly fainted. right at the point of collapse, i woke up and regained my footing. again and again this happened. i couldn't really focus enough to make a call. and for some reason, i couldn't see the area code for the taxi. so i took a chance and used my cellular phone to make the call, using the 801 slc area code. a male voice answered. so i apologized, hung up, and decided to make the walk home. and as usual, the light escort was present. always present. i ignored it, but continued to watch it. what i mean is, i didn't follow its directions, but i was always aware of where it was. when i got to the intersection where i was supposed to turn, it blinked furiously, wanting me to go the opposite direction. so again i asked if that was the way home, and again it responded in the affirmative. and again i asked if it was positively oriented service to others , and again it remained silent. so i told it to leave me alone. i was making progress. but i still had to get my car. and then i remembered where i parked it: down the ravine, not far from where i was! i was on a roll now. almost unaware of the pain, i continued walking. i noticed a truck drive beside me. he seemed to slow down, and at that point, thinking anything was possible, i wondered if et had somehow changed its mode of transportation. i looked up to see a the driver slow down and look at me, then continue on. at the entrance to the ravine, he stopped. ���what now?��� i thought. is it my car? what's wrong? he drove slowly down the steep embankment and disappeared. it took me several minutes to get to the entrance after the little truck went through it. i saw him parked right next to my car, and in my fatigue, thought i saw him inside it! i quickened my pace as best i could, and took out my phone, 911 at the ready. i got closer and realized no one was in it, and the driver was asleep in his truck. i almost laughed, got in my car, and drove home. and you know what? i still slept outside, et be damned. some of you may think that was the wrong decision, but let me tell you what i think. i think they have the technology to 'get me' wherever i am. therefore, it's just plain goofy to change my entire life when it doesn't make any difference to them anyway. i did notice all the triangles, sure. i don't think i saw the light escort. i did see the 'airport tower lights' and another light off in the distance. but i still slept. conclusion - or a new beginning? it's been only two days since this walking nightmare. what i am going to give you now is my opinion based on the facts of what happened, together with some intuition, some independent research, and some things i have learned from other people, including recently. i am still having some trouble grasping it, taking it in, figuring out what it means. that's where you come in. that's where we all come in. or, as ben franklin puts it \" unless we all hang together, we shall all hang separately.\" ready? we have been invaded. there is no easy way to put it. i saw them. people talk about coming invasions. people: they are already here. now. in spaceship-cities literally miles long. many of them. i have seen them only in slc so far, but i have just acquired this ability and have not yet been anywhere else. i don't know for sure why they are here, or what they want, but i will throw out some ideas. next we'll talk about what to do about it. always remember: what happened out there is fact, what i am going to tell you about the 'why' is opinion. everything i told you about is fact. everything. i have left out some particularly frightening things, only because it would serve no purpose other than to scare you. there is no other reason to let you know about these things. other than that, it's the truth and the whole truth. now i give you my opinion, based on considerable reading and other research. i am asking that we all contribute to these ideas, in the spirit of love and cooperation. i will ignore all fear-based comments. i believe that representatives of our government made a deal, in closed doors without public authorization with these nlbs in the mid 1950s. it included an exchange of technology for 'borrowing' some people for their own twisted research. using that research, the nlbs adapted their technology to be able to live among us virtually unnoticed. why? why are they here? well - and again, this is based on some earlier research, coupled with my observations that night - i think they use our emotions as 'drugs'. or food even. i don't know which. remember the bobber? i saw it doing some strange stuff, and always in the background. i saw it over the city, and i saw it 'connect' to the boomerang in some weird pre-dawn ritual. i think it was feeding that boomerang city. i think it figures out what makes people tick and then pushes their buttons for their own twisted ends. in other words, it stimulates us to create drama, then feeds off that. now, i am not saying we are not responsible for our own actions. far from that, and i think that is central to the way we get rid of these monsters. what i am saying is that it's hard not to cry when you slam your hand in the car door. can you do it? sure. but it's hard, and may involve 'repressing some emotion' or whatever. i am not a psychologist, but i have heard about repressing emotions and that it's not a good thing. but again, i am saying we use the tremendous intelligence we have even just here to figure this thing out together. also, and again in my opinion, even they have 'rules' by which they must obey. it's great. we can use those rules to our complete advantage. first, no physical harm must come to anyone they encounter, by their means. they can ���inspire��� you to put yourself in a situation where you can be killed. i think that���s the greatest victory for them. i know that an 'encounter' with them is not pleasant, or without some kind of harm. for a good reason, which i will explain, that's ok. we're talking here about physical harm, not mental or emotional. the reason for that is that we are supposed to be in charge of our mental processes and our emotions. but as i said before, if we're provoked or stimulated in a certain way, it's really hard not to react. but there are ways. there are ways. remember: we may not always be in charge of what happens to us, but we are always in charge of how we choose to react to it. we live on the only planet of choice in the entire galaxy. i'll explain more about that later. next, when confronted directly about their orientation, they cannot lie. however, it's critical that this bit of information not be twisted in any way. remember, when asked directly about their own orientation, then they cannot lie. they can lie about anything else. people eventually choose one of two orientations. either they choose service to others, which means they do things for other people at least 51% of the time, or they are service to self, which means they do things for themselves only, at least 95% of the time. they are 'allowed', according to these parameters, to do things for others 5% of the time or less. the vast majority of us fall somewhere in between those two figures (5 and 51). which means we are still growing, still maturing, still figuring out where we are in our orientation. we're not yet 'ready for harvest'. when we finally fulfill the parameters, when we finally reach the goal of either 51 or 95 percent, depending, then we move on to 'perfect' our orientation. no other planet in the galaxy has both sto and sts on it. this is a mixed planet, a planet of choice, and again, this is my opinion, the only planet like this in the entire galaxy. which is why we are so attractive to so many different people from other planets and places. getting back to the creation of drama, this is why they are here. if there is no drama, there is no reason for them to be here, and in fact, it may require them to leave. if you have no food in one place, you have got to find it someplace else. if your drug supply runs out, you need to go somewhere else to find it. in other words, if we choose to be a planet of peace, then they must leave. remember: no food means you either starve or find it someplace else. now, when i say it's the only planet of choice, that refers only to orientation. people on other planets make daily decisions just as we do. but it's in a different capacity, based on their orientation. here, we are constantly deciding if we're doing it for ourselves, or for others. in that respect, this is fascinating to people from other realities. remember i said that when confronted directly about their own orientation, they cannot lie? well, how do you 'confront them directly'? i am not speaking for you, but in my case, i asked the light escort yes or no questions and it responded by nodding (jumping up and down) in the affirmative. for example, i asked it: do i go this way? and it would respond either by jumping up and down for 'yes', or doing nothing for 'no'. i don't think they is a signal for 'no', simply because that due to their nature, they are always hoping you assume what they wish you to assume. they have absolutely no conscience at all. how would you do it without a light escort? you may not like this answer, but i think it means you need to use your intuition. i can't think of another way, but then again, i am not the only one here. we need to work together. do you get it? we all need to put down our petty childish ways, grow up, and figure this out. together. as one. then they must leave. get this: they have no choice in that matter. isn't that great? if we create peace, that's like taking that stuff they give you at the hospital to make you vomit. i can't remember the name right now, but you know what i am talking about. if you had a choice between taking that, or eating some delicious food, what would you do? however, as i said earlier, it's not a matter of them 'choosing' to stay with our peaceful ways. they must leave. no choice. so...what does a planet of peace mean? well, again, it's my own opinion -always remember that- it means not creating your own drama. certainly, we are allowed to defend ourselves. but that's not creating drama, technically, although we have the opportunity to 'co-create' it. we can drag it out, expand it, make it bigger. no. let's not do that. think for a minute what it would mean if people did not respond so quickly to provocation. what kind of planet would this be? what would it mean if we did not act so quickly to sue, to retaliate, to get revenge? what if, instead, we 'turned the other cheek'? again, and again, and again, this is my own opinion. i say this because people may be quick to take this is as 'gospel', because of the fact that i experienced something which possibly no one else ever has. i don't know. it's opinion. i can't prove it. but that's not the point. the point is to use your own intuition, your own set of values, your own ways to figure out ways to create peace, not drama. you know what? i truly believe it's that simple. of course, 'simple' does not necessarily mean 'easy', and in fact, usually means 'difficult'. as an example, it's a pretty simple concept to dig a hole 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet. not very easy though. let me know what you think. we need to work together on this. i make this pledge and i ask you to make it as well: i will no longer create drama. i will focus on allowing peace into my life. i will do this using my own set of values which i will never force on anyone. i will never initiate force of any kind. oh, i almost forgot. the first clue: i did indeed see a 'representative' of the invader. here is a description: spindly, about 5 feet tall the head comprised about 1\\3 of total body size. the eyes, which took up about 1\\2 the face and appeared to be dark brown, were bigger at the top than at the bottom. they glowed orange in my flashlight beam. i did not see the hands, so i can't tell you what they looked like. i did see the arms, which seemed to be longer in proportion to its body that what we have. it did not appear to be wearing clothes, and the skin color is between medium to dark brown. i did not see any genitals. the skin appeared to be somewhat dry, although i was never close enough to touch it myself. thankfully. finally, one last ps. i do not believe we are in this thing all alone. i do indeed believe i received a message from someone else. a representative of the service to others orientation. here's what happened: when i got close to wal-mart, and after asking again the orientation of the light escort, all of a sudden a small ball of light quickly rushed in. it got really close then zoomed away and hovered near me. i immediately asked it \" are you service to others?\" it nodded. vigorously. as if to say, \"hang in there, you're almost home.\" and \"we're going to help. but you need to actually do it yourself.\" pleiadians? perhaps. i did see a huge contingent of what i believe to be pleiadians. but whether they are or are not pleiadians is not in itself important. the important thing is, someone is going to help us. we're not alone. so there you have it. make peace. leave the drama. here again are two things to help you. 1. they cannot physically harm you, ever. don't believe for a second they can. they have driven many people to suicide. don't be on their success list. you are in control of how you choose to react to provocation. respond with love, not fear. 2. ask them directly about their orientation. say: \"are you service to others?\" and wait for the response. if you do not get a response, then they are not sto. never assume they are. remember, then can lie about anything else, but not this. let me know what you think. i am interested. peace. encounter at salt lake - alien craft list -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- this is, i believe, a complete list of all the alien craft i saw. i may make some minor description changes, but this is essentially completely accurate. i saw these things over a period of several hours and interacted with them. here then, is my description of 'the dirty dozen'. i have listed these mainly in the order of appearance. first, the black checker. a black disc-shaped craft similar in appearance to a 'checkers' game piece. it has 4 rows of (what appear to be ) windows, slightly rectangular but with rounded edges, lights of different colors -red, white, and blue- arranged around the top and bottom edges. there may also be lights on the top and bottom, it was hard to tell. they may look orange in the sky, but i wasn't able to confirm that. i call these the black checkers. the windows and lights go all the way around the craft. about 30 feet in diameter. second, the sleek. a saucer-shaped craft; it is almost the 'classic' craft with a slight dome and outer rim. somewhat reminiscent of a squashed witch's hat, but with an aerodynamic ( i guess that's the reason) raised edge. slightly curving up, but 'up and down' all around the rim, if you understand. black and very sleek-looking, i call it the sleek. this is slightly smaller than the checker, so about 20 feet across. third: the zot. a bigger, more rounded 'disc'. it's not really circular, but more elongated. reminds me in a way of a stretched m&m. also black, also 4 stories of what i assume to be 'windows', also slightly rectangular with rounded edges. the windows go all the way around, just as with the black checkers. i call this a \"zot\", because i think that's the generic name for what appears to be an m&m. perhaps 40 x 60 feet. fourth: the stinger. this looks exactly like a black checker, except it has a point on it which extends all the down to the edge of the rim of the black checker, but absolutely no windows, and come to think of it, i don't think i saw any lights, althought i did get a 'spotlight' on me a few times. it looks something like a pointed party hat on top of a black checker, but the 'pointy' part isn't as tall as that, it's much shorter. i started to call this a party hat, but changed the name to a stinger, which seems more appropriate. maybe in appearance more like a thumbtack, but with a wider, which is to say thicker, 'thumb' part, and the 'tack' is cone-shaped. fifth: the bobber. probably the most bizarre craft i saw that night, although that may be up for debate. this one looks like a fishing bobber, with a dark gold top and bottom, and a wide red stripe in the middle. it had something attached ( at least i think it was attached) to the upper right (from my perspective) 'quadrant' area. i call it a bobber. it may be about 100 in diameter. sixth: the lure, mentioned above, and probably just a part of the bobber. it is somewhat acorn-shaped, although maybe not with the 'ridge' of an acorn, and dark gold. i keep switching names for this, between the acorn and the lure. it feels better to call it the lure. that's the way i will keep it. about 10 x 15 feet. seventh: the bat. a miniaturized version of a black saucer. perhaps 1\\16 scale. it is extremely quick, and moves at right angles, and appears for only a nano-second, during which time it appears to quickly flash a bright light and then to release some kind of cloaked saucer which heads right to you. the cloaked saucer appears as it would if you could quickly stamp out a saucer shape on a rippled pond where you just threw a pebble. i call it a bat, because it's so quick your eyes don't have time to focus on it, and so it gives the impression, in an optical-illusion kind of way, of that small flying creature. eighth: the turnover. a triangle-shaped craft. there are two versions of which i am familiar. one i saw fairly close, the other was extremely high in the sky and must have been miles long. the one i saw fairly close was perhaps 'only' 500 feet to the side. however, perhaps to the dismay, or to the interest, of some researchers, it wasn't black. one of the few craft which was not black. this one appeared to be gold, but it had so many lights and windows on it that it was hard to tell. also, it appeared to have rounded edges, not squared-off sides as you might expect. kind of a 'puffy' triangle. ninth: the sponge. a rectangle, or perhaps a square: hard to tell, but i am leaning toward a rectangle. it also is gold, i think, with many lights and windows just all over it. also about 500 feet to the side. tenth: the carousel. a disc, about the same size as the previous two, except circular. also gold, with lights and windows all over it. eleventh: the jetson. a disc shaped craft, but this one is hard for me to describe in as good a detail, because i think i saw it in two parts at two different times: front, and back, and at two different times. it closely resembles the 'family car' in the jetsons. black, saucer-shaped, although it may be more oval than circular, with two 'exhaust' ( i never saw any 'exhaust', but that is what they seem to be) ports. a clear dome on top, but just big enough for their huge heads, not the 'all-over' dome in the jetson-mobile. nevertheless, i call it the jetson. note: this craft may be the one which resembles, in speed and sound, a typical jet. i saw this in action. it sounds exactly as a jet would, if this is the same craft i saw from the front. as i said, i never saw the entire craft, front and back, at the same time, so i am not completely sure. but i am fairly certain the jetson is the 'jet-imitator' i have personally seen in action. 20 x 25 if, oval. if not, then about 20 feet across. twelfth: boomerang city. the granddaddy of them all. an absolutely huge boomerang-shaped craft, just filled with lights and windows. staggering in its proportions. i am going to be extremely conservative here and say it was 1 mile to each 'wing'. at least 1\\4 mile high. i get chills just thinking about this monstrosity, this city of parasites. it's unbelievably big. also gold-colored, i think. it was so hard to tell with all the lights and windows. in other words, it could have been silver, or even white, reflecting back all the lights. i have noticed a common element among most of these craft, and it's that they usually have red, white, and blue lights. i believe this is intentional so as to let them appear to be conventional craft at times. i have seen them do this very thing. i have seen them change from a stationary bright light to a slow-moving craft flashing red and blue lights, resembling, course, a helicopter. they appear not to have mastered, as yet, the sound of a helicopter. no sound at all. nb: i have seen helicopters with bright search lights remain stationary, then turn off the light and begin moving again. this is not the same thing of which i am speaking here. i think that's all. at least that's all i can think of for now. i wish us all peace in our lifetimes."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Cone, Circle, Disc, Flash, Oval, Sphere, Square, Rectagular, Triangle, Other","Object Flight
