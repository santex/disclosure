Once again my girlfriend just got home she works nights and i went out on the balcony to look at the moon one last time before it went down and it came from the west. I immediatly called my girlfriend out and we watched it for about 2 and a half minutes then i ran in put my shoes on and chased it on foot for about 3 minutes. As soon as i ran home i jumped on the computer and checked for satilite locations and the closest one was over mexico around mexico city so i know it wasnt a satilite. Im very excited and wont be going back to bed this morning."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16846.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16846.html"],"Longitude":"-123.076844","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/09/2009 05:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"44.053779","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/09/2009 05:10 UTC"}
