{"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son and I were outside observing the moon through his telescope, it was around 10:00 AM, and as we were setting it up I noticed an object out of the corner of my eye, that I thought was a bird, I said what is that? And we both could not identify it. We tried to watch it through the telescope but could not focus on it. At that point I went in the house to get my video camera. We could see it with our eyes, but it took a while to focus on it with the camera. The video is 4:56 seconds, the object can be seen from 1:20 seconds on. The object appeared silver in color and at times reflected the sun light and changed to a dark almost black color. It was not in a direct ���flight pattern���, it hovered, and at times moved in a circular motion. It changed color at one point, from silver to black, and we were like this is nothing like we have ever seen before. We have noticed objects at night, but this was definitely a first. We lost site of it by the object going up .You can hear us on the video and the object can be seen at times before we notice it."],"Case Number":"41707","Date Submitted":"08/13/2012 11:18 UTC","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Bay Shore","There were no other sightings in Bay Shore on or around August 9th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/09/2012 10:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.748463","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.748463,+-73.261928(41707)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41707) map </A>","Longitude":"-73.261928","Log Number":"US-08132012-0015","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41707.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41707.html"],"Summary":"Outside with my son observing the moon through his telescope and noticed and object","City":"Bay Shore"}
