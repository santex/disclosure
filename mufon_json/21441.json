We had just entered a small town called Little Valley, an area between Earlington and Nortonville when we saw the \"UFO\". Both my boyfriend and I saw two lights up in the air and quickly looked up. It was a white craft, shaped like missile, and had two white lights attached. At first, for a split second, I thought it was a plane or something, but then it dove down from the sky as if had crashed into something. There were no noises, no crash sounds, no evidence that it had even touched ground. We kept driving, trying to collect ourselves, and as we drove back after dropping him off, we saw nothing else out of the norm."],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21441.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21441.html"],"Case Number":"21441","Object Flight Path":"Other","Longitude":"-87.452777","Tags":"City","Latitude":"37.190878","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Nortonville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"01/11/2010 03:45 UTC","Date of the Event":"01/09/2010 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Seen While Driving"}
