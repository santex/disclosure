{"Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI have spotted satellites reflecting the sun in the night sky from the comfort of the hot tub hundreds of times, this one was different. One night my wife Tracie and I were walking to the car and I happened to look up. The night sky was crystal clear and the stars were bright. I saw a moving pinpoint of light traveling in a Northerly direction. I pointed it out to Tracie and we both watched it for about 45 seconds, until the point of light made a dead left turn without slowing down at all. We watched for another 20 or so seconds until the point of light desappeared over the trees."],"trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around July 31st 2001"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27088.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27088.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.960275","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"27088","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12242010-0005","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Philadelphia","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/31/2001 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"oblect that looked like a satellite reflecting the sun made an instant 90 degeree left turn","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.960275,+-75.161539(27088)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27088) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-75.161539","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/24/2010 10:25 UTC"}
