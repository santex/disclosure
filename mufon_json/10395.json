I thought that it was a shooting start and then it moved back the opposite direction and stopped in a hover . I called to my mom and it shot back the other way and right back to a hover . I would say that it was at least 5 to 10 miles away . The thing that was most noticeable was the flashing and pulsing of VERY intense ever changing lights . When it was close to us we could see the front end was round but the lights were the weird thing . They would go from red to maroon to blue and yellow they were like the intensity of lightning I would guess . We watched it between calling everyone i knew for almost 50 minutes. It would dart back and forth but only in short jumps not like when i first saw it . I even called 911 and asked if anyone had reported anything . They said no but that they would call the FAA and let me know if they said anything and they never did call back . I am not crazy i wouldnt have believeed it if i hadnt seen it .Finally we went in because it was getting cold and i looked again and it was gone when i peeked back out the door . I tried to take pictures , but i couldnt get the stupid flash to stop working on the camera , and to be honest i was to wound up to think straight . I am not crazy and i was a skeptic , but what we saw was not like anything like anything man made I have ever seen"],"Longitude":"-68.770534","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.807342,+-68.770534(10395)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10395) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"44.807342","Object Shape":"Disc, Flash","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"round object with many very very bright pulsating lights that changed colors aat random","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Maine","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04182008-0005"}
