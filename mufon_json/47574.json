This is just an air plane that can confuse people. Its black plane with a single red light the top or bottom of the plane. I could make out the surface of the plane and it looks like the shape of the B2. When the planes are crossing the horizon. You just see this solid red light on that looked like a break light, but not flashing. Its pretty bright or it was really close. not sure. Its when the plane changes directions is when we light seems to just disappear. I only got lucky in the fact that there was a enough back ground lighting from Liberty MO to see the outline of the plane. I have actually seen them a few times since December, but figured I would post this after I had a neighbor ask me about them. Guess it confused him."],"Date Submitted":"05/22/2013 12:31 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47574.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47574.html"],"Longitude":"-94.550587","Latitude":"39.206112","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05222013-0010","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.206112,+-94.550587(47574)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47574) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON"}
