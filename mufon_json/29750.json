{"Date Submitted":"06/27/2011 06:02 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family and I were sky-watching at the end of a birthday party. Unfortunately, the sky was somewhat overcast; it remained too light to see many stars, and we never did see the moon. As we were wrapping up and putting chairs away, a bright light suddenly caught my eye. I turned around, anxious to see what I believed was the moon finally making an appearance. But to my great surprise, I saw a small white light ��� very bright, flying across the sky, and it was encircled by very large cream-colored glow. Note that there were no clouds specifically; the sky just seemed rather gray. I was surprised that the glow was so large, circular, and bright, yet assumed it was somehow an airplane behind a fog or clouds. Still, since our sky-watch had been uneventful, I pointed up and tried to get everyone���s attention. However, I found myself fumbling my words, because, as I spoke, the glow didn���t fade in and out of any clouds as I would have expected, rather it began to shrink evenly around the center light until it was no longer there. What���s more, as the rest of my family looked up, the glowing vanished, and we all witnessed the object suddenly come to a halt. We were thoroughly bemused and unsure as to what we���d actually just seen. Had the object vanished and we were now looking at a star���or was the flying object still there and truly standing still? Nothing unorthodox happened after that point. As to the size of the object, to cover it if I held something at arm's length, I would have to use a pencil eraser to cover the center light, and a quarter to cover the entire glow. Also, the glow was a perfectly shaped circle, not irregular or faded in any way. I have no photos."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"29750","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There were no other sightings in Independence on or around June 26th 2011"],"Summary":"Bright white light encircled by very large cream-colored glow.","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/26/2011 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.095376","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29750.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29750.html"],"Tags":"City","City":"Independence","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.095376,+-94.413997(29750)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29750) map </A>","Region":"Missouri","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-94.413997","Log Number":"US-06272011-0009","Object Shape":"Circle"}
