It was a bright white light with no strobing affects. After watching it travel to my zenith position at a 45 degree angle, I began to watch it with my binoculars. It was heading due south with all the appearance of a satellite when at 40 degrees from the southerly horizon it suddenly stopped and reversed it's direction without ever changing velocity. I was freeking out because I knew that what I had just witnessed was totally impossible. It returned over the exact path that it had traveled till it slowed and faded out at true westerly position @ 45 degrees from my view point. I did not see it anymore past that point. I have seen many strange things recently, but this is one is the most bizarre. I am still perplexed about this!"],"Longitude":"-86.780843","Date Submitted":"03/15/2009 07:40 UTC","Summary":"Single bright light @ 400 MPH +/- suddenly reversed direction.","Latitude":"36.1743","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There were no other sightings in Nashville on or around March 15th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-03172009-0020","Region":"Tennessee","City":"Nashville","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
