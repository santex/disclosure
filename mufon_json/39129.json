East to west.","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting Details I was sunbathing sitting about 45 degree angle and noticed a reflective object at what appeared to be an extreme elevation. The object traveled from south west to northeast. On it's path, the object would stop,make a small circle path and then continue on the original path.I first thought the object was a satelite due to it's apperant altitude. I was interested. The object disappared and about 2 minutes later 4 fighter jets flew from the south by NORAD northbound. Thats what made the whole thing seem strange."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.551211,+-105.780087(39129)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39129) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"39129","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-105.780087","Date Submitted":"06/10/2012 03:42 UTC","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-06102012-0020","Object Shape":"Circle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.551211","Date of the Event":"06/09/2012 10:32 UTC","Region":"Colorado"}
