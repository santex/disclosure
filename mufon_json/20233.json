The object had no discernable shape, there were two dim lights on the object and that���s the only visible part of it. The reason I believe this was one object and not two was due to the way in which it moved. The best way I can describe it would be to imagine a pen with a light on each end, and as the object moved though the sky it wobbled from side to side. The object moved at a relatively fast pace to the south until I lost site of it. Now I consider myself a relatively level headed person, I know this wasn���t a satellite, airplane, shooting star or a fireball. I spend a lot of time looking at the stars, and this was something I can say I have never seen before."],"Region":"Illinois","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Unknown object flying over Peoria IL","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Case Number":"20233","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11012009-0003","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON"}
