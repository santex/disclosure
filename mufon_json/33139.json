First sighting of an object like this was a few morning ago traveling the same course. Bright and then faded. Silent. thought it was a satellite. Tonight while walking the dog saw this very bright object, sphere-shaped, brighter than Jupiter. Moving the exact same course as before. Whipped out the flip-cam and filmed it as it crossed the sky. Silent. No navigation lights. Not an airplane and not a satellite. I've observed satellites before with my eyes alone, through binoculars and through my night vision scope. WAY too bright to be a satellite. Not descending. No characteristic flashing of meteor grazing the atmosphere. No sonic boom. Lost sight of the object at the tree-line."],"Case Number":"33139","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.539394","Region":"Georgia","City":"Woodstock","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.10857,+-84.539394(33139)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33139) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/04/2011 07:46 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Summary":"Tonight saw this very bright object, sphere-shaped, brighter than Jupiter.
