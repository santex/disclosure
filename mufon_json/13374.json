{"Case Number":"13374","divs":["sighting detailssomeone called my mother and told her to listen to the scanner because they had heard somone had reported \"mysterious\" lights in the sky. so, my mother turned on the scanner as i went and found my video camera. we didn't think much of it because it was close to the anniversary of 9\\11 but wanted to check it out. so, after listening to the scanner for a few seconds we went ahead and went outside to look for ourselves, and sure enough to the south of our house there was a strange bright light in the sky. it looked at first like a fireball just kinda sitting in the air. then it began to slowly dim until it wasn't really visible anymore. then after a few seconds three seperate lights apearred in the same general area. it continued to stay in a triangle formation that seemed to be pretty exact for about a minute and a half. then after staying in that same shape the lights began to move independently of one another and move across the sky at varied speeds until they were no longer in sight. our part of the encounter accounts for about 5 minutes or so however, the entire encounter from the time it was first seen and called in and then we were able to go outside and view it was probably at least 20 minutes or so."],"Weather Factors":"None, Light","Date Submitted":"09/12/2005 09:00 UTC","Summary":"Heard report of lights over scanner and went outside to see and record three unkown lights.","City":"Robinson","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Log Number":"US-10292008-0035","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/12/2005 09:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.00532","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-87.739194","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Illinois","Object Shape":"Fireball, Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.00532,+-87.739194(13374)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13374) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Robinson","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13374.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13374.html"]}
