An investigation has been initiated. It started by 15th Street (greater Kenosha, Wisconsin) and appeared to follow me to Highway \"E\" and went west with me until I hit Highway 31 and turned north. It took off at that point and headed southeast. It was approximately 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the ground. There were some clouds, but it was well below them. It appeared round until I turned and saw it was more oblong in shape. It gave off more of an off-white color. When I watched it leave in my car's mirror, it left a streak of light like you might see in a Star Trek or Star Wars movie, but made no sound whatsoever as I had opened my window to try and hear something. In a previouis UFO sighting when I was a kid, the UFO did create a sonic boom several times over when it left our area, but nothing this time. (Additional data will be added as the investigation progresses)"],"Longitude":"-87.821185","Latitude":"42.584742","Case Number":"6473","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02282007-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Kenosha","Country":"United States","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"UFO Followed Witness' Car, Turned To Follow When Witness Turned.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
