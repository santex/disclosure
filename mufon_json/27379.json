I looked out my L.R. window & saw a light so I walked downstairs to the walkway & approximately one & a half blocks away to the west I saw the object moving east very slowly. When the object was half a block from me it stopped & cast a bright light on a small field for about 30 seconds. I wasn't afraid but felt uncomfortable. I watched it float silently back to the west until it was out of sight. It struck me as being strange that no one else came out to see what was going on.The object was so low I thought it might hit the power lines.When I first saw it I thought it might have been a helicopter but, there was no rotors & absolutely no noise."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.154504,+-90.04755(27379)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27379) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/13/2011 05:44 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/30/2003 10:30 UTC","Latitude":"35.154504","Tags":"City"}
