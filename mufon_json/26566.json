Stopped on ramp to look at the night sky with all its stars and slow moving planes high up. Above the tall trees across from my deck going from Annapolis area toward Waysons Corner came a UFO flashing across the sky. It's head (?) was large and its trail was very long. It was very very fast. It was not a falling star or space debris as it was horizontal not vertical. This was the first ufo I have ever seen. In my youth I have seen many falling stars and even the aurora borealis in the north (NJ) so I know it wasnt these things. 2. It was very very bright and it was dark out so it startled me. 3. I thought it was a ufo. 4. SEE Main Paragraph. 5. I felt excited, uneasy and anxious to find someone else who had seen it. 6. It went behind tall trees toward the west and was gone."],"Latitude":"38.833142","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/11/2010 06:17 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/14/2010 10:39 UTC"}
