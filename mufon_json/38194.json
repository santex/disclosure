Tried to look at it with binoculars, which were difficult to steady. Object was moving north or northeast, so it became lower on the horizon as I watched. Light was too bright and moved too fast to be a star. If I had to narrow down the description, I'd say I was watching flames from the back of a rocket of some kind - bright white to yellowish white, but red at the trailing end. If it was flames from a rocket, I could not see the rocket itself. Last week's sighting was at about 9 PM and it was farther west; tonight around 10 PM it was farther north. The International Space Station does occasionally pass overhead, but it only stays visible for a few minutes at a time, so this object was not the ISS. Never saw anything in the newspapers last week about such a sighting."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.78277,+-122.415816(38194)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38194) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38194.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38194.html"],"Latitude":"37.78277","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"San Francisco","trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There were 2 other sightings in San Francisco on or around May 16th 2012"],"Summary":"Bright light/object north-northwest from Bay Area skies","Country":"United States","Case Number":"38194","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"California","Longitude":"-122.415816","Log Number":"US-05172012-0003","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile"}
