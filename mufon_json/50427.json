(44 mg) lets see what i can do. pictures coming of what i saw??? i know this is a bit strange but, seeing these objects was amazing and more curious. you know - we hear of ufo's and there's much debate as to they're existence and being a computer guy and engineer - well - i have my doubts about a lot however, this is the first time that i saw something up hand which more than incredible. you might see one i suppose and not knowing what it is - well - it becomes a ufo however - when the whole \"freaking\" family shows up - you have to wonder. there are too many scientists, people of knowledge that have presented evidence but, then again you say - we ain't caught one yet?? to that they say - yes we have. where do you go with it and is there substance. from what i saw - i'm a believer now. i'm going to pass one more thought to you - my last \"encounter\" if you will was monday evening and i tried to get pictures as well. one tuesday morning i was whipped and - i crawled to the bed and made it down quickly (as you know i just got out of the hospital) when i awoke - i couldn't get my bearings - the bed was not under me. i was on my back on the bedroom floor facing the kitchen, the trash bucket turned over. i figured i'd take care of it later and made my way to the bed once again. as i lay, there was dripping coming from my mouth and i knew i must have taken a dive somehow (not recalling) and split my bottom lip but, on what??? getting up latter in which you worried, i checked the floor - no blood. i checked the doors (as if i might have passed out and hit one head on) - nothing. i checked my gums and my mouth but noticed my lips were not lacerated - not cut - and the injury didn't look like a hit to the mouth. rather - it looked like it had been \"burned\" inside my gums. it is healing now but - a point to ponder. exactly what i saw. secondly, (no there are no woman except you). my neighbor came up this morning to ask how i was feeling and if i need anything - give a call. meanwhile she asked if i had chicken?? (that's all she seems to eat) she's having guests and running a bit low. while i was getting her supplies, chicken - asked her if she had seen anything unusual on sunday evening? she said, \"no but had to close her shades\\blinds because the whole area was lit up and she didn't know why\". just annoying.
