It was a bright sunny day without a cloud in the sky and so I wondered why a solid object was just sitting in the sky. I also wondered what was keeping it there. It just stayed in one spot for a long time. When the space shuttle blew up some years back, I had seen it from my car and wondered if that is what I was looking at again. But it was actually much too close to be any kind of space shuttle. I needed to get to an appointment so I didn't stay and look at it for more than 4 minutes. When I looked in my rear view mirror as I was leaving my road, it was still there and then suddenly gone."],"trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There was one other sighting in Austin on or around January 12th 2008"]}
