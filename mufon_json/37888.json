I sensed something that made me look up and to my west. I saw a light orange small circle traveling at a very high rate of speed from what looked to be not to far away. I tracked this orange circle with my eyes until it was pretty much directly above me. It looked as if it went into a low and pretty small cloud but it didn't come out of the other side. It literally made the hair on my arms stand up. I have been studying aviation since childhood, I know my planets, I've witnessed countless shooting stars, etc etc. I have never seen anything like this. When it was nearly overhead it seemed as if it had a light orange glow but it didn't have a glare. It looked to me as if it had a straight line flight path. My gut feeling is that it may have been stationary until I looked up and it traveled into the cloud. I can't explain what made me look precisely into the direction it came from. I have been able to stop thinking about it."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/03/2012 04:07 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Brownstown Charter Township","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.156985,+-83.2651(37888)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37888) map </A>","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.156985","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37888.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37888.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan"}
