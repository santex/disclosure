At first I thought it was a high flying plane given our proximity to LaGuardia airport, but the object was a steady white light with no flashing. Shortly after the sighting I noticed a few airplanes do the contrast confirmed at least that this was different. The bright light moved at a steady pace from west to easy over about 4 minutes, and by that point was over the trees and out of sight. The object made no noise. The object seemed too high to be a hellicopter, and was also silent. At first I thought it was a shooting star (which I remarked on the phonecall) but a slow 4 minute trek over the visible sky seemed a bit off. Perhaps a sattelite of some sort?"],"Summary":"Bright white orb crosses sky with steady movement","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.768186,+-73.735037(38990)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38990) map </A>","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were 43 other sightings in New York on or around June 7th 2012"],"City":"New York","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38990.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38990.html"],"Log Number":"US-06082012-0023","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
