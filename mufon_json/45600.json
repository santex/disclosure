{"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Latitude":"41.76445","Case Number":"45600","Summary":"MANCHESTER CT - glowing streak and glowing ball of light hovering, than dropped","divs":["Sighting DetailsFor the last several weeks I have seen 3 or 4 times seen something, very odd. I am driving down Hartford Road in Manchester, heading toward East Hartford. I look to my left over Route 384, and mid way in the sky I see this golden orange yellow streak across the sky. I think it is a plane, but it isn't. AT the end of the streak is this hovering ball of light. I pull over to watch it, and it is scary because at first you think, OMG is that a falling star,no, is that a comet? No. Is it a medeor? I thought I would hear about a meteor on the news but never did. So after waiting awhile watching this ball of light hover and glow a bright bright orange yellow, it drops. It literally drops , bloop, gone. I would say it was at least 50 miles from where I was on Hartford Road. I saw this several times, and beleive so much now it is a UFO that I am going to go buy a video camera. If anyone else in the area has seen this please let me know. It happens around 3-5 pm around rush hour time."],"Log Number":"US-02062013-0011","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Manchester","There were no other sightings in Manchester on or around February 1st 2013"],"City":"Manchester","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/01/2013 12:00 UTC","Region":"Connecticut","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date Submitted":"02/06/2013 03:35 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.76445,+-72.540402(45600)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45600) map </A>","Longitude":"-72.540402","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45600.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45600.html"]}
