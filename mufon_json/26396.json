At one point all three of us observed a line of 4 reddish-orange lights emerging slowly from behind the trees to the north. I saw what appeared to be a 5th reddish-orange light trailing the other four at a little distance, but when the group of 4 emerged into our line of sight I no longer saw the 5th light. The 4 lights traveled as if they were attached by a string, that is, the distance between them did not vary at all as they moved. Perhaps this indicates that they were attached to a craft of some sort, but none was visible. The lights traveled very slowly, from right to left, across our line of sight in a westward direction. As they moved far to the left they dimmed and flickered out, one by one, until they all disappeared. I tried to take note of whether they passed behind a cloud, and I don���t think that was the case. As far as distance and altitude, I can only say, and my daughter agrees, that they were quite a distance away, maybe one-half to one mile. They were above the tree line, so maybe a thousand feet or so altitude, given the distance. None of us heard any sound from this craft, if that���s what it was, but given the distance from us, that���s impossible to determine. My neighbor dismissed this whole thing, saying they were ���balloons���, but that doesn���t make sense. I���ve been thinking about this and decided it���s definitely out of the ordinary, so decided to report it. My daughter agrees."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"26396"}
