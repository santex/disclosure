{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["sighting detailsi am submitting the attached photographs in the hope that an expert can explain the nature of the object. it is quite possibly an airplane, although it seems to be moving very fast and\\or falling. in addition, the shape seems to be different in each shot. i took the photo(s) during a walk along the coast. the series is of three exposure-bracketed photos (0, -1, +1) taken by holding the shoot button down for the duration of the three shots. i was not aware of the object at the time. if anybody is interested i have the raw files for the images; i'll keep them for a few weeks before discarding them. the photo i have submitted is a jpg (100% quality) with the same resolution as the originals."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.9847,+-0.680823(46650)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46650) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46650.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/46650_submitter_file1__LaZeniafallingobject.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46650.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Torrevieja","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Torrevieja","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"Spain","Date of the Event":"04/04/2013 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/07/2013 06:58 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"ES-04072013-0006","Longitude":"-0.680823","Object Shape":"Unknown","Region":"Valencian Community","Summary":"Unexplained object on a series of bracketed photos.
