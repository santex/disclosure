{"Object Shape":"Disc","divs":["sighting detailshello, last sunday i had a rather strange encounter with a disturbing object in the sky above w���rzburg, germany. i was walking along the railroad lines along the river main to scout new fishing locations. it was already pretty late, it was getting dark, i started to freeze and i wanted to move back towards the city, when i noticed the silence. there was no car, nothing. i stopped and looked around me. although it was a pretty shitty day to be out, nature had a strange beauty in the fading daylight. suddenly i got a strange feeling in my chest, like when i was standing on a vibrating platform, but only very faint. suddenly i felt weak and then i noticed an object in the sky. it was hovering just at the base of the deep hanging clouds and dissappeared every once in a while into the moving clouds maintining its altitude. there was no sound except some light wind, only the strange humming feeling inside my body, maybe like pulsating electricity, i have no idea, i haven't felt like that before. at first, while it was still pretty close, i didn't move at all. i was like in a shock. but while it slowly moved away i realized that what i was seeing might be quite unique and took out my cellphone. i wanted to take a picture but the display wasn't working right. the images had stripes and pressing the trigger didn't do anything. only when the object was already pretty far it worked, i shot the attached picture and then, seconds later, the disk was covered in clouds once more and i never saw it again. here are a few facts: size: can't tell, but i would guess it was pretty big, like 50 meters maybe? the clouds, although deep this day, are still a few hundred meters above ground, so the thing should be bigger than just 10 meters. shape: flat gray disk with lights at the bottom height: just below the clouds\\ in the clouds time: around 6 pm, dawn speed: slowly moving across the sky lights: three white\\blueish and one red, no blinking etc. duration: very hard to tell, it felt much longer than it probably was, maybe 15 seconds for the whole encounter as i work for the local city administration i can not give you my real name, nobody would take me serious anymore here in w���rzburg. i never believed in aliens or ufos, but this thing got me thinking and i actually have no satisfying explanation for it. maybe you guys know more about this thing, especially because it doesn't look like the typical ufo that i have seen on the many silly photos on tv. regards, martin"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Würzburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Felt strange vibration, saw disk hover in the clouds, tried to take cell phone photo but there were interferences, later succeeded.","Country":"Germany","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.791595,+9.953572(15949)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15949) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"49.791595","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15949","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Bayern","Date Submitted":"03/08/2009 12:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/08/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15949.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15949_submitter_file1__IMG0038.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15949.html"],"City":"WÃÂ¼rzburg","Log Number":"DE-03102009-0010","Longitude":"9.953572","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
