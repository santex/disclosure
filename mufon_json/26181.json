( i was headed to a friends house at the time) when i got there i told my friend what i had seen in the sky. when i was telling him about it i was excited, but also nervous. it was just one of the weirdest things that i'd ever seen. i hope to see something like this again someday."],"Summary":"Bright green object hovering in the sky","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Date Submitted":"10/29/2010 12:14 UTC"}
