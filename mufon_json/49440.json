As we were approaching the exit ramp we witnessed a large group of starlight like lights. In the time we ascended the quarter mile exit ramp an additional surplus of lights seemed to appear. There was approx 40. Lights. 7 or so formed a linear line in the middle of the remaining amorphous cloud of lights. We exited the ramp and turned left trying to get a better look.
