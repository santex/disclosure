{"Case Number":"39890","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/28/2012 11:12 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsi was up late studying for school and walked outside to fill the cats water bowl before bed. i looked out into the distance and saw this cylinder like shaped object hovering in the sky. at first i thought it was a planet because of the size being larger than a typical star. however, after further observation i noticed the object began to sway back and forth then stopped and periodically ascended and descended in a fast motion. i have never seen any plane or helicopter move the way this object had. wondering if any one else saw the same thing. i didn't stay up for more than 1 to 1 1\\2 hours after initial sighting to see it disappear. i had continuous sight of the object up until the point when i went to bed around 4:30 or 5:00am. i tried to record the sighting on my phone and it would not pick up on the camera."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39890.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39890.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-82.122845","Log Number":"US-06282012-0013","City":"Evans","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"33.536446","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Evans","There were 11 other sightings in Evans on or around June 28th 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/28/2012 04:59 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.536446,+-82.122845(39890)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39890) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Georgia","Summary":"Shaped like a cylinder emitted blue red white lights with red ring aura hovered with periodic ascending and descending"}
