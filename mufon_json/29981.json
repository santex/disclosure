{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2011 11:33 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsLaying in bed looking out of the skylight last night at 11:33 PM , I saw a roundish red object moving across the night sky from west to east. At first I thought it was a sattelite but it was too big and moving too fast. I pointed it out to my girlfriend and we watched it for a several tens of seconds. Before it went over the horizon, it appeared to take off vertically and I lost sight of it. I looked at a video on this sight from yesterday during fireworks and it looks to be the same object."],"Longitude":"-74.000013","City":"New York","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.723143","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29981.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29981.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"29981","Summary":"Red sphere or oval in sky moving west to east, then vertically out of sight.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.723143,+-74.000013(29981)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29981) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08082011-0012","Date Submitted":"08/08/2011 06:37 UTC","Region":"New York","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were 3 other sightings in New York on or around July 4th 2011"]}
