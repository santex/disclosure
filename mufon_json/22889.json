{"divs":["Sighting DetailsFor the past couple of weeks our family has viewed a diamond shaped object with multi color facets that pulse in the eastern sky at 9:15 pm every night. After looking at it thru binoculars and noticing it wasn't a star we decided to view it thru a spotting scope.It's very bright and seems to have some kind of nucleus that looks like a upside down T.It looks enigeenerd and not a natural object like a meteror.My husband thought maybe it was a satellite in sync with the earth's rotation,but after discussion we feel that it is much bigger than a satellite or the ISS.We are wondering what this could be and would very much like to know!"],"Log Number":"US-04192010-0004","Date of the Event":"04/18/2010 09:15 UTC","Summary":"Seen thru a scope pulsing diamond object with facets with red/blue/green outer edge.","Case Number":"22889","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22889.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22889.html"],"Longitude":"-97.108597","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Flatonia","There were no other sightings in Flatonia on or around April 18th 2010"],"Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","City":"Flatonia","Region":"Texas","Latitude":"29.687732","Date Submitted":"04/19/2010 12:24 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.687732,+-97.108597(22889)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22889) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Diamond"}
