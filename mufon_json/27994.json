(1000 ft?) i went outside on my deck to view it and get a better look. after observing this thru the binoculars for several minutes the red and white lights separated into two distinct larger objects. one red and one white. these two objects flew around each other doing what seemed to be impossible maneuvering at an extremely high rate of speed over a very small area. almost like two huge laser beam points dancing in concert together. the red and white objects were traveling so rapidly in close proximity to each other that they appeared at times as one red and one white streak of light \"dancing\" together creating pretzel like shapes. i could tell that this was not created by me moving the binoculars because the whole time, the orange dot was observed steady and unmoving in the same filed of vision. the orange ball was not making any noticable movement but kept its relationship steady above the slow drifting red\\white display going on below it. after observing this for about 5 minutes all three objects slowly drifted below the horizon behind the tree tops. they either went lower or drifted further away past the horrizon. i continued to look in the direction with my binoculars for about an hour but saw nothing else out of the ordinary. i submitted a report to the nuforc website and to my amazement someone from redding reported seeing a double triangle shaped object with red and white lights fly low over their house on that same day. both reports were not posted on the nuforc website until the following day, so neither one of us could have known about the other until after both were submitted to nuforc. after looking the next day during daylight at the point that this was observed on the horizon and compairing it to a map this puts the event at the following latitude and longitude - 41.264259,-73.39159. on tuesday febuary 22nd at 8pm local time."],"Region":"Connecticut","City":"Danbury","Summary":"Strange light display and manuvers - several hundred feet above tree tops","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"41.403927","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-73.449671","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
