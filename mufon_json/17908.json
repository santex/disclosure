What looked like a satilite come into view coming from the north. As it approached within two finger tips held at arms length it flared from pin prick size to about the size of Venus. Within a few seconds it returned to original size and continued south, disappearing behind a tree. After it was gone we saw another pin prick of light moving behind and in the same direction as the space station but way behind it. This went on for about two more minutes after the initial eventI have been watching the night sky for over 50 years but have never seenanything like this."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Case Number":"17908","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.121244","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17908.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17908.html"],"Summary":"Satellite in area of space station flared from pin prick to size of Venus then when back to pin prick size.","Longitude":"-116.422785","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Yucca Valley","There were no other sightings in Yucca Valley on or around July 6th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"07/06/2009 09:12 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-07072009-0014","Date of the Event":"07/06/2009 09:12 UTC","City":"Yucca Valley","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
