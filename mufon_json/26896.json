{"Country":"United States","Summary":"Luminiscent \" traffic light green \" sphere","Date of the Event":"08/12/1993 04:36 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was a security guard patrolling the Sunrise Lakes (Phase One) residential complex in my patrol car. I noticed, out my left side window, a luminiscent green sphere about 100 feet high, drifting slowly and quietly from North to South. I jumped out of the car, never taking my eyes off of it, to get a better look. It seemed to take notice of my attention and sped up directly to the South on a straight line at an incredible speed, and faded out of sight. The entire incident lasted about 10 or 15 seconds. Coincidently, or not, that day was my first official paranormal investigation of the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, with a partner. Very strange. Also, when I got out of the car to get a better look, I \"felt\" that it noticed me."],"Case Number":"26896","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.161114,+-80.283556(26896)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26896) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"12/08/2010 12:56 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Sunrise","There were no other sightings in Sunrise on or around August 12th 1993"],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26896.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26896.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Sunrise","Longitude":"-80.283556","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"26.161114","Log Number":"US-12082010-0008"}
