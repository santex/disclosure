I assumed a plane had went behind clouds, problem is the object was descending away from us with white lights and I never could actually locate any cloudcover. This was at roughly 10 pm on the 18th of July. Strange object seen the next night also around 10 pm with a north to south path, extremely high altitude with single light bright to dim until it just faded out completely. This night, night of the 21st at approximately 10 pm, bright light appears to the west, quite large and bright. Appeared to be slightly wobbling around while very slowly descending and dimming. Strange note: This was over a lake with a perfect reflection at first and the reflection disappeared even though it was not near tree cover yet, visually it was about one inch above the treeline, no reason to lose reflection. Sometimes the object seemed to consist of three lights once it started to dim with shades of red and a slight blue. All three events were at the same location, different sky locations, all at 10pm, all a bright light which dims and fades away and all completely noise-less.
