I thought it was a balloon but when I sized it up and thought about what I was seeing it looked 4-5 times the size���more like the size of a child���s bouncy ball approximately 50-100 feet in the air. I stopped my car in the middle of the road to observe the object. It hung there in the air. I watched it for about 15 seconds. I had to move my car as traffic came around the corner and forced me to move. I made an immediate U turn in the road and went back. The object was gone. I turn down the next road next to the power lines so I was able to get behind the road where I was to get another view and could not see the object. I did notice a man who was watching me the whole time. He was standing directly below where the object was hovering. I was talking to my wife when I saw the object and told her I had to go because I saw a black sphere. I told her I would call her back because I had to make a U turn because traffic made me move forward. The man who watched me stopped in the road watched me after I U turned and after I can back from behind the road. I wanted to stop and ask him if he saw the object on the 3rd pass but the traffic again forced me on my way. I debated writing in but I can not get this off my mind."],"Longitude":"-76.612388","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
