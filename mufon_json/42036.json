I Watched it for About, One and a Half Minutes. It Suddenly Stopped and Went Directly the Path it Came From. After Another Minute and a Half. It Simply Disappeared. I Was In Utter Amazement, Of What Happened. This Thing Must Have Been Huge. Because I Think the Light I Was Seeing Was a Reflection from the Sun, And It Was Total Darkness at the Time. I Was Very Reluctant to Report It! And Didn't! I Didn't Tell Anybody What Happened."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Erlanger","There were no other sightings in Erlanger on or around June 2nd 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Kentucky","Object Shape":"Disc","Longitude":"-84.640927"}
