{"Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking my dog outside to go to the bathroom in the yard before putting her to bed at 11 pm. I always scan the yard and sky when outside. I noticed a large number of sparkling orange lights in the sky and thought they were fireworks, but they did not fall to the ground as fireworks do. They made no sound. They traveled in a southeasterly direction. I watched them until they disappeared behind the trees. I was very excited and watched them as long as I could see them. They were flying east of the fairgrounds. The lights did not form a pattern and did not act like fireworks."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51680.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51680.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Ohio","Longitude":"-83.069681","Date Submitted":"10/20/2013 06:52 UTC","City":"Delaware","Case Number":"51680","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Delaware","There were no other sightings in Delaware on or around October 19th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"I saw a fleet of orange lights traveling in southeasterly direction over town.
