It was traveling slower then a plane would and relatively low, there wre no clouds but if there were I would say it would have been under cloud cover in height. It looked almost like a mini sun would look as if you would see the sun from space, a ball of fire not like a meteorite but a distinct ball of fire and not moving at an angle but in a straight line. There was no trail like you would see a meteor have it was a orb of fire, I think there might have been a slight smoke trial but I dont remmember exactly that detail isn't clear as it was several months ago."],"City":"Queensbury","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11232012-0003","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Red Orange ball of fire flew south to north in a straight line slowly and lower then a meterorite","Date Submitted":"11/23/2012 08:48 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Queensbury","There were no other sightings in Queensbury on or around August 25th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.375813,+-73.645723(44095)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44095) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
