The red bottom of the craft, which was above and a little north of the football field, was the first thing that caught my eye. I pointed it out to my brother who was driving and we both stared at it for 10 seconds noticing that it was not moving at all and guessing it was about a 1,000 feet in the air. We both looked at his girlfriend in the back to get her attention to check it out and when we looked back it had vanished. Complety gone. We looked all over the sky for it and couldn't find it. What made us think it was a UFO was how quick it disappeared and it's shape and hovering capabilities. Mainly the speed of the disappearance."],"Summary":"Could tell it was metal because the suns reflection was on it making it look like an orange ball. Had a dome top and a flat bottom that looked like it was red.","City":"Merrillville","Log Number":"US-11282010-0010","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26776.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26776.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"11/28/2010 03:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.327714","Date Submitted":"11/28/2010 05:33 UTC","Case Number":"26776","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Merrillville","There were no other sightings in Merrillville on or around November 28th 2010"],"Latitude":"41.489104"}
