{"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsFour or five of us were walking up the side walk between apartment buildings. A twelve year old little girl we were with said \"What is that\" and i looked up at a seventy five degree angel in the sky. They were a long width of stars three in a row on top then three in a row on bottem. the two on the right moved up then came back down in formation as i recall. After that the two on the left went up and came back down in to formation. And the middle repeated. The six moved into a straight line. and then took off in a wavy motion farther out through the stars, at speeds too fast for what normal flights could have done. I imidatly thought it was a UFO. When seeing it it almost made me want to cry."],"Summary":"Six Circular lights did little dance and took off in wavy motion behind stars","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"28279","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.066344,+-117.645648(28279)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28279) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","City":"Ontario","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28279.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28279.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"34.066344","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Ontario","There were no other sightings in Ontario on or around April 27th 1994"],"Date Submitted":"03/18/2011 10:37 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-117.645648","Date of the Event":"04/27/1994 10:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-03182011-0012"}
