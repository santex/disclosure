{"Case Number":"44737","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs i was driving home just after midnight, i noticed a bright light with flashing blue and red lights from a distance. I thought it was an airplane but it looked like it was not moving; this from about 5-7 miles out. I figured the airlpane was flying towards me and that was why it looked like it wasnt moving. As i kept driving closer i noticed that it was just hovering over the freeway. As i was about to drive underneath it, i slowed down, opened the windows and stuck my head out. When i looked up it was a triangle shaped craft with small white lights at each corner of the craft. It was about 75 feet up, motionless and could hear a slight hum. I did not pull over on the highway to take a pic but as i got off the freeway and looked back, it was still hovering over the road. I drove underneath the object at about 12:30am and lost sight after i got off the freeway and onto city streets. At first i was in denial but after i drove directly underneath it, it turned to awe."],"Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44737.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44737.html"],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Walnut Creek","There were no other sightings in Walnut Creek on or around December 22nd 2012"],"Longitude":"-122.061943","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/22/2012 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Latitude":"37.914113","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12232012-0009","City":"Walnut Creek","Summary":"Triangle shaped just hovered over the freeway","Date Submitted":"12/23/2012 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.914113,+-122.061943(44737)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44737) map </A>"}
