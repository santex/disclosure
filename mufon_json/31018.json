As we came over a hill, we spotted six or seven orange lights in the sky ahead of us in what appeared to be a zig-zag pattern. It should be noted that this zig-zag pattern was laid out vertically and not horizontally from our point of view. At first I thought they were streetlights, but it quickly became clear that they were not attatched to anything, nor were they attatched to each other. I cannot be sure of whether they were stationary or in motion. We drove underneath them, and as we did, I stuck my head through the window for a better look. It was clear that the objects were not stars. If they were in motion, they were headed south toward Kent, but this may only have been an illusion caused by the northbound motion of our car. Unfortunately we were unable to take a picture or video of the objects, nor were we able to find a place to pull over and get a better look. We continued driving north and soon lost sight of them."],"Date of the Event":"08/11/2011 09:45 UTC","City":"Streetsboro","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Ohio","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31018.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere"}
