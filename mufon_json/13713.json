I was Northbound and the object was low, and to the East. It may have been circular, but what I saw was a half-circle of lights and the object was tipped at an angle. Was moving but slowly heading south. I was stunned. Tried to see if other cars were slowing down to look, but my group was travelling too fast to be breaking. I didn't see any tail lights ahead of me, but the freeway was pretty crowded. Someone else had to have seen it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13713.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13713.html"],"Longitude":"-122.598718","Case Number":"13713","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Half circle of white string of lights with one blue, one red.","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/13/2008 09:14 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"45.366143","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.366143,+-122.598718(13713)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13713) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other"}
