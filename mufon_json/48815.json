Even though the ships seem to be red and they were flashing, in reality their light was very bright and stable. At first these ships were standing. Then, they started to move slowly in groups of 3 to 4 or maybe more while the others remained in place. They didn't make any sound. I saw clearly one of the ship which went above my building (i don't know exactly at what distance was the ship, but it was enough to see clearly the ship's shape). It was ovoid and had a light color."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Egg, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48815.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48815.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/30/2013 12:00 UTC","Summary":"I was sleeping.
