{"divs":["Sighting DetailsSaw single bright orange light in sky,wavering flight path no sound and then disappearing, not like aircraft taking off or landing from PDX which we see daily. Orange light appeared one at a time, first one came and went then second appeared and went. no passenger planes were taking off or landing at the time. Right after orange Orbs were seen there was a searchlight in the sky around the area of the airport where from our perspective was from the airport. The constant orange light never changed color or flashed signaling an airplane or helicopter. Both lights disappeared over the western sky from our perspective would be downtown Portland."],"Tags":"City","Region":"Oregon","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"01/01/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.466882","Longitude":"-122.581543","Date Submitted":"01/01/2013 04:17 UTC","Log Number":"US-01012013-0015","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"44889","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were no other sightings in Portland on or around January 1st 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44889.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44889.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Portland","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.466882,+-122.581543(44889)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44889) map </A>","Summary":"Orange lights over what is Portland International Airport,both vanished after 30 sec","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
