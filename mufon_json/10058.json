The disc decended from a cloud deck at about 8K just beyond a mountain near what is known locally as Johnson Lane. It performed a series of tight right hand turns just inside the bottom of the cloud deck and then exited straight up thru the deck and disappeared. Distance from my observation point to the disc is estimated at 1.5 miles to 3 miles. The turns were noted as high speed and almost right angle turns which would be impossible for conventional aircraft. No noise was detected during the observation of piston or jet aircraft."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
