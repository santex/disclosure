It was silent, slow and quite low, approximately 4 stories off the ground ��� making its shape and color extremely clear. It was traveling from the southwest to the northeast. The sighting lasted 3-5 seconds before it passed out of view. I emailed a local television station within 15 minutes of the sighting asking if anyone else had seen a possible UFO in the area and later called the Denver, Colorado FAA office as I had not received an email back from the television station. The FAA called back, asked me a number of questions, including my exact location and then asked me to forward a copy of my email to the television station. I was told they would call me back if they uncovered any information. Since, I have contacted a number of UFO Sighting online sites, every radio and television station in the Denver metro area. This was an awe inspiring sight, a sense of calm and serenity enveloped me during the sighting and a memory I hope never to forget!"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Summary":"Very low, very large, silent, slow moving, Seemless almost glowing grey bottomed, Trianglular UFO sighted with 6 while lights - 1 each tip - 1 midline each side","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-104.965146","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.548444,+-104.965146(14562)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14562) map </A>","Case Number":"14562"}
