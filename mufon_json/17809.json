Then, hours later, at apx. 4:20am the same night (July 5th), I stepped outside in the back yard to let the dog out. While I waited, I gazed up into the northern sky. I immediately spotted a moving white object coming from the west and traveling east. It was not directly overhead, but apx. 80 degrees up from horizon. Initially, I thought it was an airplane at cruising altitude, and what I was seeing was its \"headlight\". But when it passed the \"approach\" threshold from my vantage point and was moving away, I did not see the usual strobe lights of an airplane. Just the same steady white light. As it faded into the distance, I thought I saw it take on a slightly pinkish-white hue. Hard to tell since by this time, it was barely visible."],"Longitude":"-83.018377","Log Number":"US-07052009-0014","Latitude":"42.50101","Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"17809","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17809.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17809.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
