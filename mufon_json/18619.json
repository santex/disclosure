I saw what I thought was a satellite moving from north to south across the sky at about the same speed as a normal satellite. I focused my attention on the object but sd I watched the \"satellite,\" it suddenly flashed bright enough to cause shadows on the ground, and took off in a totally new direction at an incredible rate across the sky before disappearing completely. The only reason I bothered to report this event was that I saw that someone else relatively near my location also reported a sighting that matches mine exactly."],"Longitude":"-93.089072","Log Number":"US-08122009-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.882312,+-93.089072(18619)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18619) map </A>","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18619.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18619.html"]}
