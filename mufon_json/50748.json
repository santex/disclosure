Both different shapes.","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50748.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50748.html"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was awake early and stood on my balcony to watch the sunrise and noticed 2 shining objects which I thought may be satelites and so I took a picture of both before the sun came over the horizon. When the sub rose over the horizon, it was not possible to see either one. When I look at one photo, the object looks possibly saucer shaped and the other is difficult to decipher. Perhaps with a better viewer enhancer there will be a better shape. One last picture (4) is just before the sunrise."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Andalusia","Latitude":"36.544148","Log Number":"ES-09112013-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.544148,+-4.624944(50748)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50748) map </A>","Longitude":"-4.624944","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","City":"Fuengirola","Country":"Spain","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"50748","Date Submitted":"09/11/2013 01:41 UTC","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fuengirola","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
