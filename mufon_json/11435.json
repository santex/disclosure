The sound was unusualy loud like they were just above the building. They seemed to go by one at a time. I did not think anything about it considering it was Fourth of July. The next day as I was reading the news paper, (Worcesters' Telegram and gasette)Sat.7-5-08. People reported the noise to police from Worcester, Auburn and Leicester. Local airport did not recieve any info on military flights and nothing on radar. Though the noise was unnerving and frightened some people, it only lasted about ten minutes.
