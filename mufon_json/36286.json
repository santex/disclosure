{"divs":["Sighting DetailsApprox 10:35 pm on Sat. March 3rd, 2012 I was driving down Cam. Vera Cruz in San Clemente. Something caught my attention in the sky, northeast of where I was. 3 glowing, orange & red fireball type objects were in the sky, hovering over the hillside. One object was larger than the other 2 and appeared to be approx the size of a basketball, though I don't know how far away it actually was from me. The other 2 were smaller, appearing to be the size of softballs, maybe larger. I stopped in the middle of the street to take pictures and watch them more carefully to make sure they weren't planes or helicopters (though they appeared to be way too low to be aircraft). One of the smaller ones then faded & dissapeared. I continued driving, while watching them. My view was blocked temporarily by some trees and when my view was clear again, only the larger object remained. I had driven to pick up my son from a friends house and when he came out, he saw it too, though it appeared to have moved higher in the sky. This all occured over approx a 10 minute period. As we drove out of the neighborhood, the trees once again blocked our view and when our view was once again clear, the object was gone. I was fascinated and curious about what they were, but wasn't scared. The photos I took with my cell phone aren't great quality, but when you zoom in you can see glowing yellow-orange balls of light."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.786201","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.786201,+-119.415192(36286)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36286) map </A>","Summary":"Witnessed 3 glowing balls of light, one larger than the other two.
