When we were close to her apartment by the preschool I felt like somebody was watching me. So I looked up, and I saw right above my head about 20 yards high a round 6 foot in diameter object. As soon as I saw it it disappeared into space at a high speed. It was very beautiful having colors of orange, pink, blue and violet. Later I found out my lady friend saw it long before I did, but did not say anything. Thank you."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Garden Grove","There were no other sightings in Garden Grove on or around November 30th 1995"],"Date Submitted":"11/30/1995 05:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9769.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9769.html"]}
