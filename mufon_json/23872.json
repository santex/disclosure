Close to Newton...I think east of town and she thinks west of town.....she noticed first something shiney up in the air. As I was looking for it, it came over the front of the car and then down the side of the hill. It was the size of about 12\" shiny and swirling ball. We have no idea what it was or if anyone on the road saw it. There was a lot of traffic as this was the Saturday before the Iowa Corn 250 in Newton. What I saw was a shiny sphere about 12\" round just turning and turning like the earth does.
