She was on her way to work and saw the object hovering over Route 50 above the Ross County Correctional Institution. The object was long and cylindrical and was whitish silver in color. She couldn't tell if there was any rotation to the object, but could tell that the object appeared to look the same from all angles. She had to go to work, so she stopped watching the object.
