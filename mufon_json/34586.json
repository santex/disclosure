We saw a silent triangle shaped flying object .","Date Submitted":"01/04/2012 05:02 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt about 2:30 AM while watching the sky in my backyard; waiting for the meteor shower to begin my wife and I witnessed a triangle shaped object fly overhead from north to south. It was flying very low and was silent. It did not have lights. There was 3 white, round shapes at each point of the triangle. It moved extremely fast. When we first saw it coming toward us we thought it may have been a meteor, or maybe a flock of birds until it was directly over our heads. The object flew in a straight line. When we realized it was not birds or a meteor we were stunned. It left us scratching our heads as to what we had just witnessed. We lost sight of the object as it flew south past the tall trees."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/04/2012 02:45 UTC"}
