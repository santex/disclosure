Outside temperature estimated at 60 degrees. I exited my vehicle noticing a standout magnitude star at approximately 21:13 hours. Suddenly, an object moving from the south or over my right shoulder came into my field of vision moving across my left shoulder. The vehicle was moving at a substantial velocity unlike regular air traffic over San Luis Obispo. Additionally, orange and white lights tipped this unusually shaped craft and did not strobe - it was triangular in shape flying at an estimated altitude between 3,000 and 5,000 feet moving south to north across downtown. Furthermore, this craft was silent and flying toward the weather system moving in from the north. Unidentified flying event duration was approximately 4 minutes in length. I did not capture the craft on film or video instead drawing my best approximation of the vehicle. Please note that San Luis Obispo is an estimated 55 miles from Vandenberg Air Force Base.
