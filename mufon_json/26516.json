{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was just out side closing the back garage door and happened to be star watching, like I do a lot then I happened to see it. It was a white dot mixed with the stars but larger. Then turned blue and continued moving at a real slow speed from east to west. I have a couple still frams and about a minute of video recording. I have the ( Google ) star program and it was not a star on the chart."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.338145,+-93.74289(26516)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26516) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11112010-0015","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26516.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26516_submitter_file1__IMAG0089.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26516.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/11/2010 11:51 UTC","Case Number":"26516","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Sphere, Other","Longitude":"-93.74289","Region":"Minnesota","Date of the Event":"11/08/2010 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Big Lake","There were no other sightings in Big Lake on or around November 8th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"45.338145","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"white circle then blue circle real slow moving no sound","City":"Big Lake"}
