We were actually in the Morgan Mill area when we saw what looked like a hovering object through the trees. It was probably a good 2 miles away as the crow flies. At first we thought maybe it was a helicopter, because at one point it turned, and it was very thin looking at it head on. I have seen helicopters before, but after observing it for awhile, my husband, my mother, and I decided we all saw the same thing. It hovered for quite awhile, then at one point it seemed like it was headed our direction. We were all so taken aback that we pulled off of the county road to watch it for a little bit. After watching it for about 15 minutes we lost sight of it in the hills. It did not move back and forth it stayed completely stationary except for when it turned sideways."]}
