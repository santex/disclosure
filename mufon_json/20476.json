It was moving fast in a zig zag motion in the sky by the Big Dipper. I watched it for about 20 seconds and then it was gone. I thought at first that it was a sattilite, but they move in a straight line and this made two 90 deg. turns. I ran inside to tell my husband but it was gone by then."],"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Newport","Case Number":"20476","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oregon","Latitude":"44.638284","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"11/11/2009 09:22 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20476.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20476.html"],"Log Number":"US-11112009-0024","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
