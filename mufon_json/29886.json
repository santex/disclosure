We parked the Jeep pointing east (equipped with compass).Then we took the camp chairs out so we could sit and be comfortable . We started using binoculars to scan the sky ,me north and my husband was looking south. After a few minutes clouds were forming so we decided to change direction to see more stars. Me to the west and my husband east. I was looking at Mount Jefferson when i seen this light coming towards us at a slow speed .I told my husband and he said it maybe a plane. The object had no navigation lights blinking though ,solid white sphere. As it came closer the light stayed the same brightness and it changed elevation as it got closer (my husband said about 1000 feet or so).The strange part is the object changed shape to a rectangle. Then it turned to the south now at even lower elevation it went over at tree top level with no sound. (distance from us 2 miles).Lost sight after going over the trees.We felt no fear just excited .Another thing that happened was all sounds stopped when it came closer frogs , crikets, cows . Then when it was gone they started back up.We left about an hour after this happened ."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Culver","There were no other sightings in Culver on or around July 1st 2011"],"Date of the Event":"07/01/2011 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29886.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29886.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"44.533025","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
