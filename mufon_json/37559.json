I was facing south and noticed the light. I thought it was an airplane at first. It seemed to approach very quickly. as it got closer I noticed only one flashing white light on it. I heard no sound from any jet engine. It was close enough to be able to hear it and it was a relatively quiet evening. Ambient noise from the freeway a half mile away. Not enough sound to drown out noise from a jet aircraft. I looked closer and noticed it did not have the flashing red and green FAA lights as are required on commercial and military aircraft. in under a minute it had passed over the hills just north of me. Judging by it's speed, I concluded that whatever it was, was not propeller driven. in the approx 45 seconds I had witnessed it, It had covered a distance of 15 miles. that gives the object an estimated speed of 1200 MPH."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.165953,+-119.760156(37559)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37559) map </A>","Summary":"Bright light with single flashing white light.
