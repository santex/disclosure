We werewatching CNN News War on Iraq. We were just chatting about the war and lookingout at the lake when I noticed red lights hovering above the neighbors house 2doors down. I looked at my partner and said do you see that He says ya I seethat. Wow. Our friend was talking to us and he turned around to try to seewhat we were talking about. The door was open and I jumped up and ran out toget a better look. By the time we got to the door it was gone. No noise nonothing. Gone. Their living room is all windows so there is no way I couldhave missed it. Our friend did not see it and I know it was not a car orsomething passing by. It was dark out but there was like 5 red lights tracingaround the craft and it had one red light on the top. I feel like they werewatching us in the house. And when I got up to run to the door they took off."],"Summary":"hovering disk above lake","Latitude":"38.198644","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Dome, Other","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Lake Ozark","There were no other sightings in Lake Ozark on or around March 28th 2003"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.198644,+-92.638797(2203)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2203) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Log Number":"","Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"2203","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Date of the Event":"03/28/2003 09:40 UTC","City":"Lake Ozark"}
