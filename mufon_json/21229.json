I was dropping a friend off from fishing one summer night about 8:30pm, when I started to pull away my friend starts yelling at me to look up, he's jumping up and down, up and down! I jump out saying, what's the problem!! He's saying LOOK!! LOOK!! It was a UFO! It was a cigar shape object that was pretty dame long. I'm guessing it was at a altitude of about 5000 feet, it could of been higher but I'm gonna say 5000 ft! the freaky thing about this was, you couldn't see both ends of this UFO at one time that's how long it was, It did have a purple hue to it with no noise that I could hear but then again it was pretty high up. The speed of this thing was slow but eventually it faded away and then it was gone.. After it was all over with all I could do was stand there with a dumbfounded look on my face, starring, same thing with friend!"],"City":"Belleville","Latitude":"40.794844","Date of the Event":"05/31/1988 08:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"-74.146007","Object Features":"Unknown"}
