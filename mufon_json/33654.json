{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Wisconsin","City":"Waterford North","divs":["Sighting DetailsHusband and I driving south on 83 at about 12:15 a.m. We both saw a very shiny long cylinder shaped object flying south. I was very reflective almost radiating, or reflecting white light. We watched it move fast and then slow like it was banking or turning. There was not a cloud to be seen in the sky. We both stared at it then it faded and disappeared. Within 1 minute a low flying jet flew right into the same path the object was in and kept heading south. This plane had jet fume trail behind it so we assumed it was a jet, it was flying very low like the object. We would like to know if anyone else saw this."],"Object Shape":"Cylinder","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33654.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33654.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.805631,+-88.216593(33654)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33654) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/27/2011 11:42 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.805631","Case Number":"33654","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Very shiny cylinder object seen in am then faded away, in clear skies, followed by low flying jet heading in same direction.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Waterford North","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11272011-0025","Date of the Event":"11/26/2011 12:15 UTC","Longitude":"-88.216593"}
