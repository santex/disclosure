I was contacted, through the blog, by a witness with the request to help him with translating and submitting the report. The following is the translation of his first email to me: Hello. My name is P.S., 41 y.o. from Tryavna, Bulgaria. On 1 October, 2008, at 2:00AM something woke me up and I decided to look through the window. I opened slightly the curtain and was shocked. Against the window, in the sky, I saw six orange colored UFO-s arranged in a triangular formation. Each of the objects was with the size of a full moon, a little smaller. The objects were moving from east to the west. I looked at them till they arrived above the house. Then I quickly left the house and went out, in the yard. There happened something incredible. The whole triangle turned sharply to the left. The six objects began to exchange their positions till they rearranged themselves again in a triangular formation and continued moving to the sought-west. I am interested in astronomy and astronomic observations since I was a pupil and I know that this couldn���t be a natural phenomenon. I know only that this could be operated only by intelligent beings. I believe in extraterrestrial life. Since October, I make regular night observations and I believe that I���ll see them again. Unfortunately, I am alone in Tryavna and have no one here to share my views and experience. The following is some additional information I received from P.S. in other e-mails: The next day, on 1 October, I went to the police station and reported my sighting. I asked whether they had received other signals about this. They just looked at me and shrugged. Probably they thought that I���m crazy, but they were three policemen there. After the police, I went to the editorial office of the local newspaper ���Tryavna Week���. They also didn���t have any information but looked interested in publishing my story in the newspaper. I refused because I���m a public figure and I was afraid they may think that I am crazy, on drugs, or drunk. You asked did I make any photos. It was 2:00 AM; I was dumbfounded and even didn���t think to take my cell phone to make pictures. All this happened very quickly, in 1-1.5 minutes. The objects were moving quite fast, but I was able to examine them well enough. There were no sounds. It was dark and quiet. The objects were moving smoothly and didn���t make any noise. While they were making the maneuver, I was paralyzed with fear because I didn���t expect it. When I saw the objects above the house, they looked perfect circles. When they moved away, to the west, they looked more like baseballs. After I entered back in the house, I didn���t look at the clock because I didn���t turn on the lights. I briefly looked at the clock on my cell phone only when I woke up and before looking through the window. Back in the house, after the sighting, I laid down but couldn���t sleep at all. 10 minutes later I gathered some courage and went out again. And this continued all night, walking in and out of the house. Do I think that they ���saw��� me? Yes, definitely. Now I have this strange feeling like they are looking at me all the time. A few days later, I was searching the web and found on some American website a picture that looked exactly like what I saw. Only that one was made of 10 objects. Mine were 6. I was completely delighted to find out that other people have seen the same thing I saw. Should you be interested in receiving more information from P.S. or from me, please, contact us at the provided e-mails. Three days ago I tried to contact the Bulgarian MUFON chapter with no success. The attached are 2 drawings of the triangular formation made by P.S. daughter under his supervision. The photo shows his house on the left and was made later, from the spot, where he was looking at the objects. The direction is sough-sought-east and is the place, where the objects rearanged their positions."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"Bulgaria","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/01/2008 02:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.867317,+25.492718(15075)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15075) map </A>","Region":"Gabrovo","Case Number":"15075","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Tryavna Municipality","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/01/2008 02:00 UTC"}
