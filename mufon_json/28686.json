I noticed an object in the sky that was traveling south paralel to the coast. I remarked to my wife that there was an airliner flying by. As I continued to observe it I realised that there was no contrail in spite of my estimate of fifteen miles and about thirty thousand feet. That made me watch it more closely whereupon I realised that it was not the typical cigar shape of an airliner. Indeed, it was a sphere. It shined in the clear blue sky as polished aluminum with the sun at a not severe angle forelighting it. Then, it stopped appearing.
