I saw a light that looked exactly like a shooting star except it was going straight down like a streak but it looped or curved to the left then down, in the far distance, disappeared in seconds, was not a flare or lantern, I think it was a meteor, but it didnt fall in an arc. I turned off the radio and exclaimed\" A Shooting star! No a meteor! I dont know!\" This was at 6:50 in the evening and looked like a shooting star but heading straight down and looping to the left before disappearing in the distance. It was very fast but shooting stars dont go down."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"11/02/2013 10:34 UTC","Log Number":"US-11022013-0017","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"{kt}Very bright light shooting down looped or spiraled along the way","Date of the Event":"11/02/2013 06:50 UTC","Region":"Washington","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
