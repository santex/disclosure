The airplane traffic patterns here in central florida run north and south. Any object we see crossing East West we watch carefully. the event lasted about 5 minutes give or take 30 seconds. As the object moved it went in spurts and headed due north and then back to East several time. Mighty sloppy flying for a plane. The object was an intense blue white, no flashing or different colors same size as average star but much brighter. As far as altitude goes there were several planes in the near vicinity it appeared to be higher than the planes were. We watched until it disappeared into the clouds and we could not find it again."]}
