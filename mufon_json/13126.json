I was the only observer. One month ago I saw a huge disk at about the same location doing a laser flash and disappearing. The day after this second event, Military and other helicopters were scouring that same patch of sky for hours. How do I feel about it? I am still recovering from the first sighting and just hope I am not being singled out for something. My job puts me in the right places and times for these sightings so I am thinking it must be that. I have been having some street lamp interference events lately so I have been looking up a lot."],"Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"semi circular lazer flash","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Live Oak","There were no other sightings in Live Oak on or around October 19th 2008"],"Log Number":"US-10202008-0016","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
