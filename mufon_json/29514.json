{"Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"29514","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details At home,central NY, clear to partly cloudy sky, cool dry air, 65f. Looked out garage window, south, saw bight white cylinder shape, traveling from west to east. At first I thought it was airline traffic, went out for a better look, but no wings,strobes, or sound. It seemed to shift slightly to the south and gradually gain altitude, I lost it in the predusk sky not on the horizon. After it past it was a bright white dot, It faded as a point of white light. Not a very spectacular sighting just wondering if anyone else saw it."],"Latitude":"42.596181","Date of the Event":"06/12/2011 08:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/12/2011 09:34 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29514.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29514.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.596181,+-76.09326(29514)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29514) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-06122011-0015","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in McGraw","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:25","Object Features":"None","Summary":"bright white cylinder","Region":"New York","City":"McGraw","Longitude":"-76.09326"}
