But when I looked at them I knew they were not strange, because I alreday saw things like that 2 times near my house on the sky, but a few months ago before I sighted this one, and the anothers lights I had sighted on the sky, had 1 ball runnig around the UFO (that I could see), similar this photo, but in this one if you put zoom, you can see 2 black balls around the UFO, anyway, the balls I had saw similar this photo, didnt stay freezed like a rock, they keep moving, running all around the central light but not too fast and not too slow, regular speed, like a magnetic polos, I dont know.. But on this time unfortunately I have just saw the photo, thats it, and sorry for my bad inglish."],"Log Number":"CL-09232009-0001","Latitude":"-33.045646","Date of the Event":"08/02/2009 02:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19592.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19592_submitter_file1__P8010733.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19592.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"19592","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-71.620361","Country":"Chile","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-33.045646,+-71.620361(19592)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19592) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/23/2009 12:02 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Valparaiso"}
