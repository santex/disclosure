It just seemed to sit there.. Then very eraticaly it made a number of very fast, and very precise maneuvers. It went up, down, left, right, horizontal etc.. but always seemed to be in a for lack of a better word, a box I suppose, in other words it allways stayed within this physical space. I watched this for probably 20-30 minutes, and it finally shot off almost instantly upwards..I realize that area 51 is right there, and it was certainly in that vacinity. That said, i dont know if it was \"Alien\" or if it is a VERY advanced air craft that the US has designed, and built.. either way, I have never again seen anything in the sky behave in that manner.. It was truly awe inspiring."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.115816,+-115.171296(17511)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17511) map </A>","Longitude":"-115.171296","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17511.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17511.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"08/15/1992 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Erratic flying, up, down, left right, very fast, very precise.","Log Number":"US-06162009-0001","Date of the Event":"08/15/1992 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Nevada","City":"Las Vegas","Case Number":"17511"}
