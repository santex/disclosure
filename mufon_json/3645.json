I must have watched Duel (1971 with Dennis Weaver and Directed By Steven Spielberg) at least 20-30 times. Today, 7-31-05, I just noticed what may be a rod at about the 1 hour mark. I saw it on an older VHS and a new DVD I just bought today. On the video it is at about the 1 hour 3 minute and 30 second mark and on the DVD it is at the 1 hour 2 minute and 47 second mark (aprox times). Dennis Weaver is sleeping next to railroad tracks and he is awakened by the train. He then begins driving. As he is driving down the road the camera appears to be on a hillside. Out of the lower right hand corner of the screen the \"Rod\" shoots to the left, appears to complete a couple of 360 degree turns and shoots off the bottom of the screen. I don't really have a clue as to what it is but if anyone has any thoughts I would love to hear them. You will probably have to slow down the DVD or tape to see it for the first time. I'll send a copy of this to rense.com which is where I found your sight. Thanks!"],"Case Number":"3645","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3645.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08012005-0001"}
