Both are visible to the trained, unaided eye. The transport craft are similar to our aircraft carriers in the respect that they both discharge smaller craft and, later, provide a landing site. I've identified 8 transport craft that discharge hundreds of scout vehicles nightly. Watching this is both awesome and frightening, knowing the vast numbers but unaware of their intentions. I have an enormous amount of information that I will share with you and others on this site. Thank you for submitting information about the watchers and blinkers."],"Case Number":"28357","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.244775,+-75.277086(28357)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28357) map </A>","City":"Lansdale","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/22/2011 06:50 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-75.277086","Log Number":"US-03222011-0009","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lansdale","There were no other sightings in Lansdale on or around March 22nd 2011"],"Date of the Event":"03/22/2011 10:30 UTC"}
