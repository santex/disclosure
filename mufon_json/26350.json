{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI wish I had not waited months to reports this, but until recently did not know who to report it to. I saw a television program that described your field researchers and I liked that your set scientific and observational standards. I do not like wild speculation and absurd conjectures as I often see in deranged programs like UFO Hunters or whatever it is called. I like mysteries to be approached rationally. This brings me back to the night of August 11, 2010. I have long wondered if anyone else had reported anything for that night. Soon after the event, I posted an oblique statement on my Facebook page ���Did anyone else see that?��� simply so I would not forget the date and time. I do not jump to conclusions, but I have also failed to find a prosaic explanation for the event. There were two other people with me who saw the strange object. I will leave their names off of here for the time being. [They live nearby, but I have not asked their permission to include them in this report.] We were standing in my driveway just after full dark. It was likely between 8 and 9pm. Checking the time for full darkness at the time of the year should some up with a very close approximate time. There was a bright moon shinning in the in the southeast quadrant of the sky. I think if it were not for that, we would have seen nothing. I was facing north toward my companions as we stood there talking. The evening was pleasant and it had grown dark. It was not unusual for us to stand outside and talk although we were about to say goodnight. One of my companions was looking behind me and saw it first. She made a gasping noise or other sound while looking into the sky behind me. I turned to see what she was looking at. We live about 20 miles from Philadelphia International Airport in the town of Richwood, NJ and frequently have large numbers of commercial airliners circling overhead. I expected something of this sort. What I saw was very different. I turned to look south and saw it almost immediately or at least the impression of it. I also said a rather surprising swear word which I would not normally use in this company. The object was moving quickly in a east-north-east direction [toward the Delaware River and Chester, PA] and at first it was just a suggestion of movement because it was black against black. It was simply a different shape of black flying with no lights at all. The moonlight caught on the shape and revealed it as the sharp-angled boomerang without further detail to the surface. It annoys me to report it as an angular boomerang shape because I know there have been many other reports like that. It was very large in the sky. Much larger than the commercial airliners we see daily on their approach to Philadelphia. I do not know what altitude the circling airliners are at this point in their approach, but that is probably not too difficult to find out. Their windows are easily visible. This was far larger than those. There were no airplanes in sight at the time of the event. The trouble is that for it to be that size it would have to have been either unusually low and close to us or farther away and unbelievably vast in size. The object cruised quickly by without the slightest sound or change in speed or altitude. I hoped it would pass in front of the moon, but unfortunately it moved ���beneath��� where the moon was and was quickly lost to view in the dark. It was moving fast but without knowing the distance I would not guess at its speed. It was gone before there was much chance of further reaction. I turned to my companions and we were all equally dumbfounded. There was nothing more to do except head inside. I typed the note on Facebook so I would not forget, but I also had hoped someone else might say something. It was a long shot. No one else reported anything. I have seen stealth bombers flying in the desert and they are huge. This object was at LEAST that large, but I felt it was larger still. The stealth was my best suspect as I racked my brain, but it does not make sense. For a stealth to be that large, it would have to be too close. Why would a bomber be flying so low in a densely populated area? A stealth can easily fly above local air traffic. Flying without lights would be extremely dangerous around this crowded airspace even if you were training the crew in radar evasion. That part is speculation as I do not know if they even do this sort of live training. We saw no evidence of exhaust, but I believe a stealth does mask that. If it was that close, we should have heard it. I doubt that even a stealth can be that silent. I have not been able to think of an easy explanation for the object."],"Date of the Event":"08/11/2010 12:00 UTC","City":"Harrison","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26350.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26350.html"],"Log Number":"US-11042010-0005","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Harrison","There were no other sightings in Harrison on or around August 11th 2010"],"Summary":"A VERY large, Boomerang-shaped object tracked across the sky in a NE direction just after full dark.","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Region":"New Jersey","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Longitude":"-75.165457","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.722614,+-75.165457(26350)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26350) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/04/2010 10:31 UTC","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"26350","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"39.722614","Country":"United States"}
