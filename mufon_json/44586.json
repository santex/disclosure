I looked up to look at the stars. I was looking at the stars that are shaped like an \"M\" at the lowest point there was an extra star. The light then moved straight down then turned and moved slowly to the north east. It moved slowly for a few seconds then shot off at high speeds then vanished. This is the same thing that happened on 3 occasions. On the 20th there was a passenger airliner flying from north to south in the sky that I seen the object was behind the airplane the 27th and 4th there was none. I have not seen the object since. I ruled out meteor because of the slight of the object moving down and then accelerating. And the timing was exact to the minute when I went out for a break. The objects colors 1st and second time where bright white. The 3rd times was tan. My feeling was \"? What did I just see I was in disbelief? I lost sight of the object because it flew very fast to the northeast and disappeared before the horizon."],"Log Number":"JP-12152012-0020","City":"Hitachinaka","Country":"Japan"}
