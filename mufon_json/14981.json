{"Country":"United States","City":"Kansas City","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving from 40th and Locust to 44th and Pennsylvania (approx 5 minutes), and the whole drive there were 6 glowing fireballs moving slowly through the sky. I didn't first notice them until I came to a stop sign, and just saw them in the sky. I don't recall what I first thought they were... ufo came to my mind rather instantaneously, though. They moved together in a formation of 2 interlocking triangles, but I could tell they were independent of each other. Not all together rigid formation, but not all together loose movement, either. They were high in the sky, traveling in a general eastward direction. Along the way, I saw people getting out of their cars to look at them, some taking photos. It was somehow an amazing feeling...I knew something big was happening. After I reached my destination, I got out of the car, and they (after about 30sec) disappeared into the horizon."],"Date Submitted":"01/17/2009 10:10 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"6 glowing fireballs moving in 2 triangles over Westport, Kansas City 1-17-09 10pm.","Longitude":"-94.573897","Log Number":"US-01182009-0010","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14981.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14981.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/17/2009 10:10 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"14981","Tags":"City","Region":"Missouri","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 2 other sightings in Kansas City on or around January 17th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.106696,+-94.573897(14981)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14981) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"39.106696"}
