This time caught a yellow mass in the left area of telephone wires near 9:00 o'clock position of sun's corona. Taken at 5:28 PST all three sequential pix from a run. There were 5 in sequence. Took the three that had mass plus void , plus mass again in sequential order. I didn't think these were caused by sun flare. Perhaps a filter can enhance this anomaly. Reporting all unknowns? G.A. from Whittier.
