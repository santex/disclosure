{"Date Submitted":"08/12/2007 09:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the evening of 12 Aug 2007 I witnessed, along with my wife, a very bright, brilliant light traveling across the early evening sky. It was heading east, moving slowly. It made no sound that we could hear, never changed directions, and maintained the same speed throughout the sighting. We watched this event for approximately 30-40 seconds. The light faded away with distance. I thought it may be part of the meteor shower that we were planning on watching. However, it looked nothing like a shooting star. I am now convinced that it was not part of the nights meteor shower. I've been in the Navy for 9+ years and am currently stationed at NASWI in Oak Harbor, Washington. I work as a mechanic on Naval aircraft. I have seen many types of aircraft in flight throughout the years. This was like nothing I've ever seen."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Very Bright Star-like Light Traveling in Sky","Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08152007-0009","Date of the Event":"08/12/2007 09:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"48.293156","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.293156,+-122.643224(7686)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7686) map </A>","Longitude":"-122.643224","City":"Oak Harbor","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Oak Harbor","There were no other sightings in Oak Harbor on or around August 12th 2007"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"7686","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7686.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7686.html"]}
