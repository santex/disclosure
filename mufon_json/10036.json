{"Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsat aprox. 19:45 mst i was talking on my cell to my v.p. re the days events, i was standing next to my pool in my backyard, when i looked upward into the sky to the south \\ southwest. i noticed a set of lights that caught my attention, they were moving, what appeared to be slowly from the southwest to the northeast. the light in the front was much brighter then the one in the trailing position both were white or off white in color. as i watched them progress for about 30 sec. it became apparent that they were not the normal lights i am accustom to seeing on aircraft flying into \\out of phoenix sky harbor int. i told my v.p. i was watching a ufo, of course he told me i wasent, i then called out to my girlfriend in the house to come outside and look at what i was seeing. i instructed her to not let it out of her sight while i retrieved my binoculars. upon my return the lights started to fade somewhat as i tried to bring the object into view, i wasent able to get a clear view through my binoculars for more than a few sec. so i wasent able to gather much about the mass or structure of the obj. it appeared to be aprox. 8000-10000 ft. agl. it made no sounds that i or we could hear. in my opinion as a general aviation pilot there were no position lights or strobe \\ anti collision lights of any sort on this craft, for lack of a better word. it moved at a steady pace and made no erratic movements of any kind, at first glance it appeared to be a comm. jet on approach to landing, however i have watched many jets fly over and can honestly say that what i saw this night wasent at all the same. we may never know."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-112.069487","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03252008-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.452027,+-112.069487(10036)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10036) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/24/2008 07:49 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"33.452027","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10036.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10036.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10036.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","City":"Phoenix","Date Submitted":"03/24/2008 07:49 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"10036","Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"observed 2 lights tracking across sky from s.w. to n.e dir. the ft. or lead light was 75% brighter than the one in trail they were in site for aprox. 3 min. then disapeared.","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around March 24th 2008"]}
