{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18076","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsAlready reported once, but now have photo to attach. I was in the Target parking lot in Westfield, and saw a red-orange fireball go from the Target store almost right above me to Clay Terrace. Travling north to south. Then I lost sight, but got four shots with a Nikon D90. This shot is zoomed in, but untouched. This was definately not an after-burner on a jet. It was going too slow, and no noise at all. My brother saw a red-orange orb in Kokomo just a few days before I saw this one. He said it looked like the same thing, and was surprised I got this good of a shot."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Westfield","There was one other sighting in Westfield on or around July 5th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"red-orange fireball in Westfield IN. on July 5th.
