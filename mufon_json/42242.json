It did not appear to be moving. I called my wife and she also observed it and said \"it looks like the others we saw last time and in same position almost.\" She was correct. Well my wife and kids went inside the house. I ran across the street and called my neighbor because he asked me to call him incase I ever observed an object again. Sure enough he saw it too and called his brother over the phone as I called my brother as well. I went back to my drive way and just leaned on my truck and kept looking straight up at the object which now seemed to move in a western direction ever so slow then back east again and then west again. I would estimate about 3 inches of travel from my point of view in either direction. 18 or so minutes later I heard what sounded like faint engines. I did not want to take my eyes off the object. As I kept looking at it, what appeared to be a P-3 Orion or similar configuration plane appeared, very, very high. I would estimate at around 10 thousand feet. It was a twin engine, long body plane. As it got to what appeared to be 4 inches from the object, the object just seemed to vanish. The plane was traveling West to East and just kept on going. The object did not reappear and hasnt as of yet."],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"09/02/2012 08:35 UTC","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/02/2012 06:20 UTC","Case Number":"42242","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Brownsville","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Brownsville","There were no other sightings in Brownsville on or around September 2nd 2012"],"Longitude":"-97.495564","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09022012-0034","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Hoving star like object, slowing moving east to west and back again"}
