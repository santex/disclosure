(about 6:30 am ) i thought that i was seeing things but right after that another one following each other was traveling very slowly like they were observing. not too many cars on the road but very few cars that were traveling in my direction were braking to watch. it was impossible to stop so i then stopped in the nearest station and called the non-emergency police 972 941-2142. they advised me to call faa ( 206 722-3000 ), which i did and got a voice mail of mr. davenport is full. i called the police back and they told me that was the only number they had and for me to report and also fill out form on line at www.ufocenter.com i saw total of 4 circle shape objects traveling slowly above hwy 121 with very bright lights perhaps 14-16 big round lights. thanks much"],"Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"01/29/2009 06:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle"}
