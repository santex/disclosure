Just hovering there. OCT 8th 2011 3:30pm in Knoxville, TN above my house. Clear sky and they were silver. I went inside tried to find camera came back out and 3 were gone. The last one started moving very slow and when I tried to look in my binoculars to see it and then couldn't see it so 5 seconds later when I pulled them from my eyes it was gone. I do not know who to go to or to see if anyone else around me seen the same thing. I tried to take a picture with my phone but you cant really see anything but 3 of them and they just look like dots in the sky.
