I first noticed the object when I looked up. A ******* UFO. See above chart. I answered your questions before. I was ready to punch the alien if it hurt me. But if it wanted to take me for a ride, I would have gone. I am sad that I didnt go on the UFO. The UFO went far away and I couldnt catch up to it when I was running. The ocean got in the way. I cant run on the ocean."],"trends":[],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-71.568915"}
