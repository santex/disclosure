When just above our horizon to our right, there appeared a LARGE turquoise ball with an attached tail streaming behind it. It followed our horizon which was curved as we were looking up a small incline in the road. It continued to the left then went out of sight behind some trees. There was no noise whatsoever while in the air nor if it crashed to earth. It absolutely took my breath away. I asked Greg, \"did you see that\"? He said yes. I immediately called my sister about it them proceeded to try and draw it very roughly. I am still in awe of that night. I cannot fathom that we were the only ones to witness it, but it was late and very cold."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
