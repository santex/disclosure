He filmed it for us. honestly we tried finding a logical explanation for this event but after watching the video numerous times. We can't. we did discover that when we watched it in slow mode. These were not flashing orbs but rolling orbs. what looks like flashing is it spinning forward and then back again. plus there was not just one. once it was slowed down you see more than one but like 2 stationary. its so hard to explain really. you also see it grow long and very bright and almost look like a scanner go up and down. we just want to know what it was. my roommate filmed all of this during a 45minute period. first started at like 5:05am then i think he sits in shock for a few minutes and then he films the rest from like 5:38 to like 5:45."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28014.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28014.html"],"Longitude":"-92.805776","Country":"United States","Summary":"Our roommate caught these LED blue color flashing orbs on video outside the fromt of our house looking out over our neighbors house towards the east.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.365465,+-92.805776(28014)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28014) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"28014"}
