Since I am a helicopter pilot, I found these lights peculiar for any operating aircraft to exhibit. These lights did not move and I quickly gained on them. Arriving abeam the lights, I clearly observed a dark shaped triangle, darker than the night sky. The object appeared stationary, approximately 400 feet of altitude, and less than a mile north of the highway. Due to traffic congestion, my attention was divided and therefore I was unable to fully scrutinize this object. Perplexed by what I had just seen, I drove on and subsequently lost sight of it. Hindsight, I wish I had found a place to pull over for further observation."],"Date of the Event":"09/10/2013 08:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON"}
