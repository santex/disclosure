I watched it for a couple seconds and brushed it off as a plane, thinking nothing of it. A minute or so goes by and I find myself gazing at it again. It has become much closer to my location and has another red orb of light pulsating steadily close to the constant red orb of light I first noticed. I watched these lights cross over my entire field of view in under a couple of minutes. Still not too sure as to what aircraft has only the red light that pulsates like so and creates no noise at all. Last night was one of the quietest nights I think I have ever experienced in this city. If anyone has any input as to what this UFO could be please share."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"32.952669","Case Number":"51818","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.952669,+-96.72031(51818)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51818) map </A>","Summary":"red pulsating orbs traveling across the dallas sky","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"10/23/2013 09:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/24/2013 11:17 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51818.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51818.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-96.72031"}
