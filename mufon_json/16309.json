I stopped and got out to get a better look and at the same time the whole night sky lit up in a bluish color and I saw something burning followed by these large orange sparks falling from behind the objects path. It all was followed by a large boom and disappeared. I thought maybe it looked a little bit like a flare but only the sparks and I myself have shot flares in the past while in the Coast Guard and none of them ever flew and reacted like the object I saw just then. When I got home a friend confirmed that he heard the boom and that it shook his house. His son saw the sky flashing and now I see that the news channels have reported it on the 11oclock news as treir top story. It may have been a meteorite but who knows for sure. All I know is that it was pretty exciting to witness and be a part of."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash","Longitude":"-75.974205","City":"Virginia Beach","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Blue flash of light followed by orange sparks.","Case Number":"16309","Region":"Virginia","Latitude":"36.860606"}
