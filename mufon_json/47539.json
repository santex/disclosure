The sun was not in the pics. The pics I have of the sun are very bright and overload the pictures. I have other pics of the sky that day in the same area. Because we were driving I was taking them quickly with my cell phone and didn't realize I had this object in the picture until I got home and was showing people pics of the clouds. It literally went straight up. Elizabeth Bishop was driving and observed the same thing. I have more pictures on my phone if you are interested."],"Longitude":"-74.000243","Latitude":"40.717243","Date of the Event":"05/05/2013 04:49 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47539.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47539.html"],"Region":"New York","Date Submitted":"05/20/2013 03:48 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Case Number":"47539"}
