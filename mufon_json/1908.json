I was driving home North on Route 213 in Southampton Pa.2. I first noticedthe object as I was driving up the hill on Rt. 213 before a traffic light. Icould see two orange like objects hovering over the horizon. They would hoverthen disappear then move forward and then backwards then to the left and right.I felt intensely sick from something and it seemed as though something orsomeone was trying to contact me. It was a fixated beam or something that feltlike it was pulling towards me or attracting my thoughts. Then time seemed tostop and I felt as though my mind was blanking. Then all I can remember iscontinuing to drive home with thoughts of grey like beings or more evolvedhumans. The message was to stop the war and unite as one. I lost sight of theufo in the trees. I was too scared to stop driving."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-74.922666","Latitude":"40.174554","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1908.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1908.html"],"trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Langhorne","There were no other sightings in Langhorne on or around October 8th 2002"],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Langhorne","Log Number":""}
