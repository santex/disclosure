come fly over here\" and both rh and jg simultaneously said, in so many words, \"don't come over here!\" we had a quick laugh and continued to observe the object. i think it was rh who said, \"why don't you give it a yell?\" i cupped my hands around my mouth and started to let loose with a mountain style yodel\\yell. as soon as i started to make a noise, the light suddenly changed with a solid flash of white to few dull blinking yellow lights. there was a random series of flashes, and the object began to move more steadily at a higher rate of speed toward the south. as this happened, we all became more excited, as it was entirely obvious that there was no mistaking this object as any conventional aircraft, leading us to the conclusion that this was in fact an unidentified flying object. we continued to watch the object as it faded in intensity and eventually disappeared behind my baden-powell. a straight trajectory would have taken it out over the pacific ocean. our total observation time was anywhere from one to two minutes. we had enough time to completely discuss and react to what we were seeing. later, back at the campfire (which i quickly stoked up) jg and i agreed that it almost appeared to be shaped like an old german army helmet with a light on the bottom, but neither of us could be sure to any degree of certainty. i drew what i saw in the dirt and he concurred that it was close to what he saw, but neither of us can be sure. rh said he could only saw the light. at this time, i should add that we are all completely sober, competent observers with excellent vision and senses. rh is a retired u.s. navy aviation machinist mate, 2nd class with tons of air time and experience. he also worked at edwards air force base for 30 years after leaving the service. during this time, he worked search and rescue in the san gabriel mountains for the la county sheriffs department. he has an intimate knowledge of the area and has spent countless hours, both on the ground and in the air in san gabriels. he agrees after discussing our observation that what we witnessed was not normal. all three of us were very open minded before this event, but i now feel even more confident that there is more going on in our world than what we are aware of. i feel very privileged to have seen what we saw. i feel confident enough that i have no qualms or second guessing about filing this report. i wonder if there were any other people who witnessed something similar that night or at other times in the area. were there any strange weather anomalies, military exercises or other events that night? maybe someone at mufon can let me know. thank you for your time."],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"None, Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wrightwood","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.360834,+-117.633388(17692)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17692) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/26/2009 11:59 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/26/2009 11:59 UTC","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-06272009-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown"}
