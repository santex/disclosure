we told our family about it too they were suspicious about things of that nature. that same night i have seen it again! i was doing some homework and i was up late close to 12am. my bedroom was upstairs and my window was facing east. that night was a clear night except a white lost cloud in the sky in front of my window, as i turned off the light to get in bed, i looked out the window because my bed was right next to it and i have seen the cloud flashing in colors, yellow, red, and green (jumping light) through the cloud as they were spinning at fast rate. colors i have never seen in my life! they were so intense the closest thing i could describe to you it would have to be a rainbow. it was the same disc going towards cayuga lake direction. i went out of the house to see if i can see it again. in few minutes i have seen it again coming from the same direction as the first time going towards the lake again. it was flying at extreme speeds, i never seen anything fly that fast i know it was something the air force doesn���t have. it was flying very fast and it made a 90 degree turn without even slowing down and disappeared. it was gone in less then 5 second out of the night sky and that was the last time i have seen it. i told some of my friends about it and they have seen similar things at different times in other close areas (dryden ny). upstate ny lots of people encountered flying discs has something to do with the cayuga lake. 2 years later after the first incident, i was in the same room sleeping (my bed was close to the wall and window).i woke up to a humming sound, the closest i can describe it, would have to be some kind of ventilator or vacuum. i was very tired that night and i thought that the noise it will go away whatever it is, it might be on the street (trumansburg rd). that noise it was going on for some time through out the night probably at least 30 min or so. i was waken up, i was going in and out of my sleep. as i mentioned my room was on the second floor, and my window was facing e. the only light that could have enter my room was the sun. as i was sleeping i was facing the wall and a bright light illuminated my room just like you have brought the sun in my room. it was night time no day ! i jumped up and turned around to see what it was but i haven���t seen anything. the noise was gone and also the light that entered my room. next day i went in the city, it was about 15:00pm. it was a cloudy afternoon but through the clouds something caught my eyes, i could see jumping lights of different colors again, going e very fast and was gone in 2 sec.this incident was at about the same location as 2 years earlier. that was the last time i have seen anything. i thought i share it with you guys. thanks for taking the time to read."],"City":"Ithaca","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Ithaca","There were no other sightings in Ithaca on or around September 22nd 1995","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Region":"New York","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/22/1995 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"42.450091","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"It was a circle object silver/platinium color and glass half bowl on top with light inside.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.450091,+-76.500381(14010)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14010) map </A>"}
