We noticed lights and looked towards the tree line. I thought it was a flying snake because it was so thin. It flew straight and descended below the tree line. From our view it was moving left to right. We were excited because we didn't know what it was. I thought it could be a prop plane or a drone, but it was way too thin and there was no noise. It looked like a large version of a silverfish bug with lights."],"Date of the Event":"05/04/2013 03:15 UTC","Case Number":"47173","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Other"}
