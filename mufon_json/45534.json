{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI had just came home and looked up at the constellation Orion. I noticed a triangle formation of lights and thought, that's weird. At second glance I noticed that the lights were all moving in the same SE direction. They were there for only a few moments, then one by one they faded out. I noticed that there was also a search light in the same general direction after the object had disappeared."],"City":"Spring","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45534.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45534.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.08598,+-95.41404(45534)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45534) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02022013-0014","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/02/2013 07:09 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Spring","There were no other sightings in Spring on or around February 2nd 2013"],"Date Submitted":"02/02/2013 09:16 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Star like, triangle, 3 points of light traveling in same direction.","Case Number":"45534","Latitude":"30.08598","Longitude":"-95.41404"}
