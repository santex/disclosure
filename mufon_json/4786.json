It didn't appear to be a vehicle, but looked more like a \"square hole\" because the interior of the square looked more like a \"portal\" rather than a vehicle. Strange. This is the first time I've ever experienced anything like this. We each went home and drew what we saw and our drawings were quite alike. In a matter of seconds, the object simply disappeared from sight and we were left wondering about our sanity."],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/12/2006 07:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"34.98007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.98007,+-105.022554(4786)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4786) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Black, hollow rectangle with lights","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
