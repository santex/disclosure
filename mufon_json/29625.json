Sky and visibility were clear . Wind was typical 10 to 15 mph and on shore . Noticed a round shiny thingy(?) traveling app. north to south at a pretty good rate of speed over a hundred miles an hour (?). Size may have been 20 to 40 feet in diameter and guessing the altitude at about 15-2500 feet . What struck me was how fast it was moving and as it was moving in a straight line against the wind .Not a ballon , plane or jet . I was only able to see it and clearly for 10-15 seconds before it was no longer visible. Don't know what I saw but no ballon travels AGAINST the wind ! Anyways ,happy fathers day to all ."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"I was traveling west on hwy 12.
