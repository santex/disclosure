This is on Casey Key south of Sarasota by about 15 miles. I was looking at the stars and noticed a star that seemed to change intensity and slightly shifted spectral color. There were no clouds present to distort the view. Moon was at full and a breeze from the gulf at maybe 5 knots. As I continued to look at this star and the surrounding sky the \"star\" blinked out. I was a bit surprised as I never mistook it for anything other than a star. I have been working in aviation for 31 years and have seen just about every type of aircraft you can imagine. What this was I am uncertain of. I can tell you it never moved laterally or changed altitude. It was not a jet or a helicopter. There was no noise or contrail. I could not tell you what the altitude would have been as again it appeared to be a star at first. I was quite taken aback so I continued to watch the area where it had been for several minutes but it did not reappear."],"Longitude":"-82.444263","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27461.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27461.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/20/2011 09:13 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Case Number":"27461","Latitude":"27.119221"}
