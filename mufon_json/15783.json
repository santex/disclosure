I then preceded to walk outside and look at them. They were four lights that looked like a blank projection on the clouds and they just went in a pattern. At first I believed that it was just spotlights but than my sister said they had moved from a nearby city called Marysville, and I also heard about other reports and decided it was indeed a alien craft or some type of military test.
