Put grocieries in truck. I was taking the buggy to the return area when I noticed one diamond shaped object in the sky.It wasnt moving. It glowed a redish-orange color in a steady light patern;like an LED strip. Seconds later a second object of the same description appeared rigth beside the first. one would disappear then re-appear...then the other...and they began to \"dance\" eside each other...then at once they both disappeared. When I saw the first one I immediately knew it was not a normal aircraft. I just stopped in the middle of the parking lot...unable to move. Just starring. When the second appeared I was literally frozen in place. I wasnt afraid. Just frozen. Ive never seen anything like it. I was on the phone with my boyfriend and described to him what I was seeing as it happened. There was no one near me so I dont know if anyone else saw or not."],"Object Shape":"Diamond","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"33.69564","Country":"United States","City":"Myrtle Beach","Region":"South Carolina","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Myrtle Beach","There were no other sightings in Myrtle Beach on or around January 15th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45233.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45233.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"45233"}
