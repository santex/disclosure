I did not realize that the UFO was in the sky until I got home and saw the photograph. I have sent it to several friends of mine for comment. I have seen one before in Elm Creek, Nebraska in July of 1972, I was with a friend of mine when we saw it. They are real.I am going to try to attach the picture with this report.
