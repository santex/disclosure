{"Latitude":"36.099197","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking my 5 minute work break in the afternoon when this happened. I looked up to the sky because I was told a blimp was in town. The object apeared like a dark hawk or large bird just riding the upper currents of wind. It wasn't! No flapping wings, perfect triangle in a cloudless sky. In total disbelief I reach for my phone to get video, but i couldn't take my eyes off the ufo. I haven't even looked at the video yet. This triangle ufo traversed the entire sky in a matter of about 15 seconds and vanished. This defied all logical reasoning. I'm still coming to terms with what I witnessed. I'll check what's on my phone for posting, but the ufo was high in the sky and I seriously doubt it will show up. This happened about 4pm in Fayetteville, AR on June 1st 2012. Video should give the exact time."],"City":"Fayetteville","Case Number":"38738","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.099197,+-94.15056(38738)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38738) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06022012-0005","Summary":"Black Triangle UFO shot across the sky in broad daylight.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38738.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38738.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/01/2012 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Fayetteville","There were no other sightings in Fayetteville on or around June 1st 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Arkansas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.15056","Date Submitted":"06/02/2012 01:03 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
