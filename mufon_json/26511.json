The size seemed to big to be an airplane light but it could have been an airplane reflecting light?? As I passed some trees I lost sight of it, and when I got to a clearing it had disappeared. It was a very overcast day with very heavy, dark grey clouds and this object was very bright and stood out amongst the dark clouds. It was almost like someone was flashing a large, bright light in the sky. I saw it very briefly, maybe 15 seconds. In that brief moment, it did not seem to move. It just seemed such an odd sight, that I kept staring at it. I'm posting in hopes someone else in the area saw it too."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Star-like","Summary":"Very bright light against a very cloudy, overcast sky.","Date Submitted":"11/11/2010 10:34 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Washington","Date of the Event":"11/09/2010 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-122.894505","Log Number":"US-11112010-0010","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26511.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26511.html"]}
