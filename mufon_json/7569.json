FYI - I am a former Navy carrier pilot and very cognizant of things that fly and mechanical things of all sorts. I could hear no mechanical sounds or rotor beat or propeller noise. Just the powerful rushing sound. There was no turbine whine, just the whooshing that a turbine exhaust might make. I was unable to get to a window or outside in time to see where the sound was coming from. I'd estimate that its altitude was less than 1,000 feet. I know of no flying machine which might make such a noise and move so slowly. It seemed to remain in the area at some distance for nearly an hour. This report certainly does not offer much by itself, but may corroborate someone else's."],"Log Number":"US-08012007-0003","City":"Redmond","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
