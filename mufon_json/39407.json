I'm watching the top right corner of the 4 dimensional squares and I can see an alien inside our house. Anyway.. the next thing I know I'm screaming really loud and my parent bust in, no one is there. The next day my room is a disaster, all the clothes thrown and scattered very awkwardly across the floor in a way where you cant see the floor. My parents thought I did it and I was spanked for it, they don't know why it was like that. This was either a burglar or an encounter but the memory is very real, I am 100% positive that I wasn't dreaming when this happened to me. I urinated in bed for years after this memory"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39407.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39407.html"],"Log Number":"US-06172012-0010","City":"San Antonio","Case Number":"39407","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"29.479656","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around August 7th 1984"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-98.574736"}
