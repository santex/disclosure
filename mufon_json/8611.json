philadelphia near the neshaminy mall in the early evening sometime mid to late september of 1974. as i walked i noticed an unusually bright light on the southern horizon. i stopped to observe the unusual light. it appeared to vary in brightness, as if to pulse at regular but slow intervals. i continued to watch the object for several minutes and noted that the general brightness of the pulse was increasing over time. a short later i realized that the object was not pulsing at all but actually moving north and then receding southward in a regular linear pattern all the while nudging its overall positon northward slowly and inextricably approaching my vantage point. it seemed to follow the course of rt. 1 north in the direction of trenton, nj. at this time i noticed two other bright lights moving in and out of my peripheral field of vision positioned one on the east side of the original light and the other on the west side of the object. these objects moved quite differently than the first. they also were moving northward slowly following the line established by the center object but rather than moving alternately southward and northward in the fashion of the central object, they zig-zaged back and forth from west to east and alternately east to west in a pattern mirroring one another on either side of the central object but never overlapping it as if the pattern of the center object formed a demarcation or boundry that neither ancillary object crossed. all three objects were nudging slowly northward following their perscribed patterns of movement. my impression was that they were either looking for something or surveying the area. there was nothing at all random about their movement and they were absolutely coordinated in a way that implied a centralized plan or control. this continued for some time. i estimate roughly ten to fifteen minutes. eventually their position against the southern horizon lowered to the point that the surrounding trees impeded my view and they disappeared ... or so i thought. i stood awed for several minutes really sad that the incident was over thinking that i wanted to get a further view of the ballet i had witnessed and actually praying that they would come back. after several more minutes my wishes suddenly were granted when i heard a high pitched but low volume whirring sound like a jet enigine with a huge muffler on steroids. i could not get a fix on the direction from which the sound was coming until i looked up and realized that an object was literally several hundred feet in the air and almost directly overhead. i could no longer see bright light or light at all for that matter ... only the dark underside could be seen silhoueted against the surrounding night sky. i could not make out any of the surface details of the underside of the object. it was simply a blacker circle against a nearly black backgroud. at the same time i looked east and noticed that one of the other objects was hovering over a small copse of trees maybe two or three blocks east but making no sound at all that i could make out. this object's outline was similar in shape to the outline of a football and my guess was that it was disc shaped although it was difficult to tell due to the darkness. it had a row of lights that outlined the shape. they were multi-tinted with different shades of color more like tints than hard colors. i never saw what would have been the third object after that time. i believe it would have had to have been the object west of the central one. it simply was not there anymore and i had no idea where it had moved off to. the object making the whirring sound situated over my head was quite large and i believe it was the one positioned in the center that was moving in the linear north\\south direction although it is impossible to say for sure since i had lost sight of all of the objects for several minutes when they fell below my line of sight. i estimate it to have been 100+ feet in diameter. it was dark and moving very slowly overhead at maybe 5 mph. it was extremely disconcerting knowing that nothing that large i had ever seen could possibly remain in the sky even under power. the object to my east over the tress did not move at all. my impression was that they were aware they were being observed and were in fact observing me. at that point i was fairly alarmed and wondering why the air force wasn't chasing these guys. after minute or two both objects began moving off in a northeastery direction and though i gave chase on foot i lost sight of them very quickly. several impressions come to mind. first was that they were there for a reason to perform a specific task. second ... every motion was coordinated and the objects were communicating with one another. i was both exhilerated and frightenend at the same time. as crazy as it sounds, at times i felt that they actually knew what i was thinking and that at least in the final stages of the encounter i was being observed which made me very, very uneasy. in the end, after a couple minutes of watching me watch them i proved uninteresting to them and they went about their other business. i was astonished that no one else seemed to have had this experience or reported the lights ... but to be truthful i am not sure if others reported sightings to authorities or not. it was about this time that police officers reported a ufo landing in the newtown industrial commons maybe 7 miles north of where i was. i think the two are related. i refrained from reporting what i had seen because it seemed so unreal to me at the time, even though i knew i had experinced the event. i was convinced that it was possible to have been a kind of hallucinagenic stress related fantasy because i was under a lot of stress at that time in my life ... but it appeared quite real when it happened. i think it did happen so after all these years i want to get it on record. i have no means to do a computer aided map of the event and movements but i could draw it and send it snail mail if you requested it."]}
