(especially not out in the middle of winter in an empty fallow field at 3am...) i searched the area the next day to see if i could gain access back to where it was at and it was impossible. there were no access or fire trail roads, driveways, farm roads, or anything. there were no houses nearby or barns or any kind of structure. (that's why we parked out there; there wasn't anybody we would bother and the cops never came out that way.) no power lines or towers are out there either; nothing. as said this is just a huge fallow field with a old windbreak tree line out back. the field had very tall field grass that was matted down heavy with snow and it was simply impossible to walk through this to get out there, i tried very hard to do this, but it was not humanly possible on foot. the object was long gone the next morning four hours later. i wanted to try and see what it had been doing. it looked like maybe it was doing something with the ground or those trees behind it, or maybe some kind of self maintenance? who knows? wish i did, i can tell you that much... we all watched this a long while as said, just amazed at what we were seeing. (we were not drunk just to set the record straight on that.) it was up to something out there. then it was suddenly unanimous among us; we all got this feeling like this thing was watching us back, almost as if it were examining us, and it really scared hell out of us all. we all became very frightened by it and decided it was time to leave. my friends watched it out the back window of the van as i drove away with the lights off, trying not to draw any attention to ourselves, that's how frightened we all became of this thing. when we got back in town we sat and discussed this for another hour or so. i got no sleep that night and went back out there not long after to investigate as said above. it was long gone... after never mentioning this for thirty years to any of the others (we seldom get together any more) i got together with one of these guys and said i needed to talk to him about something that happened a long time ago when he was with me. strange enough he knew exactly what i wanted to ask him about and spit right out with \"oh you mean the light out in the field that night\".... i was amazed he knew without any provocation. evidently he was thinking of it from time to time himself. one of the others has passed on now, and the two of us are trying very hard to remember who the forth friend was. we will figure it out soon. i will guarantee you they remember this with striking clarity. for thirty years i seldom thought of this event. now in the last year it seems to bother me a lot for some reason. don't know why, but i think about it a lot, so i decided its time to tell the story. well there you have it. i would love to talk to you on the phone about this if possible."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","City":"Manchester","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/10/1979 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/17/2009 09:14 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Michigan"}
