Looked up to see the beautiful night sky which filled with high, puffy clouds that were reflecting the moon and I could see a few stars here and there. My eyes quickly fell upon what seemed to be a classic ���spycraft��� triangle UFO. I quickly discerned it wasn���t a plane, although at first I thought it was because it had flashing lights like one. One light was white, the other red, and the other blue if I remember right. It also may have had a blinking light in the middle. I haven���t a clue how high up it was but it seemed a bit higher than the clouds and seemed not much bigger than my index finger from a distance, and it was moving about as fast as a plane. No engine sounds although that didn���t surprise me at all considering the height it appeared to be at. I thought \"Cool! I'm seeing a UFO! Wonder just what it is and where it came from!\", but I did not (and don't) consider it a big deal, and consider it a mostly fleeting, not-too-spectacular experience. My assumption it was one of those spyplane things. Why it had flashing, blaring lights though when it���s supposed to be spying is beyond me! But that���s what I think it may have been as we have an Air Force base nearby. But of course there's no way to know for sure."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Spokane","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16482.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16482.html"],"Latitude":"47.66537","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"16482"}
