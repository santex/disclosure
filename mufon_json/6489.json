As I scanned the clear sky, a very bright light shone to the east. At first I thought it was just a star, but its brightness and the fact that it was moving definitely ended that notion. The fact that the lights didnt blink often, and that it was moving so fast and in an upwards direction made me so sure it was something that wasnt ours. As I stared at it, it went in a up and left motion, until it went behind a tree. As I continued to watch for it to emerge, I was disappointed and startled, as it never came out from behind the tree. This is not the first time that I have seen this in my area, not only have I seen this before, but so has my father and grandfather, all just like this, my grandfather even saw one land up in the hills."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.398428,+-75.723525(6489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6489) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/03/2007 11:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Large Star-Like object rises straight up and disappears behind tree.","City":"Pikeville","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pikeville","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
