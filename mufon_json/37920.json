We were opening up her hot tub when I had noticed a bright light in the sky that was initially stationary, I pointed it out because it looked like a beautiful bright star until it began to get brighter then began moving. I immediately had my friend (fellow witness) look up to make sure what I was seeing was not just a star and that it was actually moving. We both noticed a more triangular shape to the bright light as it began to move faster as if descending from a very high altitude slowly while moving through the night sky. We both pointed out that it was not a plane because there were a few planes moving through the night sky as well with the usual airplane lights and size, however this object seemed to be about 4 times the size of a commercial airliner when observed from the ground.We both tryed to capture it on video with our cell phones but when we tried getting it on our cell phone cameras nothing appeared in the sky. I am not sure what exactly this was, I am not saying it was an alien space ship, nor am I saying it was something of our own technology, it was very strange, I know what planes look like, I myself can not figure out what this was but it was nothing that I have ever seen before."],"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Charleston","There were no other sightings in Charleston on or around May 4th 2012"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.35942,+-81.627773(37920)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37920) map </A>"}
