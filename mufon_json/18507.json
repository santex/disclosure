{"Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08062009-0005","Latitude":"35.955374","Region":"Oklahoma","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the way to work - I work the night shift and start at 10:00pm - I was getting ready to get on the highway at 121st S and Highways 75. We were starting to have heavy clouds move in as a storm front was coming in. I glanced up at the clouds and a glowing orange sphere dropped out of the clouds. The sphere then went back up into the clouds, and came back down a few seconds later. Again the sphere went back up into the clouds, came down one final time, and then was gone behind the clouds. There was lightning activity in the sky, but this was not lightning as it had a shape and was not flashing or anything, just like a glowing orange orb. It is possible this was ball lighting - plasma - as I have never seen it before, but as this is something I can not explain I thought I would report. Thank you."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/15/2009 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18507.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18507.html"],"Longitude":"-96.008884","Weather Factors":"Lightning, Light","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Orange glowinging sphere in the clouds","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Glenpool","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"18507","Date of the Event":"07/15/2009 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.955374,+-96.008884(18507)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18507) map </A>","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Glenpool","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
