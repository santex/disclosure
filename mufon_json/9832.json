I was driving along with him riding passenger, and he yells out \"UFO alert\", and I turned to see the most amazing thing. Flying beneath the cloud covered skies was a formation of about 10-15 glowing orbs. egg or football shaped. They were being flanked by another craft, bigger and with more lights. It was almost like it was shepherding them, because it's the only ship that would break formation. This happened at about 10 PM EST in Youngstown, Ohio. It was the most surreal experience of my life. It lasted about 15 seconds before the fleet went into the clouds and disappeared."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","City":"Youngstown","Case Number":"9832","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.10884,+-80.644519(9832)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9832) map </A>","Object Shape":"Egg","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.644519","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Summary":"My nephew and I saw a fleet of UFOs flying in formation","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Youngstown","There were no other sightings in Youngstown on or around March 2nd 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/02/2008 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/02/2008 12:00 UTC"}
