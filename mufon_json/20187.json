Southern California at this time was covered in dark, gray skies. The object appeared through the cloud formations and appeared not to move for prolonged periods of time. After approximately twenty minutes, in seemed to recede farther in the distance until completely enveloped by the clouds. When seen moving, the craft sailed upon a straight trajectory (indicating intelligently-controlled) and also arced high and behind the tree seen in the photograph. As the form allows only 3 photographs to be uploaded at a time, please check the following reports which will carry the rest of them. There are 13 in total - some the original shot - others a maximized, zoomed in version indicated by their title."]}
