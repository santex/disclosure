We were laying in the bed of the truck, i was showing them stars in the sky. I noticed that there was a very large glowing light above the mountain. it began to move very fast changing direction every second. Then 2 helicopters appeared behind it. at that point it flashed 2 times and sped of at the speed of light. leaving a light trail behind it. Me and my friends were very scared and left. (about 1 hour before we saw the object there was a large flash of light that came from behind the mountain. we thought it might be lightning or something but now i think it was somehow related to the UFO event) i tried to take a video but it was to dark outside."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
