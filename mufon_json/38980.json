{"divs":["Sighting DetailsJune 7 2012, I was taking my dog out to use the restroom at 11:20pm, Im into astronomy heavily, so I always star gaze. When I looked up, the object appeared to resemble Venus, which is no longer in the sky. I kept looking at it for about 1-2 minutes wondering what it was. Then it just started moving on its own, the light was extremely bright, then dimmed out all of the sudden, you could still clearly see it, just not as well. For example if at its brightest it was a 10, it dimmed to around a 3. Then it came back to a 10 and stopped moving for about 1 mintue. Then it started to move again, for about another 5 minutes it didnt dim, just moved in a directional path. The object then went back to a 3 while moving for about another 5 minutes and stopped. Again it came back to a 10, started moving again and disappeared behind a tree line. It was close to about 40 mins of activity before I couldnt see it anymore."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.897813","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/08/2012 12:57 UTC","Case Number":"38980","Region":"Ohio","Date of the Event":"06/07/2012 11:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06082012-0013","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38980.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38980.html"],"Latitude":"40.424577","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":[],"Summary":"Bright light appeared as star with hovering and fast movement.","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.424577,+-82.897813(38980)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38980) map </A>"}
