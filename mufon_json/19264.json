I was a kid approx8 yrs old. My dad, my brother Pat and I were on our way back from Rapid City SD late one evening when a bright white light flew over head. We were on I 90 headed west approx at the Blackhawk exit outside of Rapid City SD and my dad pulled over on shoulder to watch it. With in a few minutes it took off like a shot and 2 jet fighters flew overhead chasing the object. We never knew what it was and from all reports neither did the Airforce. This is only a touch of what I observed growing up in Sturgis from age 5 till 20. As you know Ellsworth airbase was very close and there were missle silos everywhere.It was amazing all the activity we observed sitting on top of our hill on Weber Drive in Sturgis. My Dad was amazed when I reminded him of ot all and he remembers alot as well."],"City":"Sturgis","Source":"MUFON","Region":"South Dakota","Summary":"Bright light flying low over head while were on our way home from rapid City SD","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19264.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19264.html"],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-103.509079","Log Number":"US-09122009-0010"}
