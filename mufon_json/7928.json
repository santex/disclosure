(i'm not religious) so unless god was doing a magic trick for me, that was the number one unexplainable thing i have ever witnessed. i called everyone that same night\\morning that's quite a few people; they all believed me, a few even mentioned they have seen plenty of things in the sky similar in their countries as their nights are much clearer than ours, one even laughed and told me, come to my country and you will see something is happening in the skies that we are not being told. my friends are from all over - israel, peru, ecquador, brazil, england etc.. next day and after that, i was researching everything, every website, current stories, ufo sites, recent news etc... to see if anyone saw or reported the same or similar. nothing, however, strange things started happening after that - i won't mention so people start thinking i'm nutty - one thing i will mention is 3 nights after, a helicopter was flying continuously directly over my building\\area for approx. 30 minutes between 3-4am in the morning. that was extremely unusual in this very quiet neighborhood..in manhattan period! especially at that time of morning. i figured it had to be military in type due to the very loud sound of the roters. i looked out and up and i could see only the shape, but also three bright large square lights under it. i didn't know helicopters had huge lights like that underneath them, they were not search lights, more like the bottom of the helicopter. i have since gone and bought a serious camcorder with night vision and infrared with extended magnification. i am now fully equipped ..sorry for the long story, but i have not been the same and i don't like not knowing, especially after what i saw."],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There was one other sighting in New York on or around July 31st 2007"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New York","Latitude":"40.716003","Date Submitted":"07/31/2007 12:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/31/2007 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09162007-0006","Longitude":"-73.999573","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"New York","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown"}
