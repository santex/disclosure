It was also observed by a neighbour who lived across the street from my friend.I was just told about it last night. Sometime in 2004 (I was not given an exact date), my brother and friends were sitting around hanging out in the evening. My brother and one friend were sitting with their backs toward the window, and the other friend (who was the tenant in this apartment) was across from them, facing the window. According to their description, a bright orange light appeared outside the window and was sort of bobbing around. The light was described as being \"about the size of a football\". It did this for a minute or two and then flew away very fast, on an angle. It was heading roughly east, and ascending as it went. My brother and the 2 friends went outside to see if anyone else saw it and a man who lived across the street said that he had seen it hovering outside my friend's building as well."],"Longitude":"-63.572352","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Halifax","There were no other sightings in Halifax on or around November 30th 2003"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25018.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"25018"}
