{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile traveling South on Marsh Hill Rd in Orange, CT, approaching Rt 95 intersection, I saw through spotty rain clouds a bright object that was moving extremely quickly. The blue and white lights illuminated the clouds as it travelled through them. The angle of it's path looked like a meteor. I watched the lights move across the horizon from left to right, disappearing into dense clouds and the tree line. Total time was approx 3-5 seconds. A few seconds after I lost sight of it I saw a bright flash of light from the direction the lights were traveling, much like a camera flash. I saw this from the corner of eye as I was looking forward driving south."],"Region":"Connecticut","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.246489,+-72.998743(37437)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37437) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"37437","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Milford","There were no other sightings in Milford on or around April 12th 2012"],"Longitude":"-72.998743","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/12/2012 08:10 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/13/2012 10:14 UTC","City":"Milford","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37437.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37437.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Blue-White lights seen through clouds, very fast, looked like meteor","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.246489","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-04132012-0012"}
