Looked up and spotted object. The object was soundless and had no defining features. No other lights seen, just a burning orb. Appeared to ascend to the cloud-line and then moved slowly north. At this time, another had appeared in the spot of the original and hovered, then slowly ascended through the cloud cover and seemed to dissolve. Myself and one other were fascinated; the rest of our party paid little attention. These objects appeared to be directly above us, but there was no fear, only curiosity. Myself and the other witness had seen something similar about 1 year prior. Oddly, we witnessed the same type of orb above the same area and airspace, at about the same time of night but from 5 km north. At that time, the object we saw seemed to fizzle out as it moved to the east."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Vancouver","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-03242013-0018","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"03/24/2013 08:56 UTC","Case Number":"46389","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.279842,+-123.110626(46389)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46389) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46389.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46389.html"],"Latitude":"49.279842","Longitude":"-123.110626","Date of the Event":"03/23/2013 09:00 UTC","Region":"British Columbia","Summary":"glowing, as if on fire.
