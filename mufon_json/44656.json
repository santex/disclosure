We both saw it and slowed our speed because it was blinding to drive with the reflection, and as quick as it was there it was gone. I do not know who the person in front of me was, they drove a dark red compact car. It progressed out of site at a rate of speed that no airplane can travel and was gone from site. Normally I would try to take pics from my phone, but this event left me dumbfounded, I still can't believe I am talking about this.
