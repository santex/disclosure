The event is very similar to the event I reported on 4-29-07, the only difference being the object was out near the horizon and I was able to get three pictures using my Kodak Z740 Digital Camera. Again, as same as the last time, the object remained stationary for a good hour above the ocean before heavy cloud cover made it impossible to observe. When I magnified the image up to 8x using the cameras built in system, the object appeared to be diamond shaped. As soon as I can transfer the images to my computer, I will upload the pictures."],"trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Boca Raton","There were no other sightings in Boca Raton on or around May 27th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/27/2007 04:40 UTC","Region":"Florida","City":"Boca Raton","Source":"MUFON"}
