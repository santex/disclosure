Immediately I cried to my wife to look out the window. She also noticed the object. Obviously it was not an aircraft. The object was too big and of an unusual shape. To my mind its was a bullet-like something, dazzling and leaving a trace of a parabolic form. I should say that it was just 15 minutes before the midnight and therefore almost dark outside, and the object itself was like a fireball spreading the light strictly within the parabolic trace. So, it was like a huge kite. We were watching the object for about a minute and then, due to the limited field of view from the window we'd lost it. I called to a friend of mine and imparted the news to him. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to shoot the event."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Perm","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
