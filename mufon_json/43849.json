Object at first appeared to be a civilian aircraft on course for the airport landing strip, but changed direction from S to SE and finally hovering before going straight E. Object was pulsing a very bright white light, and at times pointing the light different directions, object was silent and began blinking a red, green, and blue light in a triangular patter while flying over myself and friend right behind a large building and parking lot. Must have been under 3-400 feet, as it was seemingly headed for a landing at various moments, and moving very slowly at times hovering, before disappearing. Lost sight of object over building as it changed direction to go dead East. Have seen this object many times recently, usually in the Eastern sky at night moving around slowly, pulsating light. Very strange to see it fly directly over my position..."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"42.010834","Source":"MUFON"}
