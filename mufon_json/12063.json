I happened to look up and was amazed to see an object in the sky with a short comet like tail. I was surprised as it seemed unusual. So I ran inside to get my monocular. I came back and observed it with the monocular. It seemed to be disc shaped, but was still too far away to make it out clearly. But since it looked more disc shaped than jet shaped, I ran back in and got my camera. It is a Sony Cybershot 7.2 megapixal. I keep it set on fine to get the highest resolution I can. I took about five still shots of which two show it pretty clearly. The object definitely appears disc shaped when you zoom in on the image. I then switched to video mode and filmed it for several minutes. The sun was starting to set and my settings must not have been so good. I am not able to see the object on the video because the sky appears too bright. I don���t know how to adjust the brightness on a video unless you go in frame by frame. I know I can try to go in and freeze a frame and adjust it, but have not tried that yet. The object was traveling from the NE to the SW so it was traveling somewhat in the direction of the setting sun. As I was filming it a helicopter flew by, much closer in range. I don���t know if they noticed this other object in the sky. I also heard the helicopter very well and yet I heard no sound from the object, although it seemed to be flying around the same height that most jets seem to fly. I can always here them in my location The object and its short comet like tail were very bright; almost hot white, with a tinge of yellow. I watched and filmed it until it disappeared behind the tree line in the west."],"Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/13/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"disc with comet tail","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Denton","There were no other sightings in Denton on or around August 13th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"33.218751","Log Number":"US-08142008-0004"}
