{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside to take my dog out and looked up at the night sky and saw our local UFO acting very agigtated and angry. He was all over the sky, doing circles both horizontal and like a ferris wheel, zig zagging all over the place, up and down and turning its light on and off at random intravels. Earlier that day we had a visit by a pair of strange UFO's in daylight. The two dark UFO's passed over around 7pm just after we had finished supper at a local resteraunt. I reported this sighting on March 31, 2013, I thought it would be interesting to others about how other things besides people and animals to react to this event. I have been observing this UFO for the last 22 years and have never seen him react like this to a visit from other ones."],"Latitude":"36.685065","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Cassville","There was one other sighting in Cassville on or around March 31st 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46607.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46607.html"],"Log Number":"US-04052013-0011","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"Missouri","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/05/2013 05:58 UTC","Longitude":"-93.86843","Summary":"Reaction of local UFO after a vist by strange UFO in daylight (two dark objects)","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Cassville","Case Number":"46607","Date of the Event":"03/31/2013 09:55 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.685065,+-93.86843(46607)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46607) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
