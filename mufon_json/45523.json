{"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside sky watching like I do from time to time and not having any luck lately, when all of a sudden I noticed a moving object. Thinking it was a plane because I live near an airport and see planes quite frequently I didn't think much of it. However, I noticed it was pulsating and seemed to be changing colors from white to green, not entirely sure though but it seemed too. There were no aviation lights, no sound and it traveled across the sky for about ten minutes until it went out of view entirely. It moved pretty slow. I have seen objects such as this before, but never witnessing it this long. I was completely fascinated and couldn't take my eyes off of it. It was a very weird situation! I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but it was too dark to see anything unfortunately. Hopefully one day I will be able to get a picture of one of these objects."],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Date of the Event":"02/02/2013 05:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.76504,+-94.675008(45523)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45523) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45523.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45523.html"],"Summary":"Pulsating Star Like Object","Latitude":"29.76504","Case Number":"45523","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"02/02/2013 06:50 UTC","Longitude":"-94.675008","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Region":"Texas","City":"Anahuac","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-02022013-0004","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Anahuac","There were no other sightings in Anahuac on or around February 2nd 2013"],"Tags":"City"}
