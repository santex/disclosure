Asked me to identify object in sky. I saw an airliner with contrails and said so. He said no--other object--what is it? I saw a bright silver oval-to-cylindrical object. No wings. No fuel trail. It appeared to be moving similar speed to the plane. Plane was moving south and east. UFO moving north and slightly east. UFO was at lower altitude and crossed under the plane's contrail, just at the rear of the plane. Plane and UFO trajectories created and \"x\". I went in the house. A minute later husband called to come as there was another. I looked up and verified second object, also silver. Less shiney. More cylindrical. Second object followed exact path of first which was no longer visible. Second object had FIRE COMING FROM BACK END. Husband said it looked like a missile. We are approx. 150 mi NE of SAC AF base in Omaha. I wondered if the second object was launced to destroy first object. Or collect data?? Both objects did not veer from the original, straight-line path. Both objects continued path til out of view."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.883332,+-93.093912(42444)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42444) map </A>","Summary":"2 bright silver cylinder objects","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42444.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42444.html"],"Case Number":"42444","Date of the Event":"09/09/2012 05:43 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
