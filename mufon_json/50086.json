{"Longitude":"-122.918054","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oregon","Latitude":"44.532036","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing outside my home watching stars and satellites cross the sky. Easily can tell satellites between planes and stars as satellites move rather fast (20,000 mph or so) and hold course and have no blinking lights on them. Anyhow, I was watching what I thought was a satellite cross the sky east to west when all of a sudden this light shot outward into space at what must have been easily 100,000 mph+. It was so fast that it almost looked like a lightning strike shooting from our sky into outer space. There was no sound at all. I just stood there in shock watching the point out in space where the light vanished wondering if it would come back. It never did. Please tell me someone else saw this."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50086.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50086.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Lebanon","There were no other sightings in Lebanon on or around March 15th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.532036,+-122.918054(50086)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50086) map </A>","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Star like light accelerated to unbelievable speeds after direction change.","Date of the Event":"03/15/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-08232013-0014","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Case Number":"50086","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Lebanon","Date Submitted":"08/23/2013 03:35 UTC"}
