Then as i kept driving some went away. then i went to a hill to watch them and there were two, and they stood still for about ten minuets, and i thought they weere just telephone poles. then the one on the left got very big and bright, then the light got really small and started flying away to the rightand it really freaked me out. about three minuets after the first light started moving the other light started to follow it, and they both dissapeared in the distance."],"Date Submitted":"08/17/2010 12:53 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/16/2010 08:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-08172010-0002","Region":"Colorado","Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"There were about seven bright lights in the sky sitting still then one by one started moving away.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.760223,+-105.2117(25116)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25116) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25116.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25116.html"]}
