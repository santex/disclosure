I asked her to draw a picture of it and it was as she described it. I know she saw it. I would like to know if anyone else saw this in the southeast kentucky area."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Disc","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around June 14th 2008"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"11218","Log Number":"US-06182008-0011","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"orange main body, with colored lights","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-84.081635","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
