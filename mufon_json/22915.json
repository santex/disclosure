It was just by chance that I was at the right spot to get a view of it. I had just walked out the back door of the house and when I looked up, there it was. At first I could not figure out what it was. Then after I watched it for several seconds it became more obvious to me. It came from the southwest. Way up high to the west in the night sky. Moving northeast and inland from over the gulf of Mexico. It was obvious to me that the thing was very large and very high up in the atmosphere.The object was on fire and it appeared to me that chunks of the object where breaking off and followed by tongues of flame they fell away behind. The pace of the object across the sky and flames coming off it gave the obvious impression of a very large object entering earths atmosphere. The object proceeded north easterly and in a couple of minutes was gone from view, pine trees having blocked the view of the objects progress. I turned to go back in the house. 'That' I thought, 'was highly unusual'"],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:30","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.165023,+-85.651076(22915)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22915) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball, Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"I walked out the back door and there it was, way up high to the west","Log Number":"US-04202010-0015","Latitude":"30.165023","Date of the Event":"08/15/2005 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Panama City","There were no other sightings in Panama City on or around August 15th 2005"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Case Number":"22915","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"04/20/2010 11:14 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-85.651076","City":"Panama City"}
