They were a very vivid red, and as we watched we could see them moving around a bit. Wondering what they were, we watched them for several minutes. While I'm assuming these lights represented objects, I never saw anything but the lights. Furthermore, there was little to no cloud cover so if these were objects it would be very difficult to say how far away they were. After we had watched them move in no discernible pattern for several minutes, we were shocked to see them start to pulsate a bit, one by one, then disappear. This was the end of the sighting. I had heard of people seeing things they could not explain in the sky before, but not until then had I seen anything myself."],"Longitude":"-119.860972","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36768.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36768.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Isla Vista","There was one other sighting in Isla Vista on or around March 23rd 2012"],"City":"Isla Vista","Case Number":"36768","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"5 solid red lights.
