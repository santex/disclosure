It was so bright you couldn't see anything else around it. It was due east at app. 25 degrees off the horizon. I watched it for a few min. it never moved. To make sure it wasn't moving I allinged my eye sight with my neighbor roof to see if it would go behind the roof or up or to the left or right, never moved so I thought it was a planet or some star. the next night I went at the same time just to check there was nothen there. no star no bright light nothing and it was at the exact time as the night before. if it was a star or planet it would have been close to the same area. I guess I saw a ufo and didn't even know it. it is still strange to me as to what it was"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.815237,+-97.000138(17705)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17705) map </A>","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Victoria","There was one other sighting in Victoria on or around June 26th 2009"],"Region":"Texas","City":"Victoria","Case Number":"17705","Longitude":"-97.000138","Summary":"Very bright light in sky.","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"28.815237","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-06282009-0009","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
