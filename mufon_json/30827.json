Something in the sky caught my eye. It was a very bright stationary light in the northeastern sky. It sat still for about 30 seconds, then glowed brighter and got bigger. It dropped or ascended and left a slight trail making the whole thing look like a teardrop. I sat on the steps and watched the sky to see if I could see it again. About ten minutes later, in a more northerly direction, I saw the same thing again. It didn't go or travel there. It just appeared and stayed there bigger and brighter than any star. After about 30 to 45 seconds, it got bigger and brighter, then dropped leaving a trail as bright as the original object. The trail was not fainter than the object and it didn't fade out. It actually looked like part of the object more than a trail. When the object disappeared, the entire trail disappeared, too."],"Log Number":"US-08122011-0002","Longitude":"-99.28821","Date Submitted":"08/12/2011 12:50 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Mountain Home","There were no other sightings in Mountain Home on or around August 8th 2011"],"Object Shape":"Teardrop","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30827.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30827.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"2 objects 10 minutes apart/glowed brightly then dropped and left a slight trail","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown"}
