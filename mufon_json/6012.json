When this \"light\" then got more intensive and also acoustic signals were sent, I left the way out of fear and beat a bend to hold the direction further. After approximately one kilometer I then came, onto these meadows on which the three tractors were in a distance from approx. three to four hundred meters with the aliens. There was clear to me, the signals should persuade me of the turning back. Part from the report I have watched the following event on 5-19-1991: I watched a strange nature of another planet in the Champagne between Epernay and Dorman toward 1.00 hours at night. You sat organized on three tractors distributed respectively with respect to sizes. On the first one per 8 of 1.60 m of size, on the second 8 of 1.80 m of size each and on the third tractor 8 extra-planetary living beings of 1.95 m of size each sat. Ours is shape your body very much, very much! similar. Prominent distinctive marks are the lack of the earlobe and side of the nose as well as the reddish head and neck area. The hue of the other body came on violetly, blue, red and skin-colored. As similar as the colors of the rainbow. Particularly striking was, every group was different from the other group in the body form-great, thick, thin, corpulent. The organic appearance is stressed, shall be said the proportions of the individual parts of the body to each other were that way! even. With respect to sizes, form and weight these living beings looked just too \"natural\" so. I left this place and went to the vineyards. A lamp suddenly came on there between the vines in 4 m of distance, otherwise I could recognize nothing. The light dazzled. I stopped and then moved further at the side. The \"lamp\" followed my movement. Hastily I turned round and wanted into contrary to a sedate direction make way. But another lamp was coming on in 10 m of distance at this moment. I stopped, looked around and hurried toward the road lying below the vineyards. A gaseous cloud was rising of a near situated meadow at this moment ���this was the Laser-Sign for the aliens around this area. I marched down now direction road and the vineyard accelerated my operations in the direction of the Dorman. An extra-planetary living being suddenly came at the side from the meadow goose-step-likely -no man can go so or imitate this movement rhythm, from the darkness toward the road and wanted to cut the way off for me. The body color was black like the night and I could do this only thanks to the moonlight. recognize well. I ran as fast as I could and added a bend to some 100 m on the fields. A larger lamp in form of a heart also came on there between the fruit-trees. This one I ran to the river and direction Dorman got bright as fast as I could to it unflustered."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.043411,+3.956242(6012)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6012) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/19/1991 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Champagne-Ardenne","Log Number":"FR-12282006-0002","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"49.043411","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6012.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6012.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"05/19/1991 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"6012","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"ÃÂpernay","Summary":"When penetrating to the inner core of the aliens light signals were sent by you.","Country":"France"}
