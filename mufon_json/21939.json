(i am prior usaf) i asked her what she thought it was and it then quickly gained altitude and shrank in size and brightness and then disapeared from view. the total viewing time was very short at about 1 minute or so."],"Date of the Event":"02/17/2010 12:00 UTC","City":"Portland","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.664001,+-70.248976(21939)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21939) map </A>","Region":"Maine","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02192010-0006","Case Number":"21939","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Portland","There were no other sightings in Portland on or around February 17th 2010"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21939.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21939.html"]}
