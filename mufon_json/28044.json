I noticed on my right basically the Southeast a half disc bright red orange about the speed and altitude of an aircraft moving to the northwest. The object was clear as was the weather and it was not an airplane as there were several other airplanes around clearly visible . This object had no blinking lights and it looked like it was a fireball. after it flew over, it slowly disappeared in the distance, not because of distance, it just evaporated. Three other people saw this, a woman and two children, a boy and a girl about 8-11 years old. The boy became terrified and almost started crying. I am intrigued by this phenomimon and I have not seen one like this before. I was pissed that I did not have a camera or phone handy."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28044.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28044.html"],"Log Number":"US-03012011-0010","Summary":"I saw an orange half disc that looked like it was on fire.","Date Submitted":"03/01/2011 09:02 UTC","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around March 1st 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Dallas","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.804645,+-96.763483(28044)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28044) map </A>"}
