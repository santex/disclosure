THAT NIGHT THE MOON WAS FULL WHICH MADE SEEING THIS HUGE CRAFT VERY EASY. IT CAME FROM THE NORTH HEADING SOUTH TOWARD MEDICINE LAKE CALIFORNIA. I ESTIMATE THAT THE HEIGHT OF THE TREES TO BE AROUND 200 FEET IN THIS AREA MAKING IT EASY TO JUDGE HEIGHT. YOU COULD CLEARLY MAKE OUT THE METALLIC BODY AND SEE LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE WINDOWS. THE SHAPE OF THE CRAFT WAS STRANGE. IT LOOKED LIKE A BUNCH OF SHIPPING CONTAINERS OFFSET FROM ONE ANOTHER AND THE END LOOKED LIKE A GIANT CARPENTERS SQUARE. WE THOUGHT THIS WAS SKYLAB AND NEVER SAID MUCH ABOUT IT UNTIL YEARS LATER WHEN I FIGURED OUT SATELLITES ARE SMALL PIN PRICKS OF LIGHT. RECENTLY, I WAS LOOKING THROUGH UTUBE AND FOUND SOMETHING THAT CO-OBERATES MY STORY, A SIGHTING THAT THREE ASTRONAUTS WITNESSED: A LARGE UFO WHILE IN SKYLAB IN 1973 THEY ESTIMATED THE CRAFT AROUND 800 TO 900 FT."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
