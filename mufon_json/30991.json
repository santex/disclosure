{"Date of the Event":"08/14/2011 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn Sunday August 14 approx 1230-100am we were outside hoping to catch a glimps of a remainder of a meteor showers but did not see any. Then all of a sudden I noticed a circle type objects appear from nowhere moving across the skys and all of a sudden just disappear. This was wierd because the objects were moving from west to east and the area they were in was clear skys . I live in a area were its not uncommon to see planes and their lights but this was no plane and for sure no meteor that I have seen it did not leave a trail of any type. it was clearly two orangish color cicle objects at a high rate of spee... I yelled to my friend and pointed in the direction and when they were trying to see what I pointed at they disappeared in a clear sky. weird. I will never see something like this again."],"Log Number":"US-08182011-0019","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30991.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30991.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.961682,+-85.645302(30991)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30991) map </A>","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.961682","Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Grand Rapids","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were no other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around August 14th 2011"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/18/2011 04:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Observed 2 circle type objects appear from nowhere and travelled and gone in less than 5 seconds","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.645302","Case Number":"30991","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
