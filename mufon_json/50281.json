{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was at about 500ft at an unknown distance (maybe 50-100 miles, we are unsure). Another friend texted saying they could see it from Alton, Hampshire which is 100 miles away and a 2 and a half hour drive. It was flashing red green and white very quickly. A plane flew past during the sighting but the object was still in the same place and never moved, definetly not a plane or helicopter."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.127889,+-3.003632(50281)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50281) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50281.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50281.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/29/2013 06:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"50281","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"51.127889","Longitude":"-3.003632","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"England","Country":"United Kingdom","City":"Bridgwater","Summary":"red, green and white flashing lights.","Date of the Event":"08/29/2013 10:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"GB-08292013-0027","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bridgwater","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
