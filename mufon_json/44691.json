These lights were seen by my daughter (an adult) around 10:15 p.m. last night (December 19, 2012.) My daughter had gone outside to her car parked in the driveway to recharge her phone battery (she had left her regular charger at work.) She was just sitting in the car and looking out the window when she noticed a total of 6 or 7 bright orange round objects in the sky. I believe she told me they were ALL orange but for some reason some of them appeared white in photos provided. She tells me there was no sound. She reported it to 911 non-emergency.....No drinking was involved in this siting :) Wish I had more precise information. I will forward the link of this site to my daughter, perhaps she has more details she can add. I would love to know if anyone else in Charlotte NC has seen what she has. Thank you."]}
