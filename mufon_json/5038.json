I get up to close the window, and I look out the window and see what appears to be a blimp floating about 300 - 400 feet above the buildings 1-2 blocks away. about the size of a cue ball in my view. my 1st reaction was \" what are these guys crazy?, flying this low in brooklyn?, i hope they are ok\" about 5 seconds later, it was slowly heading in my direction and thats when i got a real good look at it and said to myself i can't be seeing this! i saw what appeared to be a stingray fish looking blimp! it was porclin white with a bright orange boarder, like a decal or some kind of sticker boarder. a light glowing reddish orange mist? around the ship and a metallic looking ball (orb)in the center. it was floating so gracefully, like it didnt have a care in the world. it truly was a beautiful craft. as it got a little closer i noticed it was moving back and forth, in lets say feet to where it was. and out from my right a dark small storm cloud about the size of the craft, came towards the craft fast and within approx 50 feet, a thick bluish orange bolt came out and hit the metal orb and it made a bright flash and just dissapeared! at that point i jumped back thinking that the craft has just expolded, expecting parts to be all over the streets below. after i kept looking and seen no trace of it, thats when i realized it just vanished from my point of view. right before the cloud came in, it acted like it was waiting for the bolt or like fine tuning a radio station. or like harpooning a fish. when the bolt hit, it made a hollow bursting sound. at that point i started to freak out knowing that what i just saw was real and i was not just seeing lights in the sky. i mean it was daylight out and right in front of my eyes! my girlfriend jumps out of bed from her relaxed state, sees me shaking and repeating myself over and over again \"oh my god!\" she says i am scaring her and what was that sound? i thought she was asleep and when she said that, i felt somewhat relieved knowing that atleast she heard that! i told her that i just seen a ufo and it just vanished and the sound she heard was it getting hit by a bolt of lightning! she calmed me down and she looked worried knowing me for 12 years never seen me so dumbfounded. I was in complete shock. always imagined it would be an experience at night, all the way up in the sky, with blinking colored lights like everyone always describes. never would i have thought it would be like this!!! i figured someone else had to have seen it. so around 10 pm after i somewhat calmed down, i am on my way to the pizzaria and i see in the sky above my head, in front of my building about 800 - 1000 ft 1 white orb flying by fast but smooth. following it was 1 black orb and 2 more white orbs in a triangle formation. at this point i am really starting to hit a point where i felt like i was dreaming or in a twilight zone and this was not happening. i mean 2 encounters in 1 evening? i felt like if next they were gonna land and it would be all over the news! seemed like there must have been up there all night. so i walk fast to the pizzaria to see a friend who works there and quietly asked him, if he hears of any stories of a craft above the buildings to let me know. he freaked out and told me to tell his co workers. when i did they looked at him with eyes wide! he told me that a week prior in bensonhurst, he seen the same exact craft i seen and described it exactly. says he got abused by his co workers telling him if et comes tell him we give him a free pie on the house! ridiculed all week long. now we were like little kids telling our story back and forth with relief and excietment. he also mentioned a close encounter when he lived in italy both he and his brother had. where they both seen a triangle craft. but he heard a noise and his brother didnot. this seemed to bother him. says it so confused. but we both felt a huge relief that we actually seen the same craft and no longer will he be made fun of! says no one believed him. i told him that i wouldnt have either! until that 25 second time of my life i was a skeptic. i did research on google to find that brooklyn is a hotbed for ufo activity. never would i have thought that such a populated area would be so happening with ufo activity. i cant stop looking out my window thinking i will see another ufo again. everywhere i go, i look up. hopeing i will see another to show people, and maybe someone in her neighborhood will see me and figure out why i am looking up. i don't want to ask anyone, thinking everyone will think i am crazy or on drugs. i also called 9-11 asking if anything was reported? nothing, so i asked them to report this. her tone of voice was like, go to bed. it has been about a week now and my girlfriend says i am obsessing over this. i can't help but be totally wanting answers that i know i wont get. strange how basically a 25 sec exp could change your life in a strange way! also note that the sunday it happened, most people in that neighborhood went away for 4th of july weekend, which cut the number of witnesses probably in half. but i still feel someone had to have seen it as well. there are still alot of people around where it was floating. i don't know what to make of this. but i do know what i saw, and will never forget that day. and the moment plays in my mind like a broken record. from that day on, i will always be a skywatcher!"],"Longitude":"-73.997453","Country":"United States","Case Number":"5038","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-07092006-0001","Region":"New York","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.724223,+-73.997453(5038)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5038) map </A>","City":"New York","Date of the Event":"07/02/2006 07:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Blimp, Triangle, Other","Summary":"beautiful porclin white craft floats above bayridge brooklyn buildings in daylight!"}
