So I pulled over to film it. Then the cloud started to push down like something was weighing it down. I thought it could be a UFO, but i was scared to find out. As I made my video, I said 2012 thet are here. And something said to me, we have all ways been here. I looked around, and there was no one. I don't want to sound crazy, but something talked to me that day.I pulled off and for the last 9 months I can feel things I can't explain."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43870.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43870.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.618788,+-84.451764(43870)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43870) map </A>","Latitude":"33.618788","Tags":"City"}
