As soon as I stepped out the door I looked up and pointed to my friend and said what the hell is that? My friend said that its prolly a ufo and laughed, the object was bright white towards the center with red, blue light pulsating from the center. The object remained visible for about 2 minutes then just vanished like someone turning out a light switch. It was not a air plane as we could see planes flying high above in the skies. The object was around 35 degrees in the air towards the south west of Republic, MO. I would estimate that the object from my viewing point was the size of a half dollar. Hwy 60 west and east run right where this object was and traffic could be heard from the location of my home so someone else had to of seen this it was out of place in the night sky at 8:33pm."],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Summary":"Pulsating lights with center of object being extremely bright white","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
