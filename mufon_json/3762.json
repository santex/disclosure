They were talking and I was sitting in the back seat, with my two sisters in the rear of the station wagon asleep. I was sitting up and leaning over the front seat staring out the windshield at the bright stars, hoping to catch a glance of a shooting star. I saw a very bright blinking light directly above us following the highway and moving in a very fast zig zag fashion. I pointed it out to my Mom and her friend and we watched it for what seemed to be a long time. The three of us were trying to figure out what it could be and decided it was definately a UFO. The object ended up travelling much faster than us and it flew off into the night. We ended up pulling over at a truck stop to see if there were other witnesses, but no one appeared to be talking about it and we certainly didn't bring it up. It couldn't have been an airplane because there were no red and green flashing lights associated with it."],"Date of the Event":"07/31/1976 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
