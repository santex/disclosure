I thought I was seeing an airplane with sunlight reflecting off it, because of the pale orange color, but before I had time to see if it was moving, it disappeared. There were no clouds in the sky in that area. I have seen one or two similar objects in the same place on three other occasions in the past month: at dusk, two bright stars to the right of Jupiter that disappeared within a few seconds of spotting them; one star at dusk; and one other sighting in early morning. They don't seem to be moving and resemble a bright star or planet, a bit smaller and brighter than Jupiter. The first time I saw this, I assumed I was seeing a plane go behind a cloud (even though there were no noticeable clouds) and I watched to see if it would reappear, but it didn't. I'm watching that part of the sky now, especially after so many similar reports from around the country."],"Latitude":"32.3222","Object Features":"Unknown"}
