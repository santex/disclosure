We were surprized and didn't know what to think. The objects were one long, about 7 or8 feet long bright white line in the sky with 2 orange pink misshapen circular objects on the side of the line. They didn't move for about an hour just stayed the same. We had gone in and out of the house twice and they were still there in the same place when we came back out each time. Some very light clounds passed over the objects but you could still see them through the clouds.The last time we came out of the house to look they were gone.The pink orangeobjects were glowy. Thank you for your time. I was hoping you could have an idea what they were.
