I looked up towards the northeast to see if any stars were visible. What I saw threw that thought out of my mind. My mom had been looking in the same direction for about 4-5 minutes, saying, \"that is a weird plane!\" When I looked, I saw the same exact thing that I saw on the 4th of July last year (2012). A red light. This time, I had binoculars with me. I looked through the binoculars and saw a bell shaped object that was emitting a bright red light. I handed over the binoculars to my Mom, who noticed that it had began to rotate. As we watched (there was 5 different people who saw it) the light rotated to the opposite side of the bell. It rotated completely around three times, then just blinked out of existence. The five of us looked at each other, and just were blown away by what we had just witnessed."],"Case Number":"48488"}
