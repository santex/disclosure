I could make out most of the outline against the clouds and it was not shaped like any aircraft I have seen. I watched it as I drove into the neighborhood and as I pulled up to the house I was delivering to. I went to grab my iPod to take a picture but when I turned around it was gone. I brought it up to some open minded friends of mine and one of them stated that they have seen similar objects around the same area on different dates."],"Region":"Michigan","Log Number":"US-09112011-0019","Longitude":"-83.477036","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.313494,+-83.477036(31749)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31749) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"31749","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/11/2011 05:15 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/09/2011 08:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.313494","Summary":"Triangular craft w bright white lites on corners"}
