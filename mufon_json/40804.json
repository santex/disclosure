I was in Grundy Center and it was NE in the distance. I was watching the clouds coming in from the north. Noticed a shining metal sphere appeared bright silver and pivoted at times and appeared solid black then pivoted again and silver. Hovered in place with eventual slight movement east and hovered more then disappeared into clouds after I watched for about 10 minutes.
