It then looked like a bird to me at first then it looked like balloons and then it got closer, I could see what it was, it looked gun black, about 10 ft round and 6 to 8 ft tall. It looked like a thread bobbing, it flew across the sky, the same speed and until it went out of my sight. It took about 30 seconds to go from left to right, absolutely no noise, it blew my mind. I could not believe I saw that in the sky. I live 2 miles from FAA center in New Jersey. I have seen every plane that the air force has flown over my house, it was not a plane."],"Longitude":"-74.400991","Region":"New Jersey","Country":"United States","Summary":"Flew across the sky right in front me 200 or 300 feet up."}
