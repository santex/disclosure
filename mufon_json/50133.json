My backyard lawn has a discoloration , that is in the form of a circle. The grass appears to be burnt, yet if you reach down and pull the grass out, it has a sooty film on it,very compareable to charcoal ashes. Yet the blade of grass is still green and hydrated beneath this sooty film. I googled ,,,lawn rings,grass circles, etc...closest thing I found was something referred to as \"lawn faires, which is a fungal infection in the grass which kills down to the root....nothing matches. I estimate the diameter of the ring to be 10 ft in diameter. Enlighten me peoples ! Could be nothing....but I can't find anything like it on the internet .? P.S..nice screening process....just kidding,that sucked."],"Viewing Distance":"N/A","Longitude":"-84.261388","Summary":"na","Log Number":"US-08242013-0030","trends":[],"Sighting Duration":"02:07:20","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/24/2013 02:16 UTC"}
