(ok, so a lifelong knowledge of ufos has made me a little paranoid. i had a daytime sighting in 1961, when i was 11 with 2 hours of missing time.) i sat down and typed a few words. my dogs started barking, i let them outside, noting that the clock above the door said 10:33, and i sit back down at the computer, but the barking persists and seems to beckon me outside. it was chilly in n florida, 54 degrees, so i put on a sweater and ran outside to see what they were barking so incessantly at. i went outside and stood on the porch and looked up. there was a white light blinking intermittently and after about 10 seconds changing to a triangle with a light on each corner, red, green, white. the single white light flashing light at the beginning of the sighting was about the size of 4 stars together and the triangle it turned into, the sides were as long as two aspirins at arms length it was intermittent red, green, white, flash...flash������. .flash flash flash flash.. flash (estimation, not exact sequence) and not regular, the time between the flashes was not the same each time. the lights were beautiful. it danced around the sky and i said to it ���hey, wanna take me for a ride? come get me, only this time i want to remember!��� i watched it dance around. for a minute or two it blinked here and then there, like the cheshire cat in the right hand quadrant of my area of view. then it went to the left and stopped and zig-zagged. it blinked out and then reappeared a few times. it flew to the left a few inches in the sky. at one point the triangle looked like the edges were lit up, pale yellow lines were visible on two sides, and it seemed to have an ultraviolet glow. then, it flew out of sight to the left, traveling about a foot at arms length, across the sky. as it disappeared behind the trees i sang ���hey, mr. spaceman���, (mcguinn). i continued to stare at the sky hoping it would re-appear. just to the left of the tree line, flash���flash. large white blobs of cohesive light about aspirin size at an arm���s length and about an inch apart at an arms length. the flashes were a couple of seconds apart bright white, except there were no rays of light coming from them. that���s why i call them cohesive light. and, the strangest thing, they were blobs, not round. they were unevenly shaped and the two were not identical. after the white flashes, which lasted maybe 5 seconds, they winked out at the same moment, a plane flew in the same direction. i could hear the plane. the ufo was silent. i went back inside to write about it and looked at the clock on the computer- 11:20. i didn���t realize until i had written for about an hour and it and it was 12:30 that i had probably had some missing time; not that that matters. (lea hayley had an experience once where they brought her back a few minutes before she last looked at the clock.) i figured that the sighting lasted maybe 10 minutes but not the 45 minutes that passed. i know i should have run back inside my house to grab my camera and my watch but i was too excited to think of that. i should have counted seconds and numbers of flashes and paid attention when the triangle was heading in one direction as to which color light was the leading one, but i didn't think about it until the sighting was over. i have not yet drawn any pictures. i did not have my glasses on."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"6515","Object Shape":"Flash, Triangle, Other","Longitude":"-82.314936","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6515.html"],"Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Gainesville","There were no other sightings in Gainesville on or around February 20th 2007"],"Date of the Event":"02/20/2007 10:33 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.659874,+-82.314936(6515)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6515) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03072007-0004","Summary":"Flashing white light then triangle shaped craft with 3 lights- red, green and white"}
