I walked out before she did and noticed what seemed to be a plane or helicopter in the near distance. The light that was emitted was steady unlike the blinking of a star. AS I tried to stare at the object I begin to feel like I was seeing something that I wasn't and as I stared my vision began to blur. I called my gf to look and she said the same thing that it blurred her vision to look. It just hovered there as a matter of fact it is hovering there as I type. While we looked the object dimmed slightly and then seemed to give off much stronger rays of light directly over top of the sphere. We both felt that this was weird.. My gf asked could it be the north star? But NO it was in the southern sky. I am still watching this object to see if it leaves or stays....."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.706522,+-81.218693(17682)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17682) map </A>","Summary":"Sitting too close to be a star and never \"blinking\" like a star is supposed to the object was very difficult to stare directly at.
