this bothered me all day, it is too strange, not to question, doesn't make any logical sense it doesn't fit in to any thing i have seen..i see large and small aircraft of all kinds day and night in the skies above and around the area. i live close to a small airport, 50 miles or less from major airports, major army, air force, and navy military bases..the description of this object is very very close to the description of \"event 20115\" for 10\\25\\09 in austin tx, very strange, it seems like he\\she is describing almost exactly what i watched, what are the odds????...how could i be the only person in this region to see this event it went on long enough for many people to see, but you would have to be a sky watcher, which most people rarely bother to look at anymore..."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Washington","Latitude":"47.014559","Date of the Event":"10/24/2009 11:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"20134","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.014559,+-122.904766(20134)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20134) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Brilliant Ruby Red Object below tree line south, moved West behind trees, then East in site, erratic slow moving..","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.904766","Log Number":"US-10262009-0003","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Tumwater","There were no other sightings in Tumwater on or around October 24th 2009"],"City":"Tumwater","Object Shape":"Diamond, Sphere, Star-like","Source":"MUFON"}
