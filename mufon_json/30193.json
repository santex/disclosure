Then i realized that it had green lights, not red. I wanted to see what it was so I got a pair of binoculars. I was shocked to see an object that was either very dark gray or black and was sort of saucer like only more angular with the top and bottom portions flattened off rather than rounded.It had one green light that I could see and it was located at the point where the top and bottom parts of the craft met. There were no windows or anything that I could see. It seemed solid. After a few seconds, I lost sight of it so I dropped the binoculars to try to get a fix on it's location, but it was gone. No sign of it anywhere in the sky.When I had it in view in the binoculars, it filled the entire field of vision, but I think it must not have been very large because they were my birdwatching binoculars which are not very powerful. This sighting has left me very unsettled. It was a very disturbing thing to see and I can't stop thinking about it. I have to find out what that thing was. I thought it might have been a remote control toy or something, but I searched the internet and couldn't find one like it. Then I searched UFO drone craft and couldn't find anything like it there either. If you have any idea what it might have been, I am very interested in knowing. It will drive me nuts until I have an answer. Thank you."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Saw what I thought was a plane but it had green lights not red.
