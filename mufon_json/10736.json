The Circle was moving very slow from North to South. Altitude no more than 300 meters High. At the time I could not connect the circle to anything that I knew, but at the some time I did not related to anything strange rather then I could not come up with an Explanation for it. I am reporting it now only because I Found several other pictures of similar circles and at least a couple of movie clips from different internet sites. I made two short video clips, one when I got off the car and while walking towards the Supermarket, and another when I got to the corner of the super market. Both Movie clips and Google View are Attached.
