I was just sitting down in the dark trying to cool off. I looked at the time, the time was approximately 12:00am. I was about to go to sleep on the couch. As soon as i went to lie down I saw two bright lights. I ignored it for a few minutes just realizing the lights were not normal. The lights in the sky were the same size as the sun. No airplane or helicopter could have a bright light like what I witnessed. It looked like a massive star continuously glowing. The colours of the bright lights were yellow when i was looking at it. I felt happy and calm and my eyes wanted to blink but I was amazed so much. All thoughts in my head eventually went away. When the two UFO's turned towards the city the shape was a silhouette of half a circle. Then they were traveling faster than any object I saw in my life. I just lost sight of them when were heading towards the city. (I'm sorry if i don't have a recording, i was just more amazed with the UFO more than my mobile phone)"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19263.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19263.html"],"Longitude":"144.9664","Object Flight Path":"Other,Unknown","Latitude":"-37.810247","City":"Melbourne","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Australia","Date of the Event":"12/31/2007 12:00 UTC","Region":"Victoria","Object Features":"Other","Case Number":"19263","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-37.810247,+144.9664(19263)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19263) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/12/2009 09:36 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Two UFO's witnessed at night near Melbourne city"}
