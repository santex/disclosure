At first I didn't think much of it and I continued my star gazing. Then I noticed the same blinking light in the exact same place about a minute or so later. I've seen satalites, the I.S.S. etc passing over and I've even noticed occasional \"flashes\" of light from these which I assume is related to the rotation of mirrors or something catching the sun's rays. This incident is different. I continued to watch the light blink on and off every minute or a bit longer continually for an hour, and always in the same spot in the clear nite sky. I imagine it's still doing so even as I write this. Can you tell me if there is any type of natural or man made phenominon that can occur in this fashion? It's got me curious as all get out!"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in State College","There were no other sightings in State College on or around May 9th 2010"],"Date Submitted":"05/09/2010 10:32 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"23213","Object Features":"Unknown"}
