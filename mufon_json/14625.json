{"Tags":"City","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"12/29/2008 09:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI have arrived home helping my brother move. I looked up at the sky and an airplane was cerculating a area of Sacramento continuesly. No lights were as if to look for sombody, except the blinking lights, so I know it was not from the police. No helecopters circulating that area. Out of the blue 3 or more of the same planes were circulating other parts of Sacramento, and It seemed them like they were looking for somthing. The same exact look alike planes from what it seemed. I heard a few years back that Sacramento could used as a pretext to invade Iran either by launching a device in it or somthing else, and blaming Iran for a attack on US. So I belive the Surveillance is to prepare an area for such thing, but this is just my opinion. Somthing seriously is going on in Sacramento, becasue this is the second time I see this thing going on this year. No police planes of helecopters, but Surveillance planes in particular areas. There is either one or more planes at one time. Without any light on circulating an area around Sacramento. Somthing very suspicously always comes up when I see those planes like somthing is about ot happen over Sacramento. I asked my sister in law what those planes were and she didnt know. So that would be the only witness I have."],"Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Airplane Surveillance of Sacramento","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.963372,+-121.28478(14625)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14625) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-121.28478","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14625.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14625.html"],"trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Stockton","There was one other sighting in Stockton on or around December 29th 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"37.963372","Log Number":"US-12302008-0011","Date Submitted":"12/29/2008 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Stockton","Case Number":"14625"}
