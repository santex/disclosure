I looked to the northwest and saw the contrails of a jet going east. As I followed the jet, which was well over 10000 feet in altitude, and I noticed a bright, starlike light moving toward it moving southwest. I thought that there would be a mid air collision. I could make out the details of the jet, but the object was as bright as a star. It crossed behind the jets pAth and seemed to slow speed to almost a hover. It then moved very slow westerly and stopped, then the brightness faded to nothing. I tried to point it out to my wife, but she could not see it, as she is blind in one eye and has poor vision. I was not frightenned, just amazed."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Iowa","Latitude":"41.640613","City":"Harlan","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Bright light","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47969.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47969.html"]}
