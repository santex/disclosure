It was dark outside and for some reason I was admiring the stars in the clear night sky. I was looking in one patch of sky to the WSW where there was nothing visible(don't know why I was looking at that spot) and suddenly a very bright object appeared at approximately 75 degrees. It was twice as bright as Venus and five times as large. It looked like something had just been sitting there, then flashed its lights on and off just to let me know that they were there. After that I drove home and later on - around 8:30 PM another object appeared in the same manner in the North sky at about 75 degrees. This time, it moved North very quickly and out of sight, leaving a trail of light behind it. That sighting lasted approximately four seconds. Note: See the CMS database for another sighting that was reported by three other witnesses at approximately the same time as this one. It may be the same object. I am the assistant state director - you don't need to assign this to anyone."],"Summary":"Very bright UFO appeared, then vanished","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20358.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20358.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/07/2009 11:13 UTC","Longitude":"-94.413647","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There was one other sighting in Independence on or around November 6th 2009"],"Case Number":"20358","Date of the Event":"11/06/2009 06:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Missouri"}
