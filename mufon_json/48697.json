It was suggested that it could have been a hot air balloon that was lit on fire for the 4th, but it seemed to go too fast for that and showed up three different times in the course of two hours. It looked like a flaming or glowing orange ball that rapidly flew across the sky, sometimes becoming very bright. The last time it flew straight over the top of us, and didn't appear to be very high. There was at least ten of us that saw it at the party."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07052013-0072","Case Number":"48697","Longitude":"-114.337633","Country":"United States","Summary":"Orange orb that would light up then fade away traveling fairly fast","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 12:00 UTC"}
