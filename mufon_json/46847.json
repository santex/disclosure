Orange flashing light approx.4 miles away appearing the size of a half dollar followed by a tiny one with no flashing. Heading from west to east and then South towards Seattle. TONS of visuals going on AND I have been informed of some very suspicious activity at the BOING facility about a mile from my home. As a matter of fact ... call me for a new project the govt. and BOING seems to be working with each other on here. My friends and I have viewed a NEW type of craft that we havent heard anyone mention yet.Lots of us have seen these objects. You won't believe it! Sincerely, Robert P.S. Please keep my involvment quiet. I am truly afraid of what my govt. would do to keep all of this quiet. Thanks again. ~B~"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Summary":"several witnesses, many different nights, please writeor call for details"}
