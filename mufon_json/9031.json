{"Longitude":"-96.325977","divs":["Sighting Detailsdriving home from the grocery store I looked up at the sky and saw 3 comet looking things, I commented to my son they looked like comets, but they were going in a horizontal line at 3 different altitudes, not falling and by the time we got home they were gone. He said maybe falling stars, but it wasn't the same. I joked and said maybe they were UFO's, but after seeing the report on Larry King maybe it wasn't a joke. I thought maybe airplanes, but I am a Flight Attendant and have never seen any aircraft look like this or with the bright lighting at the one end like this, nor fly at that altitude with those characteristics?"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9031.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9031.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","Summary":"3 comet looking things going horizontal","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in College Station","There were no other sightings in College Station on or around January 10th 2008"],"Latitude":"30.635137","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/10/2008 06:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.635137,+-96.325977(9031)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9031) map </A>","City":"College Station","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"9031","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/10/2008 06:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-01192008-0001"}
