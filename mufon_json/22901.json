(if you would like to see video i only have it on an analogue video tape. my digital camera would have never been able to catch sight of it.)"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.43305","Summary":"A White ball of light with red & bluish green light rotating around it in the western sky seen on 2 nights (4/11 & 4/13).","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22901.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22901.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"04/11/2010 10:02 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.43305,+-111.935975(22901)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22901) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-111.935975","City":"Tempe","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"04/20/2010 01:11 UTC","Case Number":"22901","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04202010-0002"}
