I take pictures and star watch often. While taking pictures of the moon after 1 am i caught a light in my pics that i knew immediately to be something strange. I just held still in excitement and awe and just kept clicking. As quick as i seen it it disappeared on me. The whole thing lasted seconds. I dont think it went away. I think the light it was emitting (red) just stopped. I would be interested to see if maybe it is in the rest of my pics. I havent altered them in any way. I dont want to play with contrast or anything on them till they are properly examined."],"Case Number":"37985","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Tallmadge","There were 2 other sightings in Tallmadge on or around May 6th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.091058","Longitude":"-81.415564","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"light around moon then changed direction flew then disappeared","City":"Tallmadge","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"05/06/2012 01:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37985.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37985_submitter_file1__DSCN1307.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37985_submitter_file2__DSCN1308.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37985_submitter_file3__DSCN1309.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37985.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/07/2012 12:58 UTC"}
