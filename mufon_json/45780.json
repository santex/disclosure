As we came over the hill prior to the bridge over lone star lake, we saw straight ahead an red orange glow in the sky just above the clouds. This was a huge glow. Our first thought was a house fire or something of the sort. So we immediately turned off the highway and drove towards the light, only the further we drove west to it the farther west it would get from us. about 15 min later it just whooshed up and away into the clouds. We were baffled by the experience and I still would like to know what it was over Jenkins, Texas."],"Longitude":"-94.723078","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/18/2013 10:58 UTC"}
