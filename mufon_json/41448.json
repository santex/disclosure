At tfirst he thought it was a plane but the lights didnt blink properly or were the right color. Then the object began to move very fast in random directions. It also seemed to have a few followers off in the distanced. It flash blue and purple and was a steady white. So he came inside to get me and we got the digital camera we took some really weird looking pictures and when we zoomed in we realized it was 3 lights in a triangle shape. I thought how cool is this I had the chills and he thought of everything he could to dismiss but the movement was to erratic to be an aircraft. The other 2 lights off to the left just zoomed off and dissappeared. After watching for about 45 mins and getting photos and a minute video we decide to go back inside and see if it was there they next night and it has not been back since. I have tried to zoom on my pictures and get a better look but I dont think I have the software capable of enhancing something so far away."],"Summary":"Bright Light Purple and Blue lights","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
