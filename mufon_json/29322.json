It was at a pretty good altitude and it was hauling. I ran in the breezeway and yelled to my girl to grab the camera. By the time I got back outside to photograph the object. I have the pic, it's not the best but when photographed it appeared whitish and not metallic I'm not saying it was a UFO for sure but I'm 39 years old and have never seen anything like it. Just want to reporte it because it was strange and I'm a beleiver and just feel in my gut it was something that was not of this planet. There was no contrail at all !! Very odd folks, very odd. For whatever reason your sites not allowing me to post a picture but I do have one."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Greenwich","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"29322","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29322.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29322.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.090632,+-73.498725(29322)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29322) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
