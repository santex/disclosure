Went out on my front porch for a smoke last night around 9:15 PM. The air felt wierd, but it was very calm and quite. About 9:20 PM loud hum began and the neighborhood dogs began to bark. There was then a flash of bright light above me and to my left. I was facing and looking east. I looked up and saw a slow moving, very bright light that turned yellow, then blinked a couple of times before turning orange. Followed it for about 5 to 10 seconds before it turned north and disappeared or excelerated upward at a very high speed. It semed to blend in with the stars. Afterwards and today I am feeling very energized."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"29.768353","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.768353,+-95.36591(11981)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11981) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-95.36591","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like"}
