The night was very clear and the moon and the large planet that is near it were very visible. I noticed a star like object with the same white color and size of a small to medium star moving across the atmosphere. very high up in the sky. It moved west to east across the sky in a straight line. very near the speed of a commercial jetliner. I found out from afriend that you cannot see a sattelite without a telescope. Is this true? Could have been of human origins. (experimental or something already in service.)Ther were no blinking lights, just white and steady. If they were e.t.s they were just cruising along. a person would really have to be concentrating on the sky to have seen this. I have seen ufo's in the past similar to this. If they are real I hope they will help us with our problems."],"Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"05/19/2007 10:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"7057","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/19/2007 10:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05212007-0003","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Mobile","There were no other sightings in Mobile on or around May 19th 2007"],"Region":"Alabama","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7057.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7057.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-88.033504","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
