While driving on Harlansburg Rd (into Croton), a bright green light caught both of our eyes. It was to our right seemingly way out over a field. It basically looked like a shooting star but it seemed to come out of nowhere and it fell straight down. Now I've seen shooting stars and am always watching the sky, and I have NEVER seen a green shooting star that zips straight down. We actually pulled over expecting to hear an explosion or see some kind of commotion in the area where it seemed to hit but nothing happened. I've been seeing strange things in the area since last summer and am wondering if anyone else has or if I've officially lost it."],"Latitude":"41.010982","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03202012-0003","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.010982,+-80.345289(36601)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36601) map </A>","Summary":"Green Shooting Star-Like Object Falls Straight Down","Case Number":"36601","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in New Castle","There was one other sighting in New Castle on or around December 8th 2011"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/20/2012 12:43 UTC","Date of the Event":"12/08/2011 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36601.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36601.html"]}
