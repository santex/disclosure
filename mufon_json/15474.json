I often go outside to smoke. I will often look into the night sky. Whatever star is in SW sky is bright this time of year. It is just below the moon. And that is when i noticed the object. It was not immediate, but I did see a flash of light. It only flashed once, but I could see what I think to be an outline of an object. The position the object was at the moon's 4-5 o'clock. It was very small. Just a pin prick of light. I have seen satellites before in the night sky, but this was not a streak of light across the sky. I noticed the flash first. And when it had my full attention, I could see it move for a split second. I scanned the sky around the moon to see if I could pick it up again. I am reporting this as a UFO event because I can find no other explanation on the internet. Not sure what it was."],"Region":"Kansas","Object Shape":"Flash, Unknown","Case Number":"15474","Log Number":"US-02132009-0008","City":"Dodge City","Date of the Event":"02/02/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
