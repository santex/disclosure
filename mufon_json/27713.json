I stopped to adjust my ipod and some movement in the sky caught my eye. I looked up and saw an object moving. At first I thought it was a cloud or flock of geese. The object was flying from south to north. The object had no lights, sound, or contrails. It moved at a rapid speed and was barely noticeable. It almost seemed like it was cloaked in a cloud or fog but the skies were clear. I could only see the shape of it because it blocked out the sky as it flew over head. It wasn't very high in the sky at all. I lost sight of it behind some trees but I ran around the trees only to see the back of it as it flew away north. My heart was pounding so rapidly after this event. I assure you it was not a plane, chopper, glider, or any other type of craft I have ever seen. It was a small craft and I doubt more than two adults could fit in it. Since 2009 there have been many strange sightings in the skies around Mendocino and Sonoma Counties in Northern California but people are too embarrassed to report them."],"trends":[],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27713.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27713.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.784131","Region":"California","Country":"United States"}
