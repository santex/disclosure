No sound and hauling a**. Went out on the south facing deck to smoke a butt. My wife was there first and taps me on the thigh and says \"there's another one\". Pointing to the southwest. A large white \"ball\" about 1.5 to 2 times the size of jupiter is making a ESE trajectory and hauling the usual a** (note the headline). The duration of sight by both of us was around 15 seconds and covered a little more than a third of the horizon, only to be lost in the treeline of our yard (probably a 38 degree pitch looking due south). We were so disappointed that we do not have a digital camera to record this. Doesn't happen all the time, but it is seen enough... and not just 1. Plus the speed is such that one would have to be up on it instantly with the camera because of the speed."],"Latitude":"45.067375","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Region":"Wisconsin","Date of the Event":"05/14/2010 09:08 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","City":"chippewa","Longitude":"-91.292467"}
