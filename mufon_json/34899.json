It was brighter than any stars or planes in the area. I called my wife and we watched it for about 10 minutes before grabbing our cameras. We ended up watching the object and taking pictures for about 40 minutes or so. We live close to the ATL international airport and several times planes were pretty close to the object. After looking at our pictures and video we noticed the object was disc shaped. At the time the object appeared to change shape. Around 7:40pm the object dimmed and slowly moved out of site. It was a very interesting experience. We aren���t sure what we saw��� We love going to air shows and are used to the air traffic in the area. This was definitely out of the ordinary. I used a Canon 50D and my wife used a Nikon D90"],"Case Number":"34899","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Tyrone","Latitude":"33.465841","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34899.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34899_submitter_file1__9411-ufo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34899_submitter_file2__IMG_9398.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34899_submitter_file3__91417-ufoandsnip.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34899.html"],"Summary":"Disc like object observed in the sky for about 40 minutes before dimming and leaving the distance."}
