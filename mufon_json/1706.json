Was looking up to monitor stack emmissions for workand noticed the object tracking south to north. Noticed unusual colors, nowings, tail or fusilage and moving very slowly. It looked like a multifacetedprism surrounded by a bubble. As I watched it moving north, it suddenly made a90 degree turn east without decelerating as if on an electrical grid. Objecttracked west approximately 30 seconds and stopped completely. It hovered forabout 15 seconds and shot off in a southeasterly direction at an incredible rateof speed. This led me to believe that this was not a manned craft. Also theflight dynamics were like nothing I had observed before given my militarybackground."],"City":"Jacksonville","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"30.333884","Case Number":"1706","Summary":"Saw a metallic ball eminating multiple colors at d","Longitude":"-81.645781","Date Submitted":"06/17/1997 12:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1706.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1706.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/17/1997 12:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 66 other sightings in Jacksonville","There were no other sightings in Jacksonville on or around June 17th 1997"]}
