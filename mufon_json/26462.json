{"Date Submitted":"11/09/2010 01:15 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMalibu Ca. - My girlfriend and I were sitting out on our deck watching \"Lost\" on my laptop when we spotted an extraordinarily bright object about 25 feet to our right slowly meandering down the road in a straight line, neither moving up or down, left or right. The object was about two stories off the ground (about 10 feet over our heads). It made no sound at all and seemed to be nothing more then a bright light. After about 15 seconds it emitted a orange flash from it's \"back\" side (the side opposite it's traveling direction) and took off in the same direction at incredibly fast speeds. Unfortunately there were tree's obstructing our view so I had to jump up on the railing to try to get a better look but by then it was out of sight. Due to the fact that it was so close to us, made no sound at all and had no visible physical shape we were both at a loss to explain the sighting other then as a UFO. If anyone else has seen this please post something about it because we are both very curious to get to the bottom of the sighting. Thank you!
