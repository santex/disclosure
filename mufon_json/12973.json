I glanced up to the sky in the West, and (I'm still shaking, I was so excited) observed a huge silver cylinderical ship slowly gliding toward the north that looked somewhat like a huge jumbo jet with no tail, no wings, and no sound! I watched for about 5 minutes (making a total fool of myself, I'm sure, standing there looking up toward the object in full view of the public) as it descended behind the trees headed northward, when my view became obscured. I got into the car and headed toward home, just 4 or 5 blocks from the school, where I observed several people getting in a stationwagon and 4 workmen (building a house), looking upward and pointing to the sky. I'm reasonably sure they saw the ship also. May I assure you that I am of sound mind, a grandmother of normal intelligence, and an unidentified object was the absolute LAST thing on my mind when I observed this incident."],"Latitude":"36.06672","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Arkansas"}
