Then I realized it was blinking or flashing so it could not have been a star. Then I thought to myself that it must be a plane, so I watched it for about 15 or 20 minutes slowly move west then out of site. I believe if it had been a plane it would have moved away much more quickly than it did. What got my attention is the way the lights were flashing. They looked more like a Christmas tree flashing off and on than a plane, which usually has a distinct green or red light with another strobe light flashing. This did not have that at all. And it was moving way too slow. Very strange."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Houston","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32296.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32296.html"],"Summary":"I saw what I thought at first was a star, then noticed it was flashing.
