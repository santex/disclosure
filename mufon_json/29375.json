I noticed an object moving through the stars that I thought was a sattelite at first. It was a little bit brighter and it had no tail like a comet would. It was moving very strangley. It would pulse forward a very noticeable distantce instantly. I watched this small, star-like object pulse more frequently until there was a sudden, giant, bright light like an explosion and it was gone. A second later, another of the same sudden explosion type light happened again in the same place in,the sky. I was very much in shock while watching this and I had a feeling come over me that I have never felt before. Its hard to explain. I have never seen anything like that in my life. I felt comforted, if that makes sense to anyone."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-06032011-0021","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29375.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29375.html"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.021493","Case Number":"29375","City":"Concord","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Concord","There were no other sightings in Concord on or around June 2nd 2011"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.980898,+-122.021493(29375)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29375) map </A>","Region":"California","Summary":"Star-like ufo pusling forward through the stars instantly then disappears following a giant, bright, sudden flash follwed by another flash,seconds later","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.980898","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
