First noticed objects from our location at approx a 65 degree angle to the south brightly light (from the supermoon illumination). As I grabbed camera from tripod to try and obtain a visual, the brightness of these 2 objects cut in half matching background brightness of stars. They stayed at the same distance approx 1 degree to the side and one was an additional 1 degree south of the other. Same rate of speed, same distance entire time in sight. As they progressed North, they kept diminishing in luminosity until we could no longer see them. Total time no longer than 3 mins, probably closer to 2 mins. I suspect Military Jets based on prior military experience working on Jets. I am submitting to Mufon, for verification that it was indeed Military. Approx altitude I estimate to be 50 to 60,000 feet. Size of lights were same as typical stars on a clear evening."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.138788,+-92.669467(38015)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38015) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/05/2012 10:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Case Number":"38015","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Yellville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38015.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38015.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
