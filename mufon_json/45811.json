Then 2 disappeared. Then the two that were left seemed to hover & then one of the objects pulsated quickly as it dropped closer to the other object. I have never seen anything like this before. No of the objects made noise. The two objects seemed to be communicating with one another by pulsating. Then the one object started to rise. That is when I stopped filming because we had to move out of the way for another car."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-75.172343","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.269943,+-75.172343(45811)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45811) map </A>","Summary":"4 glowing objects that hovered with no sound.
