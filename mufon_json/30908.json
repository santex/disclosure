i dont know much about choppers but i didnt think they had models that were so silent. after seeing the chopper out there we shut the blinds and were scared to death,1 minute later we hear this absolutely odd screeching high pitched drilling sound right outside our house - it sounded like someone was drilling or sawing the side of our house. alright by that time i had it - i went and grabbed by 7.62 russian rifle,my brother was horrified and called the police screaming at the dispatcher to send the police to our house that second and that someones outside our house,my brother an 18 year old adult was crying he was so scared. my grandmother during all this was in her bedroom sleeping,by the time she got up my brother was on the phone with the police and she took the phone from him and talked with the dispatcher,the dispatch told my grandmother - oh it just the military doing maneuvers. so is part of military training sending a chopper out to someones house to hover 25 feet in front and 30 feet above shining a spotlight directly in their window?????? i dont think so. i myself believe somehow they knew we filmed those orbs and seen the video on youtube. i dont know,what i do know is that someone in control of a chopper was sent to scare the hell out of us and they succeeded in their job. the noise.... i'm yet to find out what in the world that was,never before or again have i heard that noise. my grandmother also heard the noise from her bedroom. the call from my brother has to be documented in the police archives here. after it all settled we deleted the video from youtube. it is seen on youtube now however,a while later we got the video uploaded to youtube again and have not had any problems yet. now i did some research online and fellow people here in gaylord also reported seeing these orange orbs the exact same date and exact same time as we did - march 30th 2010 around 8:00 pm. we seen the orbs an additional 2 more times over the past year and my grandmother seen them by herself just a few months ago. i have recently purchased an hd camera in hope of catching these orbs again,there is something very very strange going on in our little city of gaylord. thats my story 110% as it happened with no nonsense attached. i just felt i have to let someone know what happened to us that night,i cant hold it in. and i am scared reporting my story to this website,let me say i'm going to be watching my back after i submit this... thats my event and it changed my life."],"Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.664812","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
