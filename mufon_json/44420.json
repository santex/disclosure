I looked into the sky which was very clear and full of stars. I saw this orange cigar shaped object and I said to my friend look at this thing. It moved slowly from the north, stopped and a piece of the same color ( glowing orange ) fell from it, burst into flames and then the object moved slowly off in the same direction it came from. I was then and still am excited and curious as to what it was. My friend to this day still thinks it was nothing. I am still puzzled by his thoughts of this event."],"Source":"MUFON"}
