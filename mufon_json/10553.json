Obviously not. It was low enough to zoom up on it with my camcorder, and showed clear detail. I also do not believe it is very large at all. The other odd thing is that this first picture seems to morph before my eyes, I know this also sounds strange, but I see faces if I rotate the picture at any angle. The other 2 picture are something I cannot explain. I have over 350 pictures to send you but they are all over my computer and it would be just a matter of getting them all together. Please write back or call (collect if you need to) to let me know that you even got this e-mail, as I have sent very few e-mails in my life and I don't know what I am doing. Thank you so much for responding, just wanted to know that I am not alone in seeing things like this.
