They maintained a separated distance in a triangle pattern and appeared to be gaining altitude. I got a pair of binoculars and the objects looked like pictures of the old sky hook balloons. I do not think these are in use any more. It was unusual that these maintained and equal distance from each other and were moving fast and climbing. I lost sight of them when they went behind a cloud. I noticed the objects as they reflected the sun and I was in front of my kitchen window. I just noticed the bright specks moving in a steady but peculiar formation so I went out to look. I had no fear or sense of anything extraordinary but the objects were not aircraft of any type I know of."],"Longitude":"-84.936731","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08052011-0081","Date of the Event":"07/23/2011 06:05 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30315.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30315.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"3 objects flying n.e.
