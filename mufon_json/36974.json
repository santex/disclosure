(so no loss of time) when i first saw it it was so big it took me awhile to recognize that it was all attached and moving together. i didn't know what i was looking at until i started to actually looked at the row of lights that seemed like they were all in a row spreading from me strait across... then i started looking at what the lights were attached to. it was dark in color and boomerang like; metalic. it seemed so silent and so huge!!! then i moved to las vegas in october 2003. i was talking to one of my friends\\rmmt about this object last year; 2011. i drew a picture on a napkin and showed him. he went online and then after about half and hour called me back into the room and showed me this thing that apparently was on tv and i said, \"oh my god! that's it!\". he was showing me the \"arizona lights\". of course this totally was like wow and i saw it in california. i've always thought there was life far more advanced than us and that night cemented my belief. i lost site of it only because i was so tired and really needed sleep and just kept driving towards redlands near sanberdo. don't think the tv showed it from my perspective; the end of the wing tip...and it seemed to be one single curved wing..."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-117.174858","Object Features":"Wings"}
