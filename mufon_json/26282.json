I left my apartment riding my bicycle directly eastward just after crossing the street to ride on the sidewalk. In the east sky about 40 degrees up I noticed a silver inverted pie shaped craft gliding across the sky for about 15 seconds, then I went under a tree which obscured my veiw for about 2 seconds. After I emerged from my blocked sight, the craft was completely gone. Disappeared. The object was about the size of the moon in the sky. I happened to notice this easily because I live in the flight path of Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix. The craft was flying north to south, which I���ve never really seen before. The planes usually fly east to west. The craft might have been in Phoenix flying space going in the wrong direction"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Inverted pie-shaped craft vanishes in sunny, bright Arizona skies","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.43041,+-111.936485(26282)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26282) map </A>","City":"Tempe","Region":"Arizona"}
