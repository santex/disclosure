The UFO hovered above us about 200 ft in the air. We turned the boat motor off and pulled Davey into the boat. We looked up and laughed and made fun, thinking it was a hoax balloon or something. It was orange, yellow and maybe red, and round like a sauser. But we all suddenly got a feeling that something was reading our minds and we all got scared. It took off suddenly to one end of the lake and turned as if putting on a show just for us and zoomed accross us up in to the sky to a pencil lead size in seconds. We got the boat started and ran to the shore where people were lined up looking up at it and it was on the radio that a ufo was over lake sylvan. Lots of people saw it that day."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/23/2011 12:28 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/30/1965 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-85.376645","Case Number":"27960","Log Number":"US-02232011-0006","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
