Initially I thought it might be an airplane because this is an approach pattern to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. As it was moving, it then came to a sudden stop for approx. 2 minutes. It then proceeded to head in a north-northwest direction slowly and then stopped and proceeded on a southern heading. It stopped again for approximately a minute. After that it began to proceed SW and then curve back on a westerly heading. Then the object began to be obscured by clouds. The clouds were thick enough to cover the stars but the object remained partially visible. It was evident that whatever this is it is above the clouds, but bright enough to shine through them. After the clouds came through there were occassional breaks in them, but then a thick patch came over and limited visibility for the duration of the sighting. The object began heading west again, slowly, when I lost it in the clouds."],"Summary":"Star like object over Austin ( ongoing at this time )","Date Submitted":"12/16/2006 11:00 UTC","City":"Austin","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.276123,+-97.736521(5927)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5927) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:10:25","Longitude":"-97.736521","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON"}
