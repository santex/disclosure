I cannot be sure if was visible or if Ilooked as it became visible. I watched it fly for 2-3 seconds and then theobject literally dissappeared - perhaps into the clouds but it really did notadd up. There was absolutely no sound associated with this object. The objectwas triangular with lights on the three axis points white but with less brightwhite lights that seemed to run around the frame of the object. It seemedperhaps that other points of the craft was glowing. I was amazed when I saw theobject and still am to some degree. The sighting was only 3-4 seconds and mybuddy was with me, but I stopped and watched the object almost awestruck and wasjust calling out to my buddy when it dissappeared. The object was moving on astraight path course as I was watching it. Later that night, I had dreams thatrelated to my health."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","trends":["There have been no other sightings in CantonJackson Township","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"01/31/2002 01:01 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.425567,+-82.898263(2057)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2057) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/31/2002 01:01 UTC","Latitude":"40.425567","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"","Case Number":"2057","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Triangle shaped UFO in Northeast Ohio"}
