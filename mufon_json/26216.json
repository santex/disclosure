this is the 2nd strange thing i've seen in the sky out here in the desert in the last month and a half. if anybody else saw it or has any idea what it might have been i would like to know for sure!"],"Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Glendale","There were no other sightings in Glendale on or around October 31st 2010"],"Date Submitted":"10/30/2010 07:24 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/31/2010 01:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:33:00","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-112.232524","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Summary":"Watched light traversing slowly from SE to ENE blinking on every 10 seconds until it disappeared after about a half hour.","Log Number":"US-10302010-0005","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.666994,+-112.232524(26216)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26216) map </A>","Tags":"City","Case Number":"26216"}
