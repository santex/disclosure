I was driving down the Carlisle Pike to my friends house, right as i was about to pass my high school (Cumberland Valley High School) i looked up at the moon which was just about exit from passing behind large cloud coverage. Right as i was about to see the moon i saw a huge blue flash that looked like it fell to the clouds and dissapeared. The Flash was light blue in color and was only visible for about a second but since i was already looking up at the moon i saw the entire event. Right after i saw the flash i text messaged my friend who's house i was on my way to. (this is why i know the exact time that the event happened cause i checked the time i sent the text message before i wrote this report) I've seen \"UFO's\" before but i've only ever reported one before this. This is because i won't report anything unless i am positive i cannot explain what happened. Contact me for more information. thank you."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.218446,+-77.003058(28665)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28665) map </A>","Case Number":"28665","Summary":"Falling Blue glow that flashed really big and dissapeared","Date of the Event":"04/13/2011 11:38 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/14/2011 12:21 UTC"}
