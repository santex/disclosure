{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWent outside to get some fresh air just after 10 pm yesterday (May 5th). First thing I've noticed was a \"shooting start\", I thougth that was pretty cool, first one this year :). Then I have noticed two airplanes far in the distance (me facing West). Then I look up to admire the clear and beautiful night sky, full of stars. All of a sudden, I notice a series of dimmed lights flying in formation. The formation was similar to a shevron, I could also notice a fairly distinct boudary (or the edge) of the object the lights where part of. The object resembled a flying wing like Northrop YB-49 but it almost looked transparent. It flew in a straight line from South to North, at about 80deg up from where I was standing. It was completely silent! I couldn't tell how high (altitude) it was from the ground but in relation to the tree that it flew by, the wingspan was about 1.5 to 2 meters (the tree is about 12 meters tall). The object disappeared behind the tree."],"Region":"Ontario","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47217.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47217.html"],"Country":"Canada","Case Number":"47217","Date Submitted":"05/06/2013 09:29 UTC","Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"51.253775","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/05/2013 10:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle","Longitude":"-85.318204","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Transparent, delta-wing like on a straight, silent, fast flight path.","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.253775,+-85.318204(47217)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47217) map </A>","trends":[],"Log Number":"CA-05062013-0011"}
