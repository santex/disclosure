It did multiple maneuvers and when I tried to get a better look it was already gone, it lasted about 20 or so seconds, maybe less. Whatever it was it wasn't a plane, these go by all the time and they never could move that fast and do so many maneuvers, this thing was able to do a figure 8 then move away so fast it was incredible, it seemed like it came out of nowhere too."],"Longitude":"-78.872669","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"A fast flying orange glowing triangle.","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/03/2010 10:07 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.894557,+-78.872669(24114)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24114) map </A>","Case Number":"24114","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Log Number":"US-07032010-0019"}
