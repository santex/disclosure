Then I caught a light about the color of a planet and about similar brilliance climbing up through the treeline. Obscured by the trees but not at tree level. It climbed up as the plane traveled in a different area. The speeds did not seem relative to each other in terms of convention. The light came to a quick but not jerk like stop, then moved around a bit in a tight wobble like a ball floating in waves. Would have been right above the ladle end of the Big Dipper. I waited about a minute during this event before getting my son, we've seen several events like this but I wanted to make dead sure this time. I even went outside as it climbed and watched it come to a rest standing outside. When my son and I got back out to the driveway, about a minute later, I pointed to where I thought I saw the light but it was just the tip of the Dipper's ladle."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"08/18/2012 01:01 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.97066,+-85.658686(41821)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41821) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
