Turned to watchaircraft flying in to D.I.A.landing pattern. Turned back one planet was gone,the other started to fade, turned to a color like a cigarette cherry and gotsmaller. Then arched about a half inch at arms length and dissapeared. Now, Inoticed about the same type of event a couple days earlier. A little different.Thought you might find that a little interesting also. This is a rural area, thenight sky really sticks out. I see satilites, falling stars and landing lightsall the time.
