{"Weather Factors":"Windy","divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and i may have seen ufo���s this evening in darien, ct. approximate time was 8:45pm est we witnessed approximately 10 (we didn���t think to start counting until a few had gone by) flying objects from a vantage point on the shore of darien ct looking northeast. the craft were traveling in groups of 2-3 heading from the northeast towards the south (towards nyc). they appeared to us as bright orange lights. we\\i did not see any strobe lights or any green or red wing tip lights, which are commonly seen on commercial aircraft in the area (we see aircraft coming and going from laguardia, kennedy and white plains). the craft were travelling south, but turned to what appeared to be the northwest and disappear (the bright orange lights no longer visible). the craft emitted no sound (however there was an on shore breeze blowing in towards the direction of the craft). the craft appeared to fly at the same speed as commercial aircraft in the area. what caught our attention was that they were traveling in pairs (or 3���s) and had a distinctive bright orange ���head lights���. we assumed they must be fighter jets coming to participate in 9\\11 activities���but the fact that they made no sounds and all turned to the northwest and not on over nyc seemed strange."],"Date of the Event":"09/10/2011 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-73.537614","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.05997","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/11/2011 09:25 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"31736","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Stamford","There were no other sightings in Stamford on or around September 10th 2011"],"Region":"Connecticut","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31736.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.05997,+-73.537614(31736)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31736) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Stamford","Log Number":"US-09112011-0008","Summary":"Bright orange lights traveling in pairs from the northeast haeding south, then changed direction to northwest","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
