My father managed to get a video of it but he decided to keep it zoomed in the entire time so to me it looks a little blocky. Any who this looks like the same white object I saw on June 1st with my Mother, Brother and father but this time around it was Me, my father and my mother. This time the object went South East instead of North east and it was just as bright as the one I saw June 1st."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.571452,+-70.079461(48287)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48287) map </A>","Summary":"Looks like same object I reported June 1st","Date Submitted":"06/20/2013 09:53 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-70.079461","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"06/20/2013 09:30 UTC","Case Number":"48287","Latitude":"44.571452","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Chesterville","There were no other sightings in Chesterville on or around June 20th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-06202013-0022","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
