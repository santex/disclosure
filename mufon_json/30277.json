{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was letting my dogs out on the porch when I noticed an extremely large white oddly shaped aircraft above the trees across the street. The blinking lights first caught my attention. I immediately thought it was a U.F.O. It was flying from the north to south at a steady pace. I called for everyone inside to hurry outside to see what they thought it was. We lost sight of it when it appeared to make a left hand turn and started descending. It was an extra large, white, silent, aircraft with huge triangular vertical wings(?) on top with intermittent flashing blue lights and red lights on bottom."],"trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around July 20th 2011"],"Case Number":"30277","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.590312,+-121.49115(30277)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30277) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/20/2011 09:50 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Sacramento","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30277.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30277.html"],"Object Features":"None, Other","Latitude":"38.590312","Date Submitted":"07/21/2011 01:14 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07212011-0003","Summary":"Quick sighting outside of house","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Triangle, Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-121.49115","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
