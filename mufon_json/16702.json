Upon viewing the photos on the computer this formation of three objects appeared in the picture. I never at any time realized there were any unknown objects in the sky. This particular picture had no clouds as I was taking random photographs at the time. I have a friend who has Adobe photoshop and she edited the file to enlarge and bring clarity to the photograph. Copy of original and edited file included. My wife was never a believer in UFO's but she is now.My first impression upon seeing the photograph is 'finally'. I have not seen one since 1968 in Vietnam."],"City":"Westminster","Date of the Event":"04/24/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16702.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16702_submitter_file1__3objects.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16702_submitter_file2__3UFO-edit.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16702.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Taking photos with my digital camera.","Region":"Colorado","Date Submitted":"04/24/2009 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-105.031835","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"16702","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04272009-0011"}
