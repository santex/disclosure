I was just a teenager at the time. It appeared silently over Clifton, NJ about 10 PM. It slowly went northwest from the direction of Newark to Patterson, NJ. The altitude was approximately 1000-2000 feet above the ground. Upon observing it, I stopped.The UFO also stopped. After about 10-15 seconds, an orange glow appeared behind it, and silently it zoomed to the north east. Estimated speed: 300-500 mph. I recall it appearing like a \"flying light bulb\". It has a frosted light bulb shape and when the orange tail appeared, it resembled a light bulb. Since the sighting, I served in the Army, graduated college with a degree in chemistry and have a private pilot license. This is also my second UFO sighting. I regard my experiences are bonefide.
