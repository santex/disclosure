{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting Details Thursday, April 23, 2009 at 9:05 p.m. central time, A UFO flew over my home in Lake Charles, Louisiana. We were driving down Ryan Street heading home, and we turned left by Blockbuster Video Store when I noticed the white lamb shaped cloud that had what appeared to be a genie lamp on its rear end with smoke coming from the lamp. My husband said that the cloud looked like an elephant to him, and he tried to point out the trunk. We giggled, and then arrived at our house. I was busy getting things out of the van when my husband shouted out, ���Hey, - come see what - found!��� Thinking to myself that I was about to look at another Gecko or some creepy crawly thing I walked over to them. They were both starring at the sky, and I looked up and saw flashing colored lights floating way up in the sky in slow motion heading south while moving upward toward the doom of the sky. Baffled I asked, ���Is that a plane?��� My husband said that there was no way it could be a plane, because planes do not move like that. He said that - noticed it first, and he said, ���Look Daddy at the stars moving across the sky!��� I started to make out the image as triangular with a glowing sphere shield around the base. It had colored flashing lights that were blue, yellow, and red making the perfect points for a triangle. I confirmed what I was seeing with my husband, and he said that he saw the same shape I did. The object was way higher than a plane would normally fly, and it was moving so as if they wanted us to see them. I waved and said, ���Hello, my friends.��� My husband pointed at -, and told me to be quiet. We all just watched in awe, and then it speeded up at an impossible speed, and from no where the sky filled with clouds again hiding the object. My four year old said, ���See momma it was the aliens, because I told you they are always up above the clouds.���"],"Summary":"The UFO sighting at my house last night!","City":"Lake Charles","Log Number":"US-04242009-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"30.228345","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Louisiana","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16658.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16658_submitter_file1__ufo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16658.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/23/2009 09:05 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron, Diamond, Oval, Star-like, Triangle","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"04/23/2009 09:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Lake Charles","There were no other sightings in Lake Charles on or around April 23rd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.228345,+-93.215776(16658)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16658) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"16658","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-93.215776"}
