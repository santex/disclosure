It's relatively in the same spot and I have been watching for it every night. This is the first time it has been back. Only one night was not clear, so I'm certain it was not there between the first sighting and now. Just wanted to document this. It definately is moveing around - left, right, up, down... not plane or helicopter like at all."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.429208,+-84.481029(25407)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25407) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/13/2010 09:45 UTC","Longitude":"-84.481029","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25407.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25407.html"],"Log Number":"US-09132010-0007","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.429208","Summary":"It's back!
