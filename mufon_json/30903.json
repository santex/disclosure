I saw 2-3 planes in the sky as well as a bright object traveling away from us with no blinking lights. The planes did not react to the object, but all the planes had blinking lights. My wife also saw this object. I grabbed my binoculars to get a better look at the object, but still did not observe any blinking lights on the object. The object travelled in a straight line away from us, but then slightly turn right a little for a few seconds, then back to the left for a few seconds. It then proceed straight ahead and I lost it behind a tall tree in my neighbors yard."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Glowing object traveling away from us - glowing - changing path slightly","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Palatine","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30903.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30903.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Longitude":"-88.047934","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"30903","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
