{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was inside cleaning up after dinner, went outside for a cig and looked up to see this extremely bright star like object that appeared to be ascending, then changed course and headed north while maintaining a certain height. It then moved what had to be many miles southward again within seconds, and then stopped above the nearby city of Chico, CA or somewhere near its outskirts. I noticed during this time MANY aircraft suddenly were in the sky in the area around the object. At one point a very dim small glowing sphere shot across the sky and seemed to merge with or disappeared into the star like object. Just went outside again and object has completely vanished from the sky."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"01/13/2012 07:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.730524,+-121.835518(35789)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35789) map </A>","Latitude":"39.730524","Date Submitted":"02/13/2012 10:49 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Chico","There was one other sighting in Chico on or around January 13th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Chico","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-121.835518","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35789.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35789.html"],"Case Number":"35789","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02132012-0028","Summary":"Star like object moves erratically across the sky, then hovers."}
