I did not see the shape but we both saw a blue point of light and an amber point of light. The amber point of light was fartherst away. The object was just above or a little below the tree line. The object banked in front of us as it was just above the road. I assumed this because we lost the amber light. We watched the blue point of light continue on a north northeasterly path over a field till we lost sight of it. The object was completely silent. We were on our way to Church at the time on Regan Church Road. I noticed the time after we lost sight of the object."],"Log Number":"US-03112012-0015","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36399.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36399.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Lumberton","There were no other sightings in Lumberton on or around December 21st 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.672775,+-78.921296(36399)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36399) map </A>","City":"Lumberton","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Witnessed a boomerang like object in the sky","Date Submitted":"03/11/2012 05:31 UTC"}
