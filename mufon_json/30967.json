I looked towards the horizon line and saw a rectangular metallic shape rotating end over end in the sky. I watched it move from the horizon line up into the sky. I went inside and called my co-workers & bosses to come see it. When we went outside it had moved farther into the sky, but you could still make out the shape and that it was rotating. 6 people, including myself, watched it move farther away towards the upper atmosphere in a northwardly direction. The total amount of time the object was visible was 7-8 minutes. I felt excited that I got to see it, I only wish I had a camera. I���m glad that I got other people to witness it."],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Features":"Unknown"}
