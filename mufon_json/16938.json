(by the way, we live very close to rickenbacker airport base, and there are flight pathes directly over our house, we get atleast 2-3 life flight helicopters a day, and a few fighter jets.) so, completely stunned, the first thing i want to do is tell someone what i just saw, and almost natrually i called my buddy who lives in tarlton, because he lives withen walking distance of me, so maybe he saw something too. i called him and told him what happened, then i drove to his house, and we sat outside in is backyard. we started to discuss possible explenations when the same type of triangle suddenly apperared from the east, doing the same random flashing thing the last object had done, except it seemed to slow down a couple of times and then started moving at a much faster pace. we watched it until we couldnt see it anymore as it was out of sight headed north west. we smoked a couple of cigarettes and started speculating as of what the hell we had just seen. 20 minutes passed when my friend got up to get us a couple of sodas when he blurted \"holy [cms\\tg\\pd]! do you see that!?\" and to the east there was a cigar shaped object slowly cruising with 3 red lights on the bottom, and 2 white lights on each end which looked to be from inside the object, sort of like observation ports that poured out light. then it zipped away at a much faster rate, atleas 4 times what it was originally going. after a little more time had passed (this happened in less than 2 hours) we saw what looked like a blinking red light, like the kind that are on top of tall antenneaes moving from east to west slowly. it passed over us, and as it pulsed every second or so, there was a dim reflection of the object it was connected to, but it was... transparent i guess is the right word. it moved out on to the horizion to the west and started to blink more rapidly, then seemed to go down, then in a diaganial line then up and slowly faded from red to black. then 10 minutes after that there was a silver flash from the west behind some trees, and the light popped out then slowly dimmed like the red light. we were awe struck. after it cooled down for 15 min. my friend got up and went to the bathroom, and right as he walked in a helicopter zoomed over heading south from north, flying quite low."],"City":"Tarlton","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"16938","Disposition":"Hoax","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/15/2009 11:39 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16938.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16938.html"],"Longitude":"-82.776005","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cigar, Flash, Star-like, Triangle","Log Number":"US-05152009-0005","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Tarlton","There were no other sightings in Tarlton on or around May 15th 2009"]}
