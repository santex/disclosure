The night was suprisingly starry. The UFO appered as a star. The UFO was about the size of a golf ball from my point of view. The UFO was to the right of the moon about two fist sizes. It started to move slowly to the left. When it just got past the moon, it bolted to the right and went behind the moon."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"08/08/2011 08:27 UTC","Case Number":"30649","Date of the Event":"05/21/2004 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Spherical, glowing, and slow.","Longitude":"-96.866108","City":"DeSoto","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in DeSoto","There were 2 other sightings in DeSoto on or around May 21st 2004","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-08082011-0019","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30649.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30649_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30649.html"],"Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.5888","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
