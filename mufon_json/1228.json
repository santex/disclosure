Every door and window in the houseshock. I thought that it was a furnace or gasoline explosion close by. I ranoutside, and everyone in the neighborhood was outside, wondering what happened.I turned on the radio later on, and got a Williamsport radio station, gettingcalls from people in Williamsport, reporting the same thing. Williamsport isabout 32 miles north of Lewisburg. Later, talking to relatives, I found out thatthey also heard the explosion in Selinsgrove (20 miles south) and Sunbury(15miles south-west of Lewisburg. It was truly a scary experience."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.964529","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Lewisburg","There were no other sightings in Lewisburg on or around July 23rd 2001"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/23/2001 06:35 UTC"}
