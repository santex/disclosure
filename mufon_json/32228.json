It was perfectly quiet flying in formation. No lights were visible except for two which we decending and had like landing lights on. They were apparently absorbed by the six bigger objects. They made a turn about a point and went over a business but were huge when they came over us. The first turn about a point was a left turn. They made another turn about a point in an ascending manner to the right. Then they just hit the button and were out of sight fast enough you could only observe one. Apparently they hit the edge of our atmosphere and emitted a bright blue pinpoint of light and just disappeared. I had just closed on a house and was moving so I had no camera. However I can make a very detailed drawing and can show the flight path involved."],"Latitude":"40.401377","Case Number":"32228","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.401377,+-104.745706(32228)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32228) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32228.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32228.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Blimp","Date Submitted":"09/30/2011 06:39 UTC"}
