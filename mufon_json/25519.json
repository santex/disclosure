We were driving through town, through the intersections, when my friend joking said \"Hey look, a UFO!\" while pointing at what looked like a plane in the sky. My response was \"No, shut up. It's just a plane.\" Then we argued about it's shape and size and lights. Until I was mostly convinced that it wasn't a plane. It was in a triangle formation. Most planes have the two flashing lights on their wings. This had three white lights at its tips and a red light in the center. It was moving very slowly and silently and was also very low down. We watched as it flew over us until traffic moved forward and it went away from view."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25519.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25519.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.975371,+-123.815722(25519)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25519) map </A>","Longitude":"-123.815722"}
