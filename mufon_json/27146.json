We estimate the object was hovering over Hillsboro Pike somewhere between grassland middle school and further north to the intersection of Old Hickory and hillsboro. Because it hovered in place without motion, we decided to redirect our van by turning off hwy 96 turning left to point north so we could pull of the road near gentry farm to simply observe it. We observed it for several more minutes then simply \"glided\" away to our right moving northeast, without any noticable acceleration. It didn't seem to turn upon moving so it maintained its visual impression upon us until it departed out of our field of vision."],"City":"Brentwood","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"36.033116","Date Submitted":"12/28/2010 08:27 UTC","Date of the Event":"12/27/2010 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-12282010-0007","Longitude":"-86.782777","Case Number":"27146","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27146.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27146.html"],"Region":"Tennessee","Summary":"hovering bright object with five white lights","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
