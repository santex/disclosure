We had no idea what could be that large and go that fast. There was a helicopter stationary in the area and the craft was much larger. I got part of it on an iphone video but it only looks like a white dot in the video. Completely freaked us out. My friend said it had two beams that came out of it before it disappeared on the west side. I didn't see that part as I was trying to take the video and a tree in the front yard was in the way and I lost it after that."],"City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40830.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40830.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Missouri","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.966533,+-91.827243(40830)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40830) map </A>","Longitude":"-91.827243","Date Submitted":"07/15/2012 11:30 UTC","Latitude":"37.966533","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Large Chinese Lantern Shape crossing over all of St. Louis in Minutes","trends":[]}
