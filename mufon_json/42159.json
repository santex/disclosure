As we were turning about a corner going left, we spotted something peculiar in the sky. At first we just stared...was it a plane? Helicopter? As we continued to stare it shape shifted from a crescent moon type outline of a ship, with a projected red light upwards toward the sky, to a full out BALL OF FIRE! This thing hovered low to the ground to the point that it was something you HAD to notice! It came from the direction of the moon. Following this ship, came 20-30 more! My boyfriend and I pulled over and watched in amazement as they all shifted shapes and passed over us. At one point I yelled \"LOOK IN THE SKY!\" at that moment one of the ships began hovering above us, then it moved on. They appeared to be slightly disappearing, then reappearing yet staying on the same path the whole time! Two helicopters were stalking these things and trying to go around them. I was not a total believer....now I am. OMG is all I can say. You don't believe it until you see it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed"}
