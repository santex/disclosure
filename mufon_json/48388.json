Turned left after Target to head over bridge. To my left, over the Target or VRE train station, noticed something hovering stationary in the air, maybe a few hundred feet up. Now that I think about it, there is an electricity transformer station there as well and the object could have been hovering over that. Both son and I saw it and neither of us could really tell what the object was. Maybe about the size of a large car, kind of disc shaped --- imagine a dark grey balloon that's semi deflated just floating there. But it wasn't a balloon because it didn't move at all that we saw. We even pulled over to look at it. It did not move, had no real shape to it. It had no lights on it that we could tell. My phone didn't have enough battery power to take a picture, which is really unfortunate. I took my son to his friend's house, drove home the same way to see it again but it wasn't there. However, there was some other kind of helicopter or aircraft in the vicinity with two very bright lights slowly blinking on and off. I have no idea if this was related. Also, not sure if it's related, but the street lights on a lot of the roads in the area were out. The stop lights were working but the street lights were out all the way down to the beltway."],"Region":"Virginia","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
