All of a sudden I saw something in the sky. I was sort of freaked out so I ran inside to get my digital camera. When I came out it was still there and I took 3 pictures but only 1 turned out. We were amazed by this so we kept watching it for about 5 more minutes. It was going in a straight line left and it didnt make a noise. It also changed shapes. First it was like a disc the it turned flat. Finally we kept watching it and we looked at it until it disappeared into the air right in front of our eyes. When we first saw it I thought it was a bunch of balloons but they would of been floating upwards."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Without noise","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Saturn-like, Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/17/2008 05:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:52:17","Case Number":"12727","Latitude":"39.655715","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.655715,+-78.755548(12727)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12727) map </A>","Region":"Maryland","Date of the Event":"07/17/2008 05:45 UTC","Longitude":"-78.755548","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12727.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12727_submitter_file1__S6300542.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12727_submitter_file2__S6300543.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12727_submitter_file3__S6300544.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12727.html"]}
