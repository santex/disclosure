Above the light I could make out a triangle shape dark gray object. The object was moving at a moderate speed, (maybe a little faster than a small aircraft), going west to east in a straight line making no noise. I did return to my house to grab my camera but object had disappeared, which was odd as I was only gone for seconds."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38184.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38184.html"],"Object Features":"None"}
