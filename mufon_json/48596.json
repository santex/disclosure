This section of Rt 2 is flat and wide open so I had no trees or anything obstructing the view for several minutes. At first, I assumed it was a plane, but then every 10 seconds or so I'd glance at it again and it was not moving at all. The not moving was what really caught my attention. I'd like to believe it was just a commercial jetliner, only problem was (a) it had no wings (b) it wasn't moving at all over the course of several minutes (c) it occasionally glowed a little even in broad daylight -- just a slight halo of pale light. I'd like to believe it was a single solitary lenticular cloud except that it was too uniform in shape and too solid-looking. There were absolutely no clouds anywhere in the entire sky at this time. After a couple-three minutes of driving while intermittently glancing at it, it vanished."],"Region":"Washington","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07042013-0007","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Washington","There were 4 other sightings in Washington on or around July 3rd 2013"],"Object Shape":"Cigar, Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.896682,+-77.026946(48596)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48596) map </A>","City":"Washington","Date of the Event":"07/03/2013 01:10 UTC"}
