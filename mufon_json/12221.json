I was just about to a big curve in the road, when I saw what were like very bright beams of light coming from the south as I came thru the turn I could see the bright light beams cutting though the dark night. sky, I slow my south bound travel down to see what it was as it was getting close to me coming from the South in a North, North West track I could see where these bright light were come from It was from an large rectangle object with two rows of 4 lights the brightest I���ve ever seen. At first I thought maybe they where helicopters searching for drugs but then quickly said no the lights would be shining downwards and the wouldn���t have been so uniformed this lights look like they were solidly attached To something huge like a large rectangle as this object drifted toward me and I was getting closer to it, I could believe what I was seeing I thought of my friend a MUFON Member and said I don���t carry what time it is I calling him. I did and woke him up as I talked to him and explained and asked him what the heck this thing is. I creped up to a stop sign on Matlock rd. and Hwy 242 where I stopped and just watched as this object floated closer and closer and I was telling my friend what I was seeing I told him I was getting out of here and hung up. But I stayed there at the stop sign to watch it a little longer , I had no camera , I had both widows down on my truck the there were no sounds it was eerily quite it moved passed me I bent over and look out the passenger side window at this point I could see only the top and bottom lights on the corner closest to me and the beams cast a light way out in front of it, as I watched it float by I could see the dark outline of something massive behind the light at this point I had a fear come over me and immediately hit the gas and never looked back. I wanted to but just couldn���t do it."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.99174,+-86.442442(12221)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12221) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Bowling Green","There was one other sighting in Bowling Green on or around August 24th 2008"],"Longitude":"-86.442442","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12221.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12221.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Kentucky"}
