{"Date of the Event":"11/02/2011 04:30 UTC","Object Features":"Other","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside looking at the stars and a large craft was moving to the west and slowly changed direction to southwest. i could see it in the shape of a boomerang or chevron.I could not see the back shape of it, only by its illuminating outline I was able to see it. I was just thinking no way. It kind of looked like the bottom of the front of a boat. the outline had a red hue and looked almost like stars moving together, you could definitely tell it was some kind of craft. After it changed directions, it disappeared from sight, but slowly like it was going farther away not just disappeared. It was in the air very high. I am not sure what size it was but it was definitely large than a plane by like 20x. It looked like it was following a path of flight, as in, no sporadic movement."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/02/2011 07:49 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Longitude":"-116.201176","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.618631,+-116.201176(33067)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33067) map </A>","Summary":"Large craft in the shape of a cheveron or boomerang over Boise","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.618631","Country":"United States","City":"Boise","Region":"Idaho","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33067.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33067.html"],"trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There were no other sightings in Boise on or around November 2nd 2011"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-11022011-0008","Case Number":"33067"}
