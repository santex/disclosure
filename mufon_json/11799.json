I was just taking a few shots of my dog in a wheat field behind the station because the sky and colors were so vivid and made a perfect picture. I returned home a day later and never really looked at the pictures. In fact, I moved the file several times before ever looking at these pictures and that is why the time and date are now a little vague to me. So about 2 weeks ago I finally looked at the pictures on my computer and now I can see a shape to the left of the moon that is clearly something unidentifiable. I will send two pictures to you so you can see in the second that it was not a spot on the lens as is is not there a couple of seconds later."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.158168","City":"Dover"}
