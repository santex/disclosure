The triangle was made by three globes -- white and reddish. Next to the triangle at the widest side were two globes reddish that were next to it. This was a very large formation that was there for only about 30 seconds -- it was stationary and did not move. Silent. I got up to get my camera and then changed my mind and went back to see it again, and it was gone. It was definitely there and unlike any formation I have ever seen.
