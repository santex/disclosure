As her eyesadjusted to the dark, she notice several small red and white lights on thecentral portion of the black e objects underside. These periodically \"jumped\"to displace one another in position and color. After a half-hour, she summonedher husband, who witnessed the event for the next 70 minutes.The object slowly but continuously moved in perpendicular lines, offering theimpression of mapping. Its overall movement was from south to north. As itmoved further away over time, they had the impression that the objects shapewas conical. No sound was associated with the object at any time. After viewingit for 100 minutes, they detected it was ascending vertically until it was lostin the black sky.The wife had the impression that the object was at high altitude and thereforeextremely large. The husband believed it was somewhat lower, though still atconsiderable altitude."]}
