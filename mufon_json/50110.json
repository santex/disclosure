I looked up as I was also star gazing and saw a UFO traveling from the north to the south. When I pointed it out to my family the only other one that saw it was my niece. It then flashed and disappeared into blackness or space. I thought that it was a satellite at first but a satellite doesn't move like that. That was at 9:10 pm. At 9:28Pm I saw another UFO going from the South to the North acting the same way and it also disappeared. At 9:40Pm I saw another UFO traveling from the northwest to the Southeast across the sky making a total of 3 UFO's in a time frame of about 30 minutes. I then packed up and went home to come and report these incidents to MUFON. I see UFO's on a regular basis and we seem to be getting a lot of action up here.
