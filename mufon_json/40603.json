Most of them were only just above the tree line and he was disappointed that we couldnt go over and see them closer. All of a sudden he yells out that he sees a UFO. Of course, as a parent I count it to a childs over active imagination and tell him its probably just a cool firework. He stands his ground and contines telling me it wasnt fireworks. All of a sudden he yells out again that another one has joined the first one and they are flying in the sky. Because Im driving I cant look out the window to where he is pointing and still think its probably fireworks. The next day I check the reports of the last couple days and notice there is one from a man in Belton that sees exactly what my son was describing. Pretty fascinated that he actually did see a UFO I contact KS MUFON who urges me to make a report on it. I think its pretty cool that after all the sightings I have had my son has had one himself now."],"Log Number":"US-07082012-0020","City":"Belton","Date Submitted":"07/08/2012 02:08 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40603.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40603.html"],"Latitude":"38.820623","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.820623,+-94.528868(40603)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40603) map </A>"}
