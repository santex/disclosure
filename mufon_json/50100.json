My grandpa showed us the weird object. It made me feel weird and excited at the same time. I knew it was a UFO from the start! It was hovering,vibrating, all sorts of stuff!!! It also had a weird glow. It was shaped like a triangle and had 7 lights around it. There were 5 different colors. After the sighting, I didn't play Minecraft, I didn't do nothing! I went right on the nearest computer and reported that UFO sighting! That is my description of that weird sighting."],"Date Submitted":"08/23/2013 09:28 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"It was unnerving and awesome at the same time.","Longitude":"-77.062782","Latitude":"42.639635","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50100.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50100.html"],"Log Number":"US-08232013-0028","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
