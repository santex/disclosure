He pointed to this disc which was about 90 degrees above us but a little to the south. The bottom was sparkling in very bright lights that are hard to describe. They were orange and yellow and were changing. My first thought was something was on fire. The size was like a fruit jar lid held at arms length. It was moving fast from east to west. As it moved away you could see the shape which reminded me of a circular parachute like they used in WWII. It was black in color. It took about 15 seconds to move from above us to behind the trees across the street. It is hard to judge the size but it seemed large we had no idea as to how high it was in the sky. The SAC airbase would be less than 50 miles from the sighting and I thought it odd that they didn't check this out. We both had cameras, but were so dumbfounded neither thought of filming this. It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29921.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29921.html"],"Region":"Nebraska","Log Number":"US-07042011-0022"}
