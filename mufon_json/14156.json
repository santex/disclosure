He said he saw something in the sky that was moving rather fast and began to coax me out of the car to take a look. By the time I got out it was out of my view but I told him I would drive to a better area to take a look. I parked the car at the Kiwanis Park and got out with camera in hand. We watched what my son thought was the fast moving light for about 15 minutes. It was facing the east. We both observed it flashing colors of red and blue. I knew it stayed stationery because I found a cluster of stars in the sky and found the bright blinking star right under it. We saw an airplane fly below it at some point. He and I took 5 photos and in two of them there is a strange round shape that I cannot explain. At a glance it's barely visible but I was able to zoom in better with my Photoshop program and could see that it's more of a clustered circle...very strange."],"Case Number":"14156","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Star-like object flashing colored lights","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ohio","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Austinburg","There were no other sightings in Austinburg on or around November 29th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"11/29/2008 07:45 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.771986,+-80.854759(14156)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14156) map </A>","Latitude":"41.771986","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
