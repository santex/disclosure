Watched it for 20 minutes and got binoculars, 2 pair, and got neighbor to see what she thought. We both watched it for over an hour and it is still in the sky as I report. It is stationary with a little movement to the West. Many we are in flight path for O'Hare airport and many planes and helecopters have passed under the object. When sighting it through binoculars (wish we had a telescope) the object is round and very bright with lights all around the perimeter, from time to time it turns and appears oblong. As I mentioned it is still there."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52305.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52305.html"],"Region":"Illinois","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11192013-0015","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Watched object with binoculars, neighbor also.
