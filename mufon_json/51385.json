My brother in law, Niece and myself were sitting on lawn chairs in the front yard watching the meteor shower when we spotted a fast moving triangle shaped craft with very dim amber lights heading east of us at a high rate of speed and it made a sharp turn heading south east. The craft seemed to be fairly low in altitude and made no noise at all. At about 8:45 P.M. my wife, brother in law and myself witnessed a smaller craft going the same exact path as the first sighting. This craft had no lights and made no noise."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51385.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51385.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/08/2013 02:02 UTC","Case Number":"51385","Latitude":"36.783761","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Triangle Shaped Craft"}
