{"divs":["sighting details i live about 4 miles north of downtown south bend indiana and a mile and a half north of notre dame indiana. at 10:15 pm on july 13 2013 i was watching tv when i looked out of my living room window to the south and saw a red\\orange object traveling from the east going to the west. it looked to be about twice the size of the brightest star. i went out into my back yard and saw that there were two of them. i got my phone in video mode and filmed them until they went behind my neighbors trees. i saw that there were three more coming into view and i filmed them as well until they also went behind the trees. i switched my phone into hd mode and got another, much better video of one of the objects. when i zoomed into the last one you can see its colors changing rapidly. they were all traveling at the same speed and in the same direction but not in a straight line. one was a little lover than the rest. i don���t know how fast they were moving but they came into view from around a tree to my due south and went out of my view behind my neighbors tree to the southwest of my house, in about a minuet to a minuet and a half. after the six objects all were out of view i stayed outside for another half hour to see if there were any more. there were not."],"Date Submitted":"07/14/2013 01:45 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/13/2013 10:15 UTC","City":"South Bend","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.730819","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in South Bend","There was one other sighting in South Bend on or around July 13th 2013"],"Longitude":"-86.220853","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.730819,+-86.220853(48930)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48930) map </A>","Summary":"I saw 6 red/orange objects fly from east to west.
