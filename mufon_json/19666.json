His back-yard is facing the mountain and forest. Last Christmas he asked me about satillites. He said at night a spot light was shinning down in his bedroom window. Something woke him up and he saw it. The funny thing is that when he goes to the window the light fades but when he gets back in bed it gets bright. It happend at least 3 nights then he hung a blanket in his window. We were kidding it was a UFO. Then I learnd about the Bucks Co rash of sightings."],"Summary":"Strange light in window","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/27/2009 12:25 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.940327","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Effort","There were no other sightings in Effort on or around November 29th 2008"],"Log Number":"US-09272009-0001","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Effort","Tags":"City","Case Number":"19666","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.940327,+-75.436157(19666)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19666) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/29/2008 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-75.436157"}
