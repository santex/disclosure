They moved in a fairly straight path following one another with a distance in between. With my arm stretched, they were at a height of an index finger length above the roof-top of the neighbor's house (a few feet) across my street. The objects were silent, moved along very slowly, flying toward the east. After as few minutes of observing, I saw them moving much closer together, now looking like they formed a triangle for a few seconds, while hovering on the same spot. Then they continued on toward the east. Then I heard a helicopter noise, but didn't see one. Earlier, approx. 4:50 AM, I also saw an orange ball in the sky from my back-yard, moving along silently, from north to east. I only saw it for a few seconds, after which it disappeared behind the buildings in the distance. This orange object was the same I have seen and reported on July 16, 2011, except it had no smaller lights below it. This time it was moving along fairly quickly."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08182011-0008","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"30979","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Orlando","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"08/18/2011 05:52 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/18/2011 05:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida"}
