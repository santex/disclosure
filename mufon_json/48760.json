{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","divs":["sighting detailswhile watching fireworks on the lake my daughter-in-law pointed out a stationary red light in the sky. at first sight i responded that it was more than likely a light from a tower but it was a bit peculiar since i had not seen it before. we watched it for about 20 minutes. while we watched, the light appeared to very slowly ascend a noticeable distance. the light resembled a stoplight with a slight hourglass shape. it did not make any sudden movements and no noise could be heard due to fireworks and due to it's apparent distance from us. the object suddenly disappeared as if someone had turned out the light. we are located within thirty miles of a military base\\camp. we were not scared...only curious. we have had multiple friends share their sightings of similar lighted objects in the last few months."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Conway","There was one other sighting in Conway on or around July 4th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Case Number":"48760","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07072013-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48760.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48760.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 09:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"35.035108","City":"Conway","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"While watching fireworks on the lake my daughter-in-law pointed out a stationary red light in the sky.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.035108,+-92.41766(48760)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48760) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Sphere","Region":"Arkansas","Longitude":"-92.41766","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/07/2013 12:08 UTC"}
