So we layed down in the driveway when all the sudden I realize that this star was moving in a square formation. So i tell my friend about it and he catches a glimpse of it moving in the square formation, but not less than 10seconds after i mentioned it to him the star-like thing started moving across the sky and we followed it with are eye till it got completely to the other side of the sky then it shot off leaving a trail that disintegrated from the end of the trail all the way to were the trail started. We both witnessed about 3 of those star-like thing's all leaving a trail except for one, The last one we saw was definitely much larger than the others. It seemed as if it had some kind of cloak around it, as it passes other star's the stars would disappear and it would leave some kind of wave in the sky as it passes through. This one also shot off but it was the one that didn't leave a trail. While this bigger star-like thing was moving across the sky, it appeared that starts were popping up around it."],"Date of the Event":"09/08/2012 11:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
