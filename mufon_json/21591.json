I was driving to work going south down Alabama road. The object was so bright and I was approximately one mile away from the object. I lost sight of it behind some trees, but thought I could see it when I got to state road. I was very excited to see the object, however, when I got to the road I was to afraid to head east in the direction of the object. The reason I am telling about it now is what I saw is in the mufon opening pictoral at about the 1:37 mark."]}
