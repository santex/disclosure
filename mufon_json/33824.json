Went back outside 5 minutes later and it was in the same exact spot, it pulsated blue and yellow then started to flicker, then dim then suddenly dissappear and i could see the clouds behind it very clear like it just vanished so i know it wasnt a helicopter because there was no noise and it wasn't a plan because it was just low enough not to be a plane and also it just vanished into thin air, father saw it as well."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"33824","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.178092,+-98.04635(33824)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33824) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33824.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33824.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/04/2011 06:45 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Donna","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Donna","There were no other sightings in Donna on or around December 4th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-98.04635"}
