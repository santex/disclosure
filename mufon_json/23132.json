{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOk, they're back ..My friend called me on my phone and said quick look outside those lights are back. So I went out there, saw nothing at first after about 5 minutes multiple lights came on. Usually they would come on in a row of some sort. This time they came on about 6 of them but staggered, but this time one of the orange lights was actually 3 smaller orange lights grouped into one (if that makes sense). They didn't come back on after that. So if you're in the area please looks the following nights between 9pm-10pm. Last time they came back every night for I can't remember now but I think it was 8 or 9 nights in a row."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"05/04/2010 10:49 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Multiple Orange Lights","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"23132","Object Shape":"Other","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There was one other sighting in Abilene on or around May 4th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-05042010-0020","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-99.728774","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.450636,+-99.728774(23132)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23132) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Country":"United States","City":"Abilene","Date of the Event":"05/04/2010 09:20 UTC","Latitude":"32.450636","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23132.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23132.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
