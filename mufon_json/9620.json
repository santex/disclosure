I was sitting on the sand at the beach, about 20 feet from the water. I noticed a light traveling from north to south at about 1000 feet altitude, probably traveling at about 200 mph. This was a solid, white light with no blinking red or green lights like those of a helicopter or an airplane.I was on a west facing beach looking toward Catalina Island. The name of the beach is Sunset Beach, in So. California. I watched the light on it's south bound course for about 15 seconds, and then it abruptly assumed a 45 degree angle to the water, and went into the water. It was probably several miles off the coast, so i didn't see or hear any results of the impact, like splashes or noise of the impact. One odd thing about the change of course was that there was no gradual turn into the 45 degree dive, it was very abrupt. I saw a program on TV about underwater anonalies (USOs)and it brought back the memory of this sighting."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9620.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9620.html"],"Case Number":"9620","City":"Sunset Beach","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sunset Beach","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/15/1975 01:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
