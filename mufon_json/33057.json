(around 40 seconds of watching it) i told my friend that i was with to watch it with me. he and i watched it as it was stationary for 30 seconds or so, then it took off again moving at an un-real rate! then it seemed to stop and move in almost a star-like pattern. it almost looked as if it was playing with the sky. it left no trail, made no noise, and didnt blink. it was a solid light that was white\\gold. at one point it did seem to change shape from a sphere, to a diamond. the size of the object was like looking at a pencil eraser from 4 feet away. it was hard to really tell the exact shape because it appeared to be very high. it was like watching someone playing with a cat laser toy shining against a wall to see how fast they could make it move. but when it stopped, it did not shake. we watched it move, stop, move, stop for around 2 minutes or so, then it took off south. very,very fast and we never saw it again. we sat there looking for it again trying to figure out what we had seen and to this day, neither of us have any idea. i do know one thing, no person could have survived that sort of movement."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date Submitted":"11/01/2011 11:31 UTC","Region":"Nevada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33057.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33057.html"],"Longitude":"-119.779472","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"Rapidly moving white/gold light."}
