I am a designer and stepped outside my to take a digital picture of the full moon. I didn't see the image of the UFO when I took the picture, I was focused on the moon. I pulled up the picture of the moon and as I was trying to determine size and crop, I saw the image of the UFO only then. I didn't notice the UFO at all so I have no information of flight, movement, sound, etc. The pictures below have not been manipulated at all, just cropped and arrow inserted to see where to look. The first image is the raw imaged as photographed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42233.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42233.html"],"Region":"Maine","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-70.60199","Date of the Event":"06/11/2012 02:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09022012-0026","City":"Standish","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/02/2012 04:40 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Standish","There were no other sightings in Standish on or around June 11th 2012"],"Country":"United States"}
