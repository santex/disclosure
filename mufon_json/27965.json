(ex-see the telephone pole? directly above that about an inch.) she still couldn't see it and as i watched it, it appeared to come towards us. it seemed to get larger and all of a sudden it began to emit a light. my wife then noticed the object. the light became extremely bright in a matter of 2 seconds or so then faded out. i saw the object for maybe 1 more second and then it just disappeared. my wife could no longer see the object either. the light that came out of the object was different than any light i have ever seen. i can't really compare it to any thing else. it was a whitish-blue color. very bright. i know this sounds strange but it's as if i could feel it . i had a very peaceful feeling immediately afterwards. my wife and i were (and still are) very excited about seeing this. we stayed for a few more minutes and decided to go home. the time was 5:55pm. on the way home we stopped at a publix to return a movie and upon exiting the store (6:30pm) we saw 3 low flying military helicopters flying in the direction of the airport (clearwater\\st pete). the airport from this direction is se. the store is located at the intersection of missouri ave and lakeveiw dr. we often see coast guard helicopters, especially in the summer but i have never seen these particular type helicopters in this area. maybe it was coincidence. but they were there."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.691464","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Log Number":"US-02232011-0011","Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None"}
