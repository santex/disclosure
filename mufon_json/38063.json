I noticed it because it was very bright shining out of the sky. I watched it the whole way to the store and back, When my boyfriend and I got back to the house I said something to him, he kept saying its just a star. It then changed shape to a triangle type shape, at that point my boyfriend became interested in it. We started seeing other lights going up to it and passing by it. Our neighbor came out and asked what we were doing, I did not say to much cause I did not want him to think I was crazy, he then looked up and saw it and said its the great eye watching us. He also saw it changing shape, and said see it it looks like rays of lights coming out at the points. My boyfriend and I got in the car to see if we could get closer, we could not! We came back to the house it was still in the sky but had moved a bit to the right, I came inside to get my camera, went back out and it was gone."],"Date Submitted":"05/10/2012 11:28 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Large bright white light!
