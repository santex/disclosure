The object was lower in altitude than the plane. It flew the same speed and line as the plane. The direction is in line with Wright Patterson ab. They were flying at a high altitude but I could make the wings of the plane but not the cylinder and the shape was about three times longer than the width. THe sun was bright and the object appeared white. The plane left a vapor trail, the object didn't. My thought was,I've never seen two jets flying the same line and then there are no wings on the white object. I don't have any idea that what I saw was made by the government or if it was significant at all."],"Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date Submitted":"11/13/2009 08:42 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.994594","City":"Columbus","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.967176,+-82.994594(20500)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20500) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11132009-0012","Summary":"Object was moving in tandom to what looked like a military transport"}
