Approx. June 20, 1994- Leaving work at 4:00pm and was in the IHOP parking lot, preparing to drive home. Looked up and saw something shocking. 2. Saw dark disc above trees. 3.& 4. Disc shaped object, hovering above a small forested area across the interstate highway. Object was 'wobbling' as it hovered. One second it would seem to disappear, then as it wobbled a different direction, it would become visible until it rotated, becoming \"cloaked like the ships in Star Trek\". Therefore, one second it was visible, then the next it was not. Object was approximately 60 feet in diameter, 6 feet top to bottom. Appeared black except when it took on another angle, then it 'disappeared' (reflected it's surroundings). Elevation: 80 to 100 feet, hovering. Distance: 800 to 1,000 feet. 5.& 6. Transfixed, somewhat scared, watching the object until it vanished and did not reappear. Observed approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Don't know if the object just stopped moving, or if it took off at 'light speed'."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc","Date Submitted":"01/13/2010 03:43 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21474.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21474.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"While preparing to leave work, saw \"cloaked\" disc over woods.","Longitude":"-86.774693","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.16774,+-86.774693(21474)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21474) map </A>","Case Number":"21474","Latitude":"36.16774"}
