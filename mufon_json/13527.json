The object seemed as thought it was suspended in midair and it was about treetop level. It did not appear to be a helicopter at all because it was shaped like a triangle and was way too large. We were driving around 70mph and so this all happened very quickly but we thought maybe it was a brightly lit tower in the field but then it started moving across the interstate in a southward direction very slowly around 10 or 15 mph and disappeared over the trees on the south side of I64. We were very disturbed by what we saw, and unfortunately did not have time to take a picture."]}
