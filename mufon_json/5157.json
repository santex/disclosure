We were driving home from work at about 1AM and this object appeared to drop quickly down from a cloud. We drove around trying to see exactly where it was, in case it landed. It hovered in one place. Finally, we drove down North Austin and in the middle of the neighborhood street it remained over that one house. We parked on the corner and just watched it. It was there at least one hour. It looked like a white ball with a cross of light shining off the sides of it. A light came on at the corner of the home briefly and the sphere shot straight up in the air and was gone. No sound at all. Very spooky."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-94.148576","Date of the Event":"07/28/2006 01:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Cross, Sphere","Country":"United States","Case Number":"5157","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-07292006-0002","Region":"Arkansas","Date Submitted":"07/28/2006 01:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.06411,+-94.148576(5157)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5157) map </A>","Latitude":"36.06411","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Fayetteville","There were no other sightings in Fayetteville on or around July 28th 2006"]}
