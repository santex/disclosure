It was about 11 pm. and, as I often do, I was looking up at the night sky while I paced around. I saw a large, pale blue, circular light off to my left moving very very rapidly. It appeared in my line of sight, seemingly, out of nowhere and disappeared from view in just another 2-3 seconds. My view was obstructed by some trees but it was quite easy to see that it was pale blue and extremely bright. It was so bright, in fact, that I was able to see the glow of the light past the edge of the trees it was moving behind. From my point, looking up from the ground, the object appeared to be near the size of a basketball in the sky. Just a month of two ago, I filed a report of a sighting of a similar object that appeared to me in the same fashion except for the fact that it was much smaller, or further away from me. Both were circular, both were the same very bright pale blue, and both appeared and moved tremendously fast before disappearing from my sight. I've included a sketch of what I saw with this report but please bear with me as I am about as far from an artist as a person, with full use of his hands, can be. I tried to illustrate the obstruction of the trees and the fact that the glow and shape of the craft was still apparent to me."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Plant City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30751.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30751_submitter_file1__Sighting08062011001.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30751.html"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-82.144067","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Plant City","There were no other sightings in Plant City on or around August 6th 2011","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Date Submitted":"08/09/2011 07:21 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Very bright pale blue circle moving very fast overhead.
