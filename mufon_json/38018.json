There were no lights, but maybe some faint reflections, because the front V shape of the object first caught my eye. Then by the view of stars disappearing above it I judged it was triangular, but possible saucer shaped. At a steady moderate speed it passed directly overhead toward the mountains, in sight for about 15 seconds. Absolutely no sound. No wind, planes or cars making any sounds at that moment. The apparent size at the distance of my outstretched hand was between golfball and baseball size."],"Tags":"City"}
