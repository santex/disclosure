As my friend was pulling out of the driveway my mom sited a very unusual formation of three unusually large bright Golden light orbs angled (to the right) in a straight line equidistant from each other hovering above and beyond her neighbor's house above the trees behind it in Akron, Ohio at the top of Firestone Hill (the highest point in Akron, Ohio). The lights seemed to just hover at an angle for 10 minutes then very slowly the angle changed to the left and started slowly moving to the east. The lower orb could be seen moving behind the trees. My mom got my friend out of the car to see what was going on. The orbs continued to move very slowly for another ten minutes then just vanished. This location is pretty high up and has very little light pollution if any due to their location."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.991279,+-81.511454(46561)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46561) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Longitude":"-81.511454","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"3 large orbs angled in a straight line, hovered then moved south then southeast and vanished.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
