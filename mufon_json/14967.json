In the southwestern sky noticed what initially thought was Venus. But, at the time of day of 4:55pm was too early to be up and seen with the sun just approaching the horizon. I stared and noticed it was moving when compared to the power lines. The motion was downward when compared to the power lines. It was brilliant and bright like a star if you were to see a star in mid-day then simply it vanished after about a minute. I live nearby to LAX and being a plane euthusiast I am quite sure that it wasn't a plane. Reflections of planes don't resemble a star-like resemblence."],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Date Submitted":"01/17/2009 04:50 UTC","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
