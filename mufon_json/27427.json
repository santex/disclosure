It hovered for a moment, then shot to the right and disappeared. It wasn't a plane because it moved so fast, and it shot across the sky so fast , never ascending or descending. It just simply vanished into thin air."],"Date of the Event":"01/16/2011 09:45 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Windy, Medium","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27427.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27427.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.169657,+-118.599885(27427)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27427) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Other","Case Number":"27427","City":"Los Angeles","Longitude":"-118.599885","Object Shape":"Flash, Other","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.169657","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around January 16th 2011"],"Object Features":"None, Unknown","Log Number":"US-01172011-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
