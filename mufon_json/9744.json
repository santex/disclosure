A few seconds later i see one of the lights reappear and looks as though it was moving up and down and to the side a bit, not abrupt movements but slight ones. Then the second one reappears and a few minutes later the one above it disappears. The second eventually left my view."],"Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9744.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9744.html"]}
