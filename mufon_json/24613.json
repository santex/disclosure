In the 1st photo there are these 2 objects & another 2 at much lower altitude & a bit smaller than these so I zoomed on higher ones . In that photo there's also of what appears a dark square but I don't know how to zoom it in on it to show of what this might be , all these seemed to be far away . I just thought MUFON would like to have a look at the attached close up anyway . I've put an approximate time as since the time of sending in my report a wk. ago of a ufo & a projection by the tree , my camera's internal time clock has been messed up by 2 hrs & don't know of how many minutes . As for my hand watch it took over 24 hrs to get back to it's original ."],"Country":"Canada","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.662986","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Region":"Ontario","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/17/2010 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.662986,+-79.374744(24613)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24613) map </A>","City":"Toronto","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were 4 other sightings in Toronto on or around July 17th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"07/18/2010 01:43 UTC"}
