This occurred about 20-30 miles east of Springfield in southwest Missouri. I was driving in a southeast direction on highway 125 near Sparta, MO towards Oldfield, and saw an oval-shaped brilliantly colored white to silver object towards the north. It was far away so I cannot judge the distance, but what struck me was its rapid speed and unusual movement. The object went from right to left very fast, but then began to turn back in a clockwise fashion so rapidly that I knew it could not be an airplane. Then it just disappeared. I thought I saw a second identical object near the first one but my view became obscured by trees and I had no place to pull over for a better look. It was definitely something I will never forget."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Oval shaped, silver colored shaped UFO zipped around clockwise very rapidly","Date Submitted":"07/12/2012 07:25 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.966213,+-91.827963(40750)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40750) map </A>","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40750.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40750.html"]}
