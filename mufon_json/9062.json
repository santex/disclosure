{"Date of the Event":"03/23/2001 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"9062","divs":["sighting detailsi have been reluctant to tell anyone of this event, as it and i were met with less than a positive reactions when mentioned it at the time. but it has bothered me a great deal ever since. i am a retired chef, at the time of this incident i was driving a cab do to medical problems that would not allow me to continue in my field. i received a call to go to the butte, a small subsection of palmer alaska, to pick up a regular customer. i won't reveal her name as i haven't spoken to her in years and i'm not sure if she would approve. both of us were in our fifty's so we were not young impressionable kids nor were we drinking. { as a cab driver drinking and driving is considered bad form, not to mention against the law.} i was to take my passenger from the butte to a friends home in wassilla, they play cards twice a week, and i chose to go by way of the palmer\\wassilla hy. it is the shortest route. the entire trip should take no longer than twenty mins. it's only about 16 miles. i am sorry about the time and date as its been a while, how ever it was winter and it was just shortly after the a-wac's plane crashed on take off from fort rich. a bit of research should narrow down the time frame. we were enjoying a mild \" warm spell \" [ in alaska thats relative.} the sky's were clear except for some high thin clouds scudding along at a good clip, the moon i believe had set. i was cruising along at about 45 mph and chatting, i knew my passenger well as palmer is a small town and we swapped news of friends and local politics. we had just passed the seward meridian rd. when i saw a very large triangle hanging in the air just off the palmer wassilla hwy. a spot where the terrain slops down into a valley. { to the left, we were going west\\north west.} it { the object} was lower than the mountains to the right of us and absolutely motionless. it made no sound what ever and i rolled down the window just to see if i could hear it. i slowed the cab down to about 25 mph and bent over the wheel to get a better look at it with out wrecking the cab. i called my passengers attention to it. hey, ------, do you see that? oh my god! she replied, aliens are beaming up the palmer dump. she said. i chuckled. but, then it got a bit stranger, i had a 4 million candle power spot on the front seat and was going to stop and shine it up at the thing, partly to see if it would reflect the light and partly hoping it would get a response. i don't know how to explain this. i kept thinking, i'll pull over here and get out, but my mind kept saying, nooo, thats really not a good idea doc. the slower i drove the cab the more insistent the feeling that it wouldn't be \" a good idea \" became. my passenger was also experiencing the same type of feelings. the feelings were so strong that i never did come to a complete stop, but pulled over to the shoulder and kept moving at about 5 mph. the object it's self, besides being very big, was triangular in shape but with volume, [ it was not razor thin. ] the tips at the three axis points glowed brightly, one white one green and one red. [since it was not moving it could not be determined which end\\tip was the leading edge.] the reason i mention the lights is that each tip glowed it's own color in a perfect triangle of it's own, there were no discernible rivets,welds or seams, it was as if the material the thing was made of just glowed from within. the rest of the \"ship\" was a silvery metal like substance, not polished brightly but clearly metallic. the overall impression was of great subtle beauty, the lines flowed with a grace that was very pleasing to the eye, simple but eloquent in it's design. a true work of art. it also was not very reflective, you could see the lights of some of the homes and street lamps reflected in the surface but they were not like in a mirror. we could judge the size pretty well as the hwy. we were on runs along on the top of a moraine and the next hwy. over is clearly visible from there and only 4 miles away and it was not at a very high altitude. [ as mentioned earlier, the mountains to the north are only about 8 miles away and are under 3,000 ft.] the object was at a lower altitude than the mts. it, was large enough to put the wassilla hi school foot ball field and it's parking lot on top of and have enough room left over for a mini market, this thing was big. i have seen a few other pictures of triangle shaped objects but most show a large circular lighted area on the bottom center, this one did not have that feature, the bottom was not lighted just the tips. we could even see a bit of the top where it curved up from the sides so it had to be fairly low. we had it in view for about 15-20 mins. first out of the windshield then out the left side windows before the \" assault \" on our minds became to much for my passenger and i reluctantly drove off to take her to her card party.i have to admit that i broke the law by going over the speed limit by a good bit, [about 65 mph] to get her there and a bit faster going back to see if it was still visible. but it was gone by the time i got back to where i could see past the intervening terrain and trees. i called it in to dispatch, boy was that a mistake, i got the old, \"uh huh\" are you sure your ok to drive bit. i am 62 years old now and the shear size and simple beauty of the thing still haunts me. we have nothing of that size that can, fly, much less hover motionless and silent then disappear with out a trace, [ no fading lites in the sky.] in less than the twelve mins. it took me to get back. and the mind thing, it was as if someone was in my head whispering, no that wouldn't be a good idea, no you really don't want to do that do you? very gentle but effective. [ i didn't stop all the way after all, nor shine my spot light on it.] i am not prone to telling tall tales, [unless i tell you first it's a tall tale.] i am not interested in public attention, on the contrary, i am, like most alaskans a very private person and shun any such thing. but, i would like to know if anyone else has seen a thing like this and if they too were affected in a similar manner. it is also hoped that telling some body of this experience will put it to rest for me. thank you for listening. doc smith"],"Longitude":"-149.439444","Summary":"A large triangeler object w/the tips lighted.
