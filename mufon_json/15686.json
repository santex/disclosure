Then in a split second they disappeared a and reappeared aquarter of the sky distance away at a much lower altitude. The lights stayed motionless pulstating for about 5 minutes, then one flickered out and in it's place 4-5 small lights took it's place. I live near luke airforce base and then I saw 5 fighter jet fly toward the lights. The lights blinked off as the jets came near. One or to of the jets circled and then they all stormed off south as is taking chase. My wife say the Pheonix light in 97 she said this looked very familiar. It was intense to see!!!
