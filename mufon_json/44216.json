I was outside the Physical Sciences building in Pocatello, waiting for my ride. I looked up and saw what looked like what may have been an airplane circling through the clouds. A couple of things that made me believe that it wasn't a plane was there was no sound, it was going in an almost perfect circle, but it's 'orbit' would slightly alter when it would zip slightly. Another thing was that it would drop little lights and the lights would just fade away. It kept it up for the whole time I was there, and when I glanced back I saw it still spinning. I don't know if it's still going, or if it disappeared. It reminded me of the moon behind the clouds, but lighter, and moving constantly. I was a little unnerved when I first saw it. I just stood there, thinking that people who were driving and walking by me were probably thinking I was crazy because I was staring straight up just watching this thing going in a circle, ever so slightly changing it's spin. I posted this on a Facebook page called Pocatello Paranormal Research and found out that this isn't the first time this has been sighted. One of their team saw it, and one of my friend's husband saw it and told her to go out and see it. I hope someone catches some evidence of this anomaly!"],"City":"Pocatello","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44216.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44216.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/28/2012 11:56 UTC","Case Number":"44216","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Summary":"rounded, hazy, spinning in wide circle, slight zipping to alter spin.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.876803,+-112.437184(44216)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44216) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON"}
