(1) the blinking lights the object appeared to be a mass of very small, tightly packed, bright lights. the lights were blinking on and off, in unison, at a rate much faster than commercial airliners. i estimate 5-7 times\\second. i estimate a number greater than 20. i could not count the number due to the small size of the individual lights and the short length of the viewing period. the magnitude of the blinking was consistant for the first 7 seconds or so. it dimmed to nearly invisible within 1\\2 second, regained it's former magnitude for the nest few seconds, then faded and was no longer observable. i estimate that at their maximun brightness, they reached a magnitude 3. (2) the shape the shape was indistinct. i could not tell the depth. the mass of lights appeared as if they were on a single surface. it was not a cloud of lights with a determinate depth. (3) size the size of the mass was about the size of a dime held at arms length. (4) the duration i estimate approx. 10 seconds total. the first seven seconds fully observable, then fading to near invisibility, back to the original magnitude for a few seconds, then fading to invisibility. (5) direction of travel with a ruler held at arms length, (approx. 2'-9\") from the eye, i estimate the mass of lights traveled approx. 6 inches across the sky."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","trends":[],"Region":"California"}
