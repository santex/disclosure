{"divs":["sighting details standing in my house at the window talking on the phone when i first observed the lights. after completing the call i called out to my wife to come and check the lights out. i first noticed them because of the brightness of the lights and the fact that they seemed to be hovering over the trees around a half mile away. we both watched them move very slowly over the trees from the sse then turn very very slowly to the sw and then they disappeared after a few more minutes. when the object turned is when i noticed besides the green, blue, red and white lights there seemed to be 1 blinking white light at the end of what looked like a boomerang or triangle shape. before they disappeard i wanted to go outside and check for some sound but i heard nothing except the neighbor calling for his dog. the object seemed to have a span as wide as a 747 jet and yes i do know my aircraft. we live in a frequent fly zone plus when we were in the military we lived under the flight path of wheeler army airfield. i have to admit that i was dumbfounded as to what i had just seen since i do believe in ufo's but have never seen anything like this. after the object seemed to drift off out of our view (heading towards the village of burlington) i returned to the house. i would say around a 1\\2 hour later we observed and heard a helicopter fly over the lake across the road and fly in the same general direction that he object had flown. the helicopter was not flying at a very high altitude. somewhere in the range of 500ft or so. we do have military helicopters fly over during the ang manuevers but this was a single copter and was moving pretty fast. about a week later i seen another strange object in the sky but will fill out another report for that."],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Burlington","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/29/2012 06:11 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/18/2012 09:10 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.145172,+-85.050249(43600)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43600) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10292012-0017","Longitude":"-85.050249","Latitude":"42.145172","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43600.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43600.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Burlington","Case Number":"43600","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"Bright multicolored lights in boomerang shape No sound moving slowly.","Region":"Michigan","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
