{"Tags":"City","divs":["sighting detailson 5\\14\\2010, at approximately 10:15 pm, i left my workplace. i drove approx 1\\4 mile to the east, to a convenience store to buy a six pack of beer. i paid for six pack, walked out side, got in my car, and as i was pulling out of the parking lot onto the public street, i looked up and saw these two, large pinkish\\red solid lights, flying across the sky. they were emitting a directional light. when i first saw them come out of the southeastern sky, they appeared to be traveling from south to north, and that is when the light emitting from them was the brightest. i pulled across the street into a large mall type parking lot to get a better veiw. i picked up my cell phone and called my place of work where there were other coworkers still there. i told them to go outside and look up at the southern sky. i am not sure if the lights turned or just moved across the sky. but they ended up traveling in a westward direction. i was on the cell phone with my coworkers who were standing in the parking lot, 1\\4 mile from me, watching the event. there were 5 of them. three women, age's 29 to 44. and two men ages 17 and 20. i began driving toward the lights, on the street, and ended up in front of, but across the street from my place of work, with the coworkers standing out side watching the lights. as the lights moved across the sky, the light being emitted from them began to fade, not as in fading from moving farther away, but fading as in the lights were shinning ahead of the two craft. and, it could have been one large craft with a light at each end. the distance between the two lights, was, at arms length, in my vield of view, 5 to 6 inches apart when they were directly due south from me as they moved across the sky. in other words, if i held up a ruler at the end of my arm, the lights would have been 5 to 6 inches apart. as they traveled away to the west, the angle changed as if they were attached to one large object. the lights did not flicker, they did not pulse, they did not strobe. during the event, a commercial jet, apparently flying out of memphis int airport flew over the lights, from west to east. the commercial jet was 4 or 5 times higher in altitude than the lights. the lights finally disappeared to the west,but, the west leading light disapeared maybe 15 or 20 seconds before the rear light. it was a clear night and there were stars out. when i first noticed the object, my first impulse was that it was a helicopter. it was low and moving slow. there was no sound. i turned my car engine off. there was very limited trafic in the area. the movement of the object, was very steady. it did not appear to change altitude. my feelings were that i was actually witnessing a ufo event. at first, i went through the deductive process of what it could be. and then, i realized, it was nothing that i could identify. i had no specific emotion, no fear, some excitement. my coworkers on the phone, however, were doing the \"oh my gosh\" thing. they did not freak out, but they could not believe what they were seeing. i have spent alot of time, over the years, watching the sky. i am pretty familiar with most of what is up there visible to the naked eye. each night, while at work, when i take a break, i go outside and look up at the sky. just in case there is something i need to see. this immediatly reminded me of the phoenix lights incident. i am a very logical solid person. i am college educated and a professional. i dont jump to snap conclusions."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Corinth","There were no other sightings in Corinth on or around May 14th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/15/2010 10:42 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23283.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23283.html"],"Summary":"Two solid pinkish/red large lights traveling southeast to southwest in the southern sky","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Saturn-like, Sphere, Star-like","Latitude":"34.938835","Longitude":"-88.51903","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/14/2010 10:15 UTC","City":"Corinth","Log Number":"US-05152010-0005","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.938835,+-88.51903(23283)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23283) map </A>","Case Number":"23283","Region":"Mississippi"}
