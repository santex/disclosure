I notice a orange light in the distance near the paso bridge. I thought nothing of it but Its a helicopter. The closer I got I noticed it wasnt leaving the area it flew over the amusement park worlds of fun. So I saod to my self it wasnt a helicopter but maybe a plane in the wrong flight pattern. I had others in my vehical that saw the same thing. No one said anything until we got within a mile ththats when we all spoke. It appeared to be like a almond on fire not sure of the speed but it was but it was large coming east to west slow pace no flashing lights but a brightly cover tail"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Blimp, Other","Date Submitted":"02/24/2013 04:37 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in North Kansas City","There were no other sightings in North Kansas City on or around November 3rd 2012"],"Log Number":"US-02242013-0011","Date of the Event":"11/03/2012 05:30 UTC","Object Features":"Dome","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Case Number":"45862","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-94.572978","Region":"Missouri","Latitude":"39.142908","Summary":"glowing aircraft's","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.142908,+-94.572978(45862)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45862) map </A>","City":"North Kansas City","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown"}
