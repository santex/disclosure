{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I were outside on the balcony talking and we spotted a small group of orange lights in the distance approx 3 miles away. It was not moving and looked like it may have had a spotlight or something. Then it moved higher slowly and shot towards our area. It slowed down abruptly and flew overhead. It made no sound...had 3 orange-ish lights and was silent, it was black in color. It was flying at a wierd angle...like it was turning the whole time and I could see the entire bottom of it the entire time it was overhead, but it was going straight. It flew off to the SW."],"City":"Overland Park","Date Submitted":"09/08/2012 10:19 UTC","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Overland Park","There were no other sightings in Overland Park on or around September 8th 2012"],"Longitude":"-94.691253","Summary":"spotted orange lights, not moving, then moved very fast within 2 miles, flew overhead no sound triangle shaped, black.","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42393.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42393.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Region":"Kansas","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"38.912952","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.912952,+-94.691253(42393)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42393) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09082012-0019","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/08/2012 08:35 UTC","Case Number":"42393"}
