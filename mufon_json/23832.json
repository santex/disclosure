I dont kno why but i turned around away from porch and noticed a light which at first thought was a airplane but quickly realized it was not. I am a trained storm spotter and never have seen anything like this. Was about 25 to 30 degrees from ground level coming from the SE traveling NW. It was a quater or more in size at arm length, yellowish center with a glowing red aura. It traveled around the edge of the storm. Watched it as it banked right and could tell it was an object just not the shape. The light did not bounce or penetrate through clouds. After it had went from sight I had chils and chil bumps.. Cold.. need less to say its 85 and humid. Also the lighting seemed to have diminished significantly."],"City":"Hot Springs","Case Number":"23832","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"06/20/2010 12:51 UTC","Tags":"City"}
