{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Wiggins","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn the early morning of July 4, 2011, on the South side of Jackson State Park Resovoir is a private R.V. community, approximately 15 people were sitting outside and witnessed a bright red ufo that appeared to be two balls one on top of each other, it proceeded to the North and faded out of sight, aproximately 5 minutes later it appeared again in the North site for a moment. One of our party who was not present, showed shortly after this and he said he was walking on the main road leading into the park and had seen the object as well. After discussing what he saw, me and 4 other people went to the road to see if we could see anything else. We went up to the road and after we had been their for a short time, my fiance looking toward the South saw another bright red object approaching, we had a clear view of the the sky from the north to the south and the object flew directly over us at aproximately 12,000 feet, having viewed commerical jet liners and military air craft in flight, I estimated it was traveling a aproximately 1200 miles per hour due to the time it took it to travel across the entire horizon, it was bright ruby red and when directly above us appeared almost crystaline with difused red light waves around it. After it faded off in the distance, some minutes later while watching to see if we could see anything further, we saw to objects the at first appeared to be stars moving in a synchonise manner off to the north as well, they were white balls and where about the same luminosity as the stars appearing behind them. After this we went to the lakeshore and were on the south west side of the lake and saw a bright white light over the lake as we watched it moved toward the North east and faded out of sight very quickly. I served 4 years in the USAF and have seen numerous aircraft both at night and during the day in flight and what I saw was like nothing I have seen before. I have had two other sightings in my life and this was the most intense and clear cut, that and with the other witnesses that were with me has led me to know beyond all certainty that we are not alone in the universe and our government is lying to us and it is the greatest conspiracy in the world. If only we would have had a video camera. The other sightings I have had were outside of Grand Junction Colorado in 1997 were I saw a triangular green ufo that was hovering over a ranch and that followed me car for about 20 miles and in Ellettsville, In. in 1987 I saw a huge glowing orange red ball of light as well.h"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30012.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30012.html"],"Summary":"ruby red ufo flys over Jackson State Park","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Colorado","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-104.072728","Date Submitted":"07/06/2011 02:09 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/04/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"30012","Log Number":"US-07062011-0007","Latitude":"40.230536","Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.230536,+-104.072728(30012)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30012) map </A>","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wiggins","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
