I noticed as I was scanning the sky, off to the South thier was a bright starlike object, it was moving from the West to the East,I ran back inside to get my flashlight and tell the hubby and daughter. Im standing outside flashing at this thing (probbly looking like a nut case) and it turns off its course of direction and is coming straight towards me, it gets right above me and hovers for about a minute,we are all amazed that the flashlight thing worked, we saw it on some TV show being done, the hubby and daughter were telling me to get inside, I told them no and that I wanted to know what it was, thier screaming at me that Im going to get abducted, at about that time it started to go up, and as it did it turned from a glowing starlike object to a redish-orange sphere and went straight up very fast and was gone. I have to be honest, I was scared to death standing there, and the family sceaming that Im going to be abducted,but something is going on and I want to get to the bottom of it."],"City":"Mt.
