We both noticed in the southeast sky a glowing orange object traveling at a high rate of speed. The object continued to travel in a northwesterly direction on a level flight path and when it was some distance from us it ascended at high rate speed and then it would vanish from sight. There was a total of 8 objects observed and they would appear in five minute intervals along the same flight path. These object made no sound and did not display any air craft marker lights. The duration of each sighting lasted approximately five to ten seconds. No video or photographic was attained at the time of the events."],"Log Number":"US-07052013-0021","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 10:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48645.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Kansas","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 03:09 UTC","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"48645","Latitude":"39.013742","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-98.481046","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Ariel sighting","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
