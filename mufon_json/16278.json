I was driving a transport truck returning home from Maine, USA I was the only truck on the road at 330 am on June 17th 1997 when this ship came up from behind me and flew over top of the truck just ahead of me. I checked all around to be sure i was not seeing things i wasn't. The ship was as wide as the two lane hwy. it was mostly the color of mercury with red neon in the middle and almost shaped like a football but as it got near the rear it turned into two points with the red neon in the center. The ship appeared to have its own light source or appeared to give a light that didnt shine it was as if it was its own light. This lasted approx. 3-5 mins and at one point the ship banked up towards the sky at about 45 degree angle and in the blink of an eye i could hardly see it anymore and then it was gone."],"Longitude":"-65.499479","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"Canada","Object Flight Path":"Other","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
