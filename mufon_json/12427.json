{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"48.890123","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/07/2008 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was up on a logging road near Church Mtn with my friend and we found a vista of Mt. Baker and stopped to gawk at the awesome beauty of Mt. Baker. I took four longshot pics of my friend standing in front of some trees with Mt Baker in the near distance. I was focussed on trying to get a good picture of her and wasn't looking at the sky. When I got home and downloaded the pics off my Olympus camera I noticed five orbs and a disc in one of the shots. None of the other pics taken within one minute showed any anomalies. It wasn't dust on the cam or there would have been similar objects in other pics...The attached pics are cropped from the original photo since my friend isn't here and I didnt know if she would want me to include her in this report. The first is normal, the second a de-enhanced gamma (MS phot editor) and third is a negative edit."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.890123,+-121.945702(12427)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12427) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"12427","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12427.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12427_submitter_file1__2ufoP9070289.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12427_submitter_file2__denhancedgamma(MSPhEd)2ufoP9070289.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12427.html"],"City":"Glacier","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Glacier","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-121.945702","Summary":"one of four portrait/landscape pics shows odd aerial activity","Object Shape":"Disc","Log Number":"US-09112008-0005","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Washington","Date Submitted":"09/07/2008 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
