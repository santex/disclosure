This time it was a bit more discreet and more of a white color. I noticed it while outside (around 8:30p PST) and couldn't help but see the slow movement of what appeared to be a star. I returned to the comfort of the inside of my house. I went back outside at approximately 10p PST and the object was still in the sky, but directly above my house when I looked up. I went under the eve of my house and poked my head back out and the object appeared to be following me in the sky. It moved directly above me while standing outside and I could see it when I went inside the house too. I am a bit nervous, because I feel like it was watching me. Like it could see me from above. Upon further investigation, looking at through binoculars showed me that it was indeed in our atmosphere and not a star phenomenon. The object seemed to be moving with me in the sky."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"27218","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.220654,+-122.001978(27218)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27218) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/03/2011 01:38 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Log Number":"US-01032011-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27218.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27218.html"]}
