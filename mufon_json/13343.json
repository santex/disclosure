It was after 11pm cst but not yet 11:30. My dog was lingering in a parking lot so I looked up as I often do to observe the stars. I saw what I thought was a plane without it's landing lights on. I thought that was strange because I expected the dimmer lights to be red and green for port and starboard. They were orangish and the craft never made any noise at all! It moved in a straight line over downtown Dallas at an almost due south direction; slightly east. I watched for 20 minutes for other crafts or for it to return and saw nothing. It was larger than the little dipper which was also in the south east sky."],"Latitude":"32.810785","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-96.764173","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There was one other sighting in Dallas on or around October 28th 2008"],"Date of the Event":"10/28/2008 11:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
