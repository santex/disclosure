First four, then five then six. They moved in different directions most moving west but four moved into a straight line then apart pairing off two different pairs each moving close to each other then apart. Sometimes not moving. A plane flew by at the same time and appeared to be flying below the orbs. Finally only two visible after about 20-30 minutes. No sound, and moving with deliberation not blowing or drifting. Completely baffled as to what they were, we were excited and a little frightened."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
