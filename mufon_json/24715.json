{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was coming home from a friends house and the sky looked particularly cool tonight with the cloud formations present. I stopped at home, and normally I would just get out of the car and head inside but something stopped me and I just looked at the moon, adoring it, when I noticed what seemed to be a constellation of 4 or 5 \"stars\" directly under the moon, which I had never noticed before. I focused on them and as I was looking they seemed to get \"closer\", or \"bigger\", and moved around a little bit. I had the feeling inside that I was witnessing something amazing, almost to the point of crying. They eventually faded away to the point where I couldn't see them anymore, just the moon. What were they and where did they go? They were not really bright, in comparison to say... jet lights or plane lights, but they were putting off some form of light."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Log Number":"US-07222010-0019","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"24715","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Williamsport","Date of the Event":"07/22/2010 11:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24715.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24715.html"],"Longitude":"-76.994199","Summary":"Four \"stars\" near the moon that got slightly closer and brighter then faded away","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.24578,+-76.994199(24715)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24715) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/22/2010 11:10 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"41.24578","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Williamsport","There were no other sightings in Williamsport on or around July 22nd 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City"}
