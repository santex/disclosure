I let my dogs out in the front yard to do their thing and I look up in the NW sky towards and I see solidly lit red and green object in the sky at about 8-10 miles distance making IMPOSSIBLE stop and go lateral and vertical movements in complete silence and for no reason in the sky, in the middle of an international traffic route coming in from the western Pacific over the U.S.. This went on for about 1 minute before I went inside and got Denise to witness it. It then went on performing maneuvers for another 2 minutes after that. This thing was showing off in the sky, in the middle of a traffic route instantly rising and falling below that route. I never seen anything like it ever. I'm looking skyward at night because the skies are full of planes around here but it's all controlled airspace."],"Log Number":"US-10012013-0001","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"09/30/2013 07:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"I look up in the NW sky towards and I see solidly lit red and green object in the sky at about 8-10 miles distance making IMPOSSIBLE stop and go lateral and vertical movements","Case Number":"51227","City":"Los Angeles","Object Shape":"Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.987954,+-118.326416(51227)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51227) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/01/2013 12:07 UTC"}
