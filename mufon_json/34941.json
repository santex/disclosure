Above one cloud - diagonally to the right of the sun - a spot of bright light appeared. It seemed to shine brighter than an airplane and it did not move for the five minutes I observed it. My camera could not focus on it particularly well and I was also so astonished that I forgot, for the most part, to turn on auto focus. The object eventually blinked out and it started to snow."],"Longitude":"-78.648794","Date Submitted":"01/18/2012 10:03 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Latitude":"37.436883","Summary":"Object Reflecting Light From Sun - Stationary for 5 Minutes - Faded Away","Region":"Virginia","Log Number":"US-01182012-0019","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.436883,+-78.648794(34941)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34941) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":[""]}
