{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were waiting for fireworks to start. there were probably 2000 or so people there. we were looking southwest. my three friends who were with me and i saw a reddish orange sphere appear to the south. if i had to guess, i would say it was 10, 15 thousand ft high, probably 35 degrees off the horizon. it slowly moved toward us, maybe a few miles in 5 seconds. it stopped, grew brighter, more intense. it was about 5 or 6 times larger than a star. it stayed stationary for 20 or thirty seconds, varying in intensity. it then drifted away slowly, the direction it came from, about the same distance, then darted east. it moved 3 or 4 miles in less than a second, then seemed to fade away."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-79.701988","Log Number":"US-07042011-0024","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29922.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29922.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"07/04/2011 11:46 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/03/2011 09:50 UTC","Case Number":"29922","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hopwood","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Summary":"reddish orange light appears, maneuvers, disappears","City":"Hopwood","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.87702,+-79.701988(29922)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29922) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"39.87702","Source":"MUFON"}
