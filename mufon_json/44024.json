We traveled on foot, down a trail, and we walked deep into the forest reserve. It was almost dawn, and visibility was rather low. All of a sudden, we both heard an unknown humming noise, that had a pulsating sound effect, that traveled swiftly right above our heads. We didn't see the object, however, I am in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, and I never witnessed such a sound from an aircraft. Later that week, other witnesses, reported their sightings to our local news station, WJAR NBC10. An unknown object, was seen around the Cranston area. There is a photo of this UFO, posted in their website. I am not crazy, and this event is something that just happened to us, that I can't explain. I felt so strongly about this ordeal, that I decided to reach out to MUFON."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.498567,+-71.662769(44024)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44024) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/19/2012 09:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"41.498567","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"44024","Date of the Event":"11/12/2012 05:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
