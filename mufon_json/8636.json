{"divs":["Sighting Detailswhen i first started seeing ufo's regularly (last May) the first thing I thought of was the prophet yahwey, so as soon as i was able to speak to them, I asked them about the so called prophet yahwey, and they told me he was a liar, and used them for his own financial gain and that the true God is within all of us and the only one who will ever judge us is ourselves. So don't be fooled by a false prophet that can no longer summon our friends from another world. Just ask him to summon them. He won't be able to. But you probably can because the want you to help stop the false prophet."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.840443,+-117.910554(8636)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8636) map </A>","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-12192007-0005","Object Shape":"Egg","Case Number":"8636","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Anaheim","There were no other sightings in Anaheim on or around December 19th 2007"],"Longitude":"-117.910554","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/19/2007 11:25 UTC","Summary":"the balloons told me they don't speak to the prophet yahwey anymore and that he lied to them","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/19/2007 11:25 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.840443","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8636.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8636.html"],"City":"Anaheim"}
