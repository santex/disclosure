As the object came closer overhead, there was no noticable sound, and clearly no other lights as a plane or helicopter would have. This object moved south to north, slowly, and eminated the same color green light the entire time. No flashing, no radiating, just green. My two children 7 and 4, both saw the same thing, the older of the two asked me what the light was. I had no explanation. It took roughly 3 minutes for the object to travel out of view."],"Object Shape":"Oval","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.431489,+-118.470118(30047)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30047) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07072011-0017"}
