I saw what looked like a B29 Bomber hovering above the back field about 200 feet from me at about 45���. I was awe struck, amazed and a bit freaked out to see this plane hovering for more than 5 minutes. I saw the four propellers turning but it was silent. It was a dark gray in tone with no markings. After about 6 minutes I became board, thinking to myself to leave, just then it began to move forward very slowly. I watched for a couple more minutes as it moved about twice it's length. I would be late for work so I got back in my car and headed down the road. About a quarter mile down the road I stopped again, perplexed. I figured the plane would be seen again after I lost view of it over a small wooded lot that obstructed my view. I never appeared on the other side of the woods. I passed it off as some sort of new military plane. I didn't know then that they had retired those planes in the 1960s. It has bugged me for years. I often wonder if I was experiencing some time warp. or maybe an alien encounter. I recently heard someone else call into Coast to Coast AM and report a similar incident that happened to them in Illinois. Theres was a cargo plane with propellers, silent, but theirs was said to be somewhat transparent. My plane was solid. I do recall that. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to report my experience."],"Log Number":"US-03302008-0003","Longitude":"-85.555637","Object Features":"Window(s), Wings","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Grand Rapids Charter Township","There were no other sightings in Grand Rapids Charter Township on or around July 31st 1979"],"Date of the Event":"07/31/1979 10:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.939382","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"B-29 Bomber Hovering","City":"Grand Rapids Charter Township","Case Number":"10097","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Michigan","Country":"United States"}
