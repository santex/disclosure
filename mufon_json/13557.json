Eventually we contacted Nypd, and coast guard, both of whom responded. I have a story around their search but there's no way I.m typing it. The ufo was in the story for only about 6-8 minutes, and was in fact just a flying blur, but it absolutely powered itself into the water. If your interested feel free to call or em. It's an interesting evnt, actually made the NY Post, although they do not mention a downed ufo. I could easily locate the other chaps if need be. Thank You."],"Case Number":"13557","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/13/1992 11:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-11062008-0004","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13557.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13557.html"]}
