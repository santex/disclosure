It was seen by multiple people in the area and was captured by many onlookers I think. People were stopping in the street to look at it. I filmed this using my cellphone camera so its grainy. (sorry I know they are always grainy!) But this thing hovered around then zipped away. It looked like it had tentacles on it or something."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
