It was shooting up and down , back and forth, even did what looked like a flip. Then would randomly disapare then came back. Made a call on my cell phone and suddenly loss power in it, then my car started to lose power and then I seen the UFO again. Then power suddenly came back. Then pulled in a gas station to take a picture and my phone shut off and wouldn't power back up until the thing shot off again. People were talking about it in the station. Called my parents and they turned the police scanner on and there was talk of it. Several area residents home and phone services went down randomly . I'm unsure as to how long."],"Date of the Event":"02/08/2012 05:42 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35572.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35572.html"],"Summary":"Glowing triangle in the sky","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Illinois","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Bellevue","Case Number":"35572","Longitude":"-89.658351","Latitude":"40.681114","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bellevue","There was one other sighting in Bellevue on or around February 8th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.681114,+-89.658351(35572)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35572) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-02082012-0013","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
