I had one ���Easy Street��� micro brew beer with lunch hours ago. I was looking to the north. Sky was overcast. I saw what I can only state was the brightest ���flash��� of an object that I have ever seen. The flash was quite large, as I estimate the distance of the object to be over 10 miles and the diameter of the flash was close to 100 meters. There was also a smaller flash that was just as bright within about 50 meters from the larger flash. The smaller flash was about one quarter the size of the larger one. The object was to the north at about 35 degrees from the horizon. This was not an aircraft that had caught the last reflection of sunset, as I have seen this before and the energy (radiance) was much larger than anything the sun could produce, and the photopic spectral sensitivity, while in the 600 nm range, was multiples larger than anything that a reflected sunset would produce. I can only guess that this must have been either a meteor coming into our atmosphere, which broke up into two pieces, or a manmade object coming into our atmosphere. There was no tail to indicate an object burning up in our upper atmosphere. Otherwise this is an unknown. I am writing because I would like to know if anyone else had seen this object and can aid me in getting another point to plot from. I am a member of MUFON, and this is the first object I have ever seen that I cannot identify.
