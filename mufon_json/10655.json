IN A CLEARING I SAW A WHITE OBJECT,ABOUT FIVE FEET TALL AND 3 FEET WIDE GENTLY BOUCING UP AND DOWN, BUT WAS ABOUT 1 FOOT ABOVE THE GROUND. I STOP AND LOOKED BACK AT MY FRIEND AND SHE STOPPED THE SAME TIME AS I STARING AT THE OBJECTS THEN REALIZING THERE WERE 2 OF THEM. WE WATCHED THEM STAYING IN THE SAME POSITION BOUCING UP AND DOWN THEN THEY MOVED SIDEWAYS INTO THE WOODS' WE DECIDED TO RIDE DOWN AND INVESTIGATE AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING. THE NEXT DAY I RETURN ALONE AND RODE DOWN THE SAME TRAIL BUT ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE ORIDGINAL SIGHTING WE SAW THE DAY BEFORE THERE WAS A SHIP. IT WAS ABOUT 20FEET FROM THE TRAIL IN THE WOODS. IT WAS CAMOFLAGED, 10 FEET IN RADIUS AND I STILTS ABOUT 6 FEET TALL.
