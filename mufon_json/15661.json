{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[""],"Object Features":"None","divs":["sighting details i was at my cousins house, it was 2:05am, and i couldn't sleep. it was storming outside, and there were a few lights on in the hallway. there was a large, square fan across the floor from my bed, with a sliding glass window facing a dirt road and woods. the fan was on, and then, with a flash of lightening, and a boom of thunder, everything turned off, and became quiet. no crickets, no fan, i couldn't even hear my cousins breathing. the power had turned off, and i felt something was wrong, so i looked at the window, and saw a faint glowing\\shiny white light. getting up to investigate, i crossed the carpeted floor, and stood to the left of a large, dusty wooden bunk-bed, with the fan that had previously had power on high, now on my left side. as i watched, i saw to orbs shoot out of the woods, and leave a trail of light, sort of like the aurora boreas, but they illuminated two trees that they had passed. they started to come up to the window, and quickly, not knowing if it was a dream or not, i looked around for what i could look for when, if i woke up, as evidence of this encounter. placing my right hand on the dusty bunk-bed, i made sure to leave three distinct fingerprints in the thick layer of dust. assuming it wouldn't be enough, i grabbed the fan, and turned it diagonally to the right, while moving the switch which still read high, to off. all the while seeing the two orbs hovering outside of the window. i darted a glance to the road, for headlights sometimes came up it at night, but there were no cars, when suddenly i heard a strange melody. it was almost like a humpback whale's song, only more soothing, like a lullaby. it filled my head, making everything seem like it was coated in a soft, white haze. my confusion sort of melted away, leaving a peaceful calm in it's wake, but my heart sped up so fast, it felt like it would explode out of my chest. the orbs just hovered, but slowly, unwittingly, i felt myself pulling away from the window, but i wasn't done quite yet. there was a camera on the table that held the fan, and quickly i grabbed it, but as soon as i did, they left, swinging in a brilliant arc upwards and back into the woods, leaving that trail of light, like a comet of sorts. quickly i went back to bed, the melody still ringing in my ears. the next morning, i woke up with the song still there, but this time it was words. they were of a foreign language, one that i had never heard before, but i remember those words, so strange, yet still understood: \"'watch for the red jeep'\". before anything else, i got out a pen and some paper, and drew a picture of what i had seen, and took time to check my markings. everything was as it had been when i had moved it the night before. only, there were two burn marks on the glass. not dark, but still visible, they were placed where the orbs had been. we had taken a picture, but no matter what the camera, the marks didn't show. they weren't there, only visible to the naked eye. i told my cousin of the events, and she laughed and threatened to put me in the hospital. i told her husband, and he was indifferent, but offered to have me show him the evidence. he studied the burns, and then we took a trip to the wooded area, where the lights had shown on the bark, there too were burns. he wasn't sure what it meant, but he then believed me. to this day, i often see them outside of my window, on a dark, stormy night. they still have a melody, but every time i hear it, it means something else. they visit me on the exact same day and time as the did the first encounter. as to the jeep, a few days later i had a dream about one, which proceeded to become true while my family was driving. my mom hit a red jeep, but i had told her to hit her brakes before i really knew what was going to happen. they don't seem aggressive, actually, they seem like they are trying to communicate, to get help."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Tags":"City","Summary":"Two floating white/shining orbs, left trail of light that faded, like glass balls.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.324224,+-85.600584(15661)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15661) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:15:12","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"07/18/2008 02:05 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"44.324224","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15661.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15661.html"],"Log Number":"US-02222009-0015","Country":"United States","Region":"Michigan","Date of the Event":"07/18/2008 02:05 UTC","Longitude":"-85.600584","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Case Number":"15661"}
