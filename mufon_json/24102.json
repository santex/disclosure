The object glowing blue would dart in all directions then hover motionless and slowly turn to a single bright red dot of light. From my experience in the army airborne I estimated the altitude to go between 1200 and 1800 ft very rapidly. The object would drift or decend at various speed below the tree tops. I have additional photos other than the ones I presented..notice the stars in the back ground..photos were taken with a hand held Dimyage E 500 Konica Minolta."]}
