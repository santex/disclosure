{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-10232013-0015","Country":"Canada","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out running an errand at the local grocery store at a mall along Champlain boulevard in Ville LaSalle in Montreal Canada. When I had finished and was leaving to get into my car I noticed the sun with the usual chemtrails blocking it and decided to take a photo of it. I did not notice the orb until I opened the photo on my desktop when I got home. The photo was crooked so I straightened it. I don't know what it is, wish I would have noticed it at the time I took the photo, but I did not want to look directly into the sun."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51776.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51776_submitter_file1__sphereinacloud.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51776.html"],"Longitude":"-73.59741","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"51776","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Montreal","There were no other sightings in Montreal on or around October 23rd 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"10/23/2013 09:55 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.437763,+-73.59741(51776)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51776) map </A>","Summary":"took a photo of the sun behind clouds, contrails, chemtrails noticed it at home","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Montreal","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Sphere","Region":"Quebec","Date of the Event":"10/23/2013 04:10 UTC","Latitude":"45.437763"}
