{"Log Number":"US-06082011-0011","divs":["sighting detailsthere are 2 stars in the night sky very close together and can be seen by looking up and to the south a little. one is brighter than the other. seen about 10pm in st louis missouri. one is in a 1 oclock position in relation to the other. the distance between them changes over a period of 1 or 2 months. they cant be a planet in out solar system because they would not take that long to change position. also they cannot be stars as they would not change positions or distance to each other for many years or hundreds of years. if they are not planets or stars can anyone tell me what they are and if they can see them through a telescope what are they? thanks very much. {name deleted move to evidence section{fg [email removed\\cms\\tg]"],"Longitude":"-90.192894","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.629892,+-90.192894(29457)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29457) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29457.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29457.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.629892","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Missouri","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"06/08/2011 01:51 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"29457","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in St Louis","There were no other sightings in St Louis on or around June 8th 2011"],"Summary":"two unusual stars","City":"St Louis","Date of the Event":"06/08/2011 10:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
