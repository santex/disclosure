It was a large disc , I could not stop from watching this disc ,I was trying in my head to come up with an excuse to what it was'nt but I knew it was not a ballon , because it would be floting away , This disc just stood very still , part of it I would say less than half was in the cloud , I wanted to reach out to my friends and have them look up but as I was about to do so The disc began to move perfectly straight up until It was so small it disapeared ! I remember it was a flat silver or grey disc, as soon as it was gone I asked my friends if they saw it , then we stood there talking about it while looking up in case the disk returned . I will never forget !"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"San Lorenzo","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-25.350349,+-57.511051(29292)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29292) map </A>"}
