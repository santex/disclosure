{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailsabove time is only a possibility. this took place in the summer\\early fall of either 1977, 78 or 79. however, i'm sure the time was 11 pm to midnight. my husband and i lived in a very rural area of souther humboldt county ca, on elk ridge, about 3 miles from briceland ca. we had a house on a 40 acre parcel, no one else closer than that. we slept in the summer in an outside bed next to house, 360 degree view of sky, watched sky every night going to bed (so i'm very familiar with normal phenomena in the sky). one night, my husband was already asleep, but i was still watching stars, glasses on, extremely clear night, absolutely no chance of optical illusion. i noticed coming from the nnw, a red point of light. if it had not been moving, i would have thought it was a star. i knew it was not an airplane (moving too fast, no sound), a meteor (i've seen those, no tail), a shooting star (came steadily in an arc, not falling, maintained constant elevation, but was about as fast as a falling star) or the satillite we saw every now and then (faster, red, satillite is white). i drew an imaginary line in the sky, projecting its path to go right between the gap in the milky way. it did that, just after passing thru the gap, it made a rt angle turn more or less westerly and then disappeared in an instant. it all happened so fast i couldn't think to wake my husband to see it. what made me first notice the object was its motion. i would have looked at an airplane as well, but then i was riveted by how fast it was going. when i first noticed it i knew immediately it was nothing i'd ever seen before. could not see any particulars of it, no shape, pt of light only, bright red, redder than mars. constant motion until it turned. i did not have time to react before it was gone, but the instant it disappeared, my heart gave a huge jump, adrenalin shot all thru me, fight or flight reaction, knees weak. i grabbed my husband and shook him awake and was so excited i could barely tell him what happened. it took me hours to get to sleep and i've been avid about ufos ever since. i saw them again 20 years later, i assume you want me to file that separatley and i will right now."],"Summary":"rapid moving red pt of light approached me, when overhead, made at speed rt angle turn, then disappeared","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-01202008-0030","Longitude":"-123.78916","Date of the Event":"07/31/1977 11:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.102103,+-123.78916(9096)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9096) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9096.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9096.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/31/1977 11:00 UTC","City":"Garberville","Case Number":"9096","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Garberville","There were no other sightings in Garberville on or around July 31st 1977"],"Tags":"City","Region":"California","Latitude":"40.102103"}
