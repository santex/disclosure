{"City":"Salisbury","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at work at a wilderness camp for troubled boys,and my job required me to be outside at night.The group of boys were in a camp site about 75 yards from where I was,near a small lake on the property.I was in clear view of the nighttime sky panoramically from the north to the east and to the south.The western sky was behind me,and was obscured by the woods,where the boys and their counselors slept.My job was nighttime \"security\".Around 2 a.m., I noticed a blinking light.I didnt think much about it.Thought it was a plane in and out of Douglas Int'l in Charlotte.This traffic was always obvious.Some 10-15 minutes later,I noticed that this blinking whitish light was STILL THERE,SAME PLACE---HAD NOT MOVED---so...I began to watch it.Some 20 minutes later,this blinking light still hadnt moved.So I started timing the interval between flashes with my watch.Every 19 seconds it would blink on and take about 1 or 2 seconds to dim to black.This went on for a good 25 minutes more,and then it started to move,from its SSE position to my right.Very slowly,it took some 15 more minutes to cross the distance of my fist,held up to the sky for reference in my line of sight,now directly due east in front of me,from one star to another,and I totally forgot to note which constellations it was in,near or moving across during its movement.Then as it was moving,still taking 19 second sequences,it stopped.Did not see it any more,saw nothing else of any interest for the rest of the night. Now, I know what planes look like in the night sky,they MUST MOVE,even helos dont do this,and there was no noise at any time during the event.I also know the difference between satelites that seemingly tumble across the sky catching light as it goes or turning into shadow as they move along.I am a Navy veteran,and a trained observer,after working as a correctional officer,and security work,(of which I recently reported another incident involving \"golden lights turning to red and zipping off\"in front of my position.)Again Im not saying it was anything but a light that demonstrated some different manuevers than I'm used to seeing.I felt a little \"uneasy\" almost \"scared\" as I watched this this light do all but nothing much but do its wierd little motion,or lack there of......"],"Log Number":"US-03012009-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"35.678773","Longitude":"-80.467726","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Salisbury","There were no other sightings in Salisbury on or around March 15th 2007"],"Region":"North Carolina","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15779.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15779.html"],"Case Number":"15779","Sighting Duration":"01:45:00","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/15/2007 02:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.678773,+-80.467726(15779)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15779) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/15/2007 02:30 UTC","Summary":"Noticed stationary light in the SSEastern sky,blinking every 19 seconds,until it moved slowly away and disappeared.","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like"}
