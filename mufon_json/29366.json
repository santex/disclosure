{"Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"05/31/1947 09:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting Details(name deleted)fg & I were walking in St. by side of our house when we saw a green and orange fireball pass from S. to N. over a low ridge and dissappeared (no sound and no fire) into the side of the Mt.to the east of us. We thought we had seen a meteor, but the angle of flight was almost zero (Flat trajectory). The lack of sound and fire was also mysterious. A few days later(???), (I was ten years old and ready to start the 5th grade in Sept.) I was awakened early one morning (it was just starting to get light) Looking over to the door in my bedroom, (they were extra tall because the previous owner was 6'10' tall.) I saw a gray human like shape at least as tall as the door, standing just inside the doorway. I was unable to speak for perhaps 30 seconds. Then I Called \"Dad, Dad\", but the words were hardly loud enough for me to hear, I had the thought that I was asleep and I had a bad dream. Quickly, looking at the creature, I pulled the covers over my head and looked out a peephole I made and the object was gone - no sound. I had to keep this quiet for fear my friends would think me crazy. I've kept this secret until I retired from defense work for fear I would lose my S. clearance. If you would like I could provide a topo-map showing the approximate path of the object. I've been retired since 2004 but now I'm writing Christian Literature. These books are given free of charge to my students.
