It looked very different to me so I grabbed my binoculars out of my car to look at it closer. This \"object\" was shaped as a cigar, all lit up like a light bulb in color. There were no blinking lights like an airplane has. I stared at this for 10 minutes trying to figure out what it is. It slowly moved across the sky, heading North-East. All of a sudden it stopped for about 3 minutes at a stand still. With my binoculars glues to my eyes, I stood in one spot staring at this weird thing not moving in the sky. All of a sudden, it took off, with an enormous amount of speed, into the clear dark sky. I stood there waiting for it to come back but it never did."],"Region":"Maine","Case Number":"26224","Sighting Duration":"07:25:00","Object Shape":"Cigar","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cornish","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"43.80472","Log Number":"US-10302010-0013","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","City":"Cornish","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"10/28/2010 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-70.80167","Tags":"City","Summary":"All lit up like a light bulb, slow pace, no blinking lights like a plane, No sound, going North-East then disappeared very fast.","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.80472,+-70.80167(26224)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26224) map </A>"}
