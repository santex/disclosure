It was no more than a few hundred feet up and almost directly above the house. As I was watching it, I was trying to think of what it could be. There was aircraft noise but as soon as the airplane that was nearby passed, it was silent. I stood there watching it for a good while. No noise, nothing coming out of it. It was hovering and twisting in and around itself as it did so. It did this for about 7 minutes when it seemed to all clump together and it started heading upwards. As it was going up, it lit up in bright white lights. It hovered for about a minute or two longer and then suddenly disappeared. I'm a believer in UFO's and I have seen some anomalous activity before but never in daylight and never so close. It was amazingly clear to the naked eye and I can imagine I wasn't the only one to have seen it. I don't know how long it had been there as it had just caught my eye while I was outside. I tried to capture it on my cheap phone but got nothing. I wanted to run into the house to get my camcorder but I remembered that my camcorder battery was dead and I had no idea where my girlfriend's camera was. I texted her right away to tell her what I was witnessing. She told me to get her camera but I was hesitant to go looking for it because I was amazed at what I was witnessing and didn't want to miss one second of it. Now that I didn't capture it, I'm a greatly disappointed because it was amazing and wish I had something to back up my story other than just my own retelling."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.989109,+-118.023554(17636)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17636) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17636.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17636.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/23/2009 08:23 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-06242009-0001","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"Shape-shifting UFO.","Date Submitted":"06/23/2009 08:23 UTC"}
