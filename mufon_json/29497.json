Periodically, a laser which was also white in color would be coming from said aircraft. During this sighting, two helicopters close together flew overhead and they were close to the ground and loud. The aircraft was flying exactly north as was the direction of the laser pointed in the northern direction. The object emitted the laser, it flew in the northern direction, and was often blocked by clouds as it was an overcast. I was right outside of our house, my mom was outside smoking when she and he noticed the aircraft. Upon first glance, they assumed it to be a star. My mom and her boyfriend were very shocked at the object and they were trying to get me to see it. We lost sight of the object as it moved behind the clouds."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Hanover","Date Submitted":"06/11/2011 11:47 UTC","Latitude":"39.803835","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/11/2011 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hanover","There were no other sightings in Hanover on or around June 11th 2011"],"Summary":"Triangular aircraft with three lights and a laser","Country":"United States"}
