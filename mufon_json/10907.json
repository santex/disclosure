Our perspective of this event was from Knolls Crescent in the Spuyten Duyvil section of the Bronx in NYC. I pointed the star out to my girlfriend stating \"wow look how bright that star is\" she agreed. I then told my girlfriend that the object was \"too bright to be just a star\" and that it was \"probably a planet\". Suddenly, the object flashed and grew to an enormous white light (aproximately 10X its original size), then the light just vanished and we both saw a small object moving from the sight where the light had been due west before vanishing into the night sky."]}
