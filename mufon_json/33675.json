We were traveling North up highland drive about 115 south and 1600 East(appx). I seen the object hovering a couple hundred feet above houses to my left. There were 3 lights in a triangle. At first I thought it was those lights on power lines. My wife who's a total skeptic noticed them and said \"what the hell is that?\". I noticed that it was kind of moving. I pulled over shut off my truck and lights. We got out and watched as it hovered vertically, then it appeared to move horizontally then it just slowly flew straight away until it was gone. It never made a sound."],"Longitude":"-111.853115"}
