It was due west. I have seen similar things before but were unable to get a really good look at it with the binoculars I have. We have been admiring the clear moon images the last few nights. He noticed the object and pointed out that it was displaying many colors. I used the railing to stabilize the binoculars and got a really good look at it. It was indeed displaying different colors that were not FAA identifiers. Just as in the past, this object appeared to be stationary but my recollections in the past have been that it gets lower in the sky as the night progresses. It is still visible. He will be up late so he will continue to observe. it is now 10:43 PM."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-94.666295","Region":"Kansas","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"multi-colored lights in western night sky.","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Mission","There was one other sighting in Mission on or around April 5th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38484.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38484.html"],"City":"Mission","Date of the Event":"04/05/2012 10:05 UTC","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"38484","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-05242012-0016","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.036726,+-94.666295(38484)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38484) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
