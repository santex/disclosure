{"Tags":"City","divs":["sighting details driving to work one day during the morning, in sacramento, from watt ave entering highway 50-east. my exit was sunrise blvd in rancho cordova, about 15 minutes before i got off the freeway. then i began to notice a steel colored object i assumed to be a old world war 2 bomber that are a common sight when the air shows from the nearby military base occur. the distant object went from the left side of the freeway, gradually to the right over a 5 minute period. driving down a semi empty patch of freeway the object came closer, the bright morning sun on the steel glowed off the top making it hard to see. after the object moved to the right side of the freeway, a jet came from behind my car, it was impossible to miss from the square intakes to the wings that stood out distinctively that could fold back. the cockpit of the jet faced left in a hard turn as it crossed the middle of the freeway, the jet rotated it's orientation facing to the right dragging it's own weight to counter act the first turn. in half the turn towards the object as it came close began to change from even flight and started to react as the top of the craft bent in the direction of the jet. after the jet \"buzzed\" the object closest, it veered in the opposite direction left, revealing the underside to have a receded dark ring and a center that was not sunk inward. the climax that followed after i was shocked from the first pass followed as the jet made another pass in the same direction, the difference was the object was off to the right more. as the f-14 approached the object, it was swaying side to side as a response to the object's movement, left to right four or five times. at the last moment something happened, the craft began to disappear from bottom to top, time stood still to me as a witness. -i would describe this as transparency, as the craft began to disappear from bottom to top as the darkest regions went first to the upper top right as the brightest as all was seen last as a brilliant refection off a steel hull from the sun that was reduced to a speck in moments. -craft was larger than the perusing jet by about 1\\3 or more. after the object disappeared, the jet veered off to the right of the freeway, i assumed it went to the air force base near by in ranch cordova again. could not see any windows in the craft due to the sun's reflection, had a shiny steel look to most of the craft except one circular part underneath it. i leave 3 pictures of best i can describe the scene from art to the best 3d i can produce. please feel free to contact me in the evenings after 5pm i should be there, i always pick up on the message machine. call me any time!"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.597262,+-121.299978(14659)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14659) map </A>","Object Features":"Dome","City":"Rancho Cordova","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Rancho Cordova","There were no other sightings in Rancho Cordova on or around March 15th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"38.597262","Date Submitted":"03/15/2008 07:07 UTC","Longitude":"-121.299978","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01012009-0005","Sighting Duration":"00:09:00","Disposition":"Hoax","Object Shape":"Disc","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14659.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14659_submitter_file1__ufo3sides.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14659_submitter_file2__f-14toufoscaleb.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14659_submitter_file3__highwaysightsmar2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14659.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14659","Summary":"Depiction F-14 chases ufo after 5 minutes of watching, ufo goes transparent during second jet pass","Date of the Event":"03/15/2008 07:07 UTC"}
