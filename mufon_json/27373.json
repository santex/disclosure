As it got closer I could make out a total of three solid white lights in the shape of a triangle with the one red light blinking in the middle. It appeared to be about the size of my thumb in the sky and was completely silent. It was about the height of where a helicoper would fly, It was far too low to be an air plane and it was the shape of a triangle. As it turned to the right toward the north east the white lights turned off and all that remained was the blinking red light as it moved through the sky and out of eye sight. The sky was clear and the stars were out. All I could think of is I can't believe I'm seeing this with my wife."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27373.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27373.html"],"Latitude":"28.294206","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-81.406071","Date of the Event":"01/12/2011 08:20 UTC"}
