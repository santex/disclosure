{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out back trying to focus on the moon with my telescope my wife bought me for Father's Day when out of the corner of my eye I spotted a bright white star like orb almost like a fast float speed what was odd is that it was silent and had no beam like head lights or flashing lights like a plane. I turned on my phone to shoot the short clip but my storage only allowed what you see in it. So I ran to get my wife and by the time she came out it was gone. For this would be impossible at the speed it was moving it still should have been there. I will be forever haunted that I went to get my wife ---- chad in grove city Ohio"],"Country":"United States","Region":"Ohio","Date Submitted":"06/21/2013 12:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06212013-0001","Date of the Event":"06/20/2013 10:15 UTC","Summary":"I saw white slow moving orb come out of tree line bigger and brighter than stars have a short video went in to get wife and it was gone","City":"Grove City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.099154","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48291.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48291.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.883423,+-83.099154(48291)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48291) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"48291","Latitude":"39.883423","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Grove City","There were no other sightings in Grove City on or around June 20th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
