Next saw two round blurry but more sphere in shape fly by closer to window under wing of airplane it really got my attention, then one silver sphere with a red window flew right under the wing i saw it as clear as day i tracked it with my eyes and i know what i saw but could not think what it could have been so as i was leaving the plan just so know i wasent dreaming or something a asked the airline stuart what were those rounded sphere like objects maybe she would give me an answere because i know this would bug me for a long time not knowing what is was..
