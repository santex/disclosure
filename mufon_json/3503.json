The lead light was about twice as bright as the two following and the back end of the triangle was narrower than the sides. The lights were all white and non blinking. We weren't able to tell if it was a solid object or three objects in formation because it didn't pass in front of any of the visible stars. It moved very slowly to the south east then faded from view."],"Log Number":"US-06262005-0010","Case Number":"3503","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Brownsville","There were no other sightings in Brownsville on or around June 23rd 2005"],"Summary":"Triangular formation of 3 lights moving very slowly.","Date of the Event":"06/23/2005 11:02 UTC","Longitude":"-79.874116","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.027875,+-79.874116(3503)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3503) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/23/2005 11:02 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3503.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3503.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Brownsville"}
