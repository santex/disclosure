I have read of others seeing this same object, and I'm submitting my report to help anyone investigating to perhaps establish a time line. I was star gazing during the evening of 8-5-13. At 10:40 pm., I witnessed a large, very bright white star like object appear in the west over Erie, Pa. It was moving directly at me at a steady, fairly fast speed. I yelled for my wife, and she grabbed her digital camera, and ran out of the house to join me. By the time she reached me in our driveway, the object was directly overhead. The object continued to move eastward, and we watched it until it disappeared from our sight. My wife clicked multiple pictures, but nothing appeared in her Olympus digital camera. Maybe this camera is not good for this type of images. This is my second report within the past two weeks for events in Erie Pa. We have seen other objects this year around Erie, but I was not aware of this reporting sight."],"Latitude":"42.142493","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Erie","There was one other sighting in Erie on or around August 5th 2013"],"Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-08072013-0008","Region":"Pennsylvania","Longitude":"-80.016948","Summary":"Very bright, star like, but very huge compared to the brightest stars.","Date of the Event":"08/05/2013 10:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Erie","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49567.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49567.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/07/2013 11:16 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
