I seen something in the sky to my left so i started to watch it. It was phasing from red to yellow and had no sound what so ever. I realized it wasn't a plane or a helicopter so i ran inside and grabbed my camera. My girlfriends son was on the computer so i told him to come check it out. He came i started filming then he said there is another one. i told him to get his mom. she came out and seen it too. They were moving from east to west just below the edge of the storm clouds casting a little light on the clouds. They seemed kind of egg shaped not round. sorry i didn't upload the video but not sure how to yet. I was just blown away by what i seen because i usually can put some kind of explanation to things but this i am drawing a blank."],"Case Number":"36972","Log Number":"US-03282012-0021","City":"Mt Pleasant","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.601646,+-84.792782(36972)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36972) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
