I took my dog \"Brody\" outside with me when we got about halfway down to the lake his hair stood up on his back and something moved by the water. I stopped and my dog turned in front of me and ran back to the house I tripped when he bolted around me and as I looked back I swear I saw a skinny person run on the lake to the dock 3 houses down. I went back into the house but couldn't sleep that night so I took my dog in the car and drove around the neighborhood until I felt comfortable. 3 weeks later \"Yesturday\" I saw something again this time I took a flash light and saw something that didn't have a face and this time it ran across the entire lake. unfortunately my dog is the only other witness and I don't want to tell anyone else. any ideas????????"],"City":"Auburndale","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Something ran across my lake.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.780101","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16246.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16246.html"]}
