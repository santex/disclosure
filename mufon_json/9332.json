I thought at first it was the sunlight just playing tricks on me but then the fighter jets showed up. There were two of them slowly approaching the thing. Then i realized it wasn't just the light. The thing was shiny and looked like some type of metal shining in the sunlight. The thing was suddenly gone and the fighters zoomed after it. My friends and i have been seeing these things and it is starting to freak us out. Please reply, Owen."],"Summary":"round thing in sky not airplane going really fast by mount hood.","Date Submitted":"01/25/2008 07:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-01282008-0022","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.671007","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
