They did not move at all. This is the 2nd time we have seen them. The first time was November 3rd (3 lights that time). This time we only saw 2 lights. They were very bright when they were on, though they would fade out, much like a light would on a dimmer switch. They came on and off over a 3 hours period of time. At one point quite a few planes were in the sky flying towards it. It got brighter and brigher and then faded out. It would stay out for 20-45 minutes at a time, and reappear for 5-30 minutes at a time. It was in exactly the same place it was in on November 3rd. There had been strange clouds in the sky March 29th over the water. When I saw the strange clouds I wondered if I was going to see the lights again... and sure enough I did."],"Date of the Event":"03/29/2012 08:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around March 29th 2012"],"Latitude":"43.776629","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/30/2012 03:57 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Orange orbs hover over Lake Ontario"}
