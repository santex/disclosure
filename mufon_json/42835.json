{"divs":["sighting detailsi was driving home and out of my window i saw two bright lights (similar to the current brightness of venus that you can see in the sky right now). they were set wide, much wider than any aircraft i have seen. i do not think they were two separate craft as they moved in an extremely linear and stable fashion. before it had passed overhead, i had pulled into a neighborhood so i could slow down and get a better look. although there were, what i would assume to be, typical white forward lights, there were no \"right of way\" or strobe lights that typical planes would have. in addition, when i looked directly up at it while it passed, i could not make out a structure ��� in fact, between the lights, there seemed to be some sort of smoke or haze. moments after it passed i could see something like arcing electricity pass between the two lights and the port or left side of the craft seemed to disappear only leaving the one light on the right. the sound is what struck me even further. i was nearly beneath it and there was not the high pitch frequency that one would typically hear, it sounded more like a gentle wind (similar to the sound you make as you sound out the letter \"f\"). it looked like it was beginning descent and was headed roughly due north\\north west. this is the first time i have ever felt compelled to report in detail anything odd that i have seen, at least in recent years. i'm not saying that what i saw was alien, in fact, it did not seem alien at all. however, it was something that seemed very different and much more advanced by some measure than any commercial or military craft that i have ever seen."],"Case Number":"42835","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.134441,+-76.563386(42835)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42835) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/26/2012 04:33 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash, Other, Unknown","Log Number":"US-09262012-0014","Date of the Event":"04/25/2012 09:38 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Longitude":"-76.563386","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Elizabethtown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42835.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42835.html"],"Latitude":"40.134441","Summary":"Witnessed large, silent unidentified craft fly overhead without definitive structure","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Elizabethtown","There were no other sightings in Elizabethtown on or around April 25th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
