No sound at all. While the second one was in view saw a helicopter a distance away but not trying to follow the fire looking object. I could hear the helicopter. It was around 9:30 at night and sky was clear. We had several planes fly over later and you could hear their engines but no sound from the fire looking objects. My friend also witnessed this event. Neither of us had ever seen anything like this and I had lived close to Wright Pat for years. I could not tell how high they were except they were not as high as the planes that came over later."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47515.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.097524,+-82.672057(47515)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47515) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05192013-0016","Summary":"3 fire looking objects in sky...very bright..no sound","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Palm Harbor","There were no other sightings in Palm Harbor on or around May 18th 2013"],"Object Features":"None"}
