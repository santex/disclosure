At about 8:15 PM, as we drove over a hill, we saw a pale, grayish white glowing object hovering about 40 degrees over the horizon. It was of a saucer shape, with a small dome on top. It was of an unusual brightness compared to the dark evening sky and clouds, and could have been covered up by the held up thumb. However, it's apparent distance showed it could have been hundreds of feet wide. It seemed to be about a mile away, above Newton. It appeared stationary, but the movement of the car caused confusion as to weather it actually changed position, as apposed to a changing point of view. As our car drove down the hill, our new point of view brought the object about five degrees above the horizon. Passing trees and other obstructions brought the object in and out of view, making it difficult to observe flight paths, rotations, etc. (if any)! We saw the object several times this way for about ten minutes, and then had no more opportunities to see it. We wondered if it was a blimp, but the small dome on top makes this rather unlikely in my opinion. We took a detour into Belmont, hoping to see it again from one of the many hills there, but had no more sightings. It is unknown if the object flew off, or if we simply did not see it because it was blocked from view after that. After Belmont, we gave up and drove home, writing this report immediately after arrival. During the sighting, it was confirmed that the moon was no where near the object, making it impossible for this to be a bizarre view of the moon. It is unknown whether there were planes in the area, but this was clearly no plane. My mother saw the object a few times, but wanted to focused on driving. I, riding in the front-passenger seat, saw the object several times. (I do not know the exact number of times). I have been long fascinated by UFO's, so I was naturally excited, but I also felt slightly nervous and confused as to weather this was \"the real thing.\" My mother was not especially affected by the sighting. I cannot guarantee that the info in this report is exact, but it is as close as I can recall."],"City":"Newton","Summary":"Driving down highway saw pale white glowing saucer object.
