(cameras are sensitive to infrared light. try looking through your phone camera at a tv remote while you push buttons, you'll see light.) the video ends before any movement of the craft takes place. i went online to find out if anyone else had seen the same thing ad was very surprised to learn that people had been seeing the exact same lights with the exact same behavior for the past two nights (1\\14 and 1\\15) in addition to the same night i saw my lights. people have seen them as far north as central phoenix and as far south as maricopa, but everyone sees them to southwest. this implies that the lights are incredibly high up and absolutely massive. there are about 7 unique reports on ufostalker, some of which have comments by up to 15 people. in addition, both my coworker on the i-10 and myself saw cars parked and their drivers staring southwest at the lights. i stopped and asked a family of three who were staring at the sky if they were watching the lights. they said they were and, while we were talking, a third car pulled into the parking lot to have a look. this is not just a small sighting. i hoped that the lights might come back tonight, so i pulled two real cameras onto my roof and watched for about an hour. i saw nothing tonight (1\\17)."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Mass UFO (Phoenix Lights - type) Sighting (>50 people) in Central Arizona","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-111.631799","Date Submitted":"01/18/2013 01:13 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","City":"Queen Creek","Date of the Event":"01/16/2013 07:00 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Latitude":"33.249824"}
