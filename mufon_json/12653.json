(they looked like they were dancing with eachother, if that makes any sense) this time they did not disappear after a few seconds, but remained in the sky for several minutes. they looked exactly like what i had seen before- i'll say white, but that isn't exactly what i mean. they looked like the moon does when viewed in the daytime. appearing out of \"nowhere\" was then a larger orb, colored the same, but this one had two trails (like what follows an airplane) arc shaped and pointing toward eachother at one end. this one reminded me of a comet, but did not fall, rather danced like the others, only towards my left- which would be south. since i was driving in busy traffic, i could not get a picture with my cell phone until i was at a stoplight. my feelings at this time were confusion, excitement, amazement and joy once i realized they were going to be visible for a while. once at the stoplight i fumbled with my phone, growing increasingly frustrated that the three ahead were getting smaller and smaller, and the one traveling south was going to leave my field of vision soon. once i found the picture function, i held the phone up to take a picture and to my amazement the orbs were not visible in the veiwfinder! i could see them out my windsheild, but not in the picture view! i took two pictures anyway, hoping they would show up after the photos were enlarged. suddenly, i hear honking all around me and i felt an overwhelming sense of oneness with the people in neighboring cars because i think they see the same thing i am seeing, and are honking because of the ufos. after maybe 5 seconds of this, i realize they are honking at me, because i am holding up traffic- the light had turned green! to my disappointment and as far as i can tell, nobody else had seen anything! i decided to try to follow the ufos, and passed my turn to continue down rt 20. at this time the comet like ufo has gone off to the south and was no longer visible. the three in front were still getting smaller, and started to turn to the right (north) i called my husband to tell him what was happening, and then decided to pull over because i was driving dangerously- swearving and such trying to use the phone, watch the sky and ignoring the road for seconds at a time. i don't know where exactly i pulled off at- i think i was still in portage, but it was about one minute west of the rt 20 and willowcreek rd intersection- in the parking lot of a small motel. i apologize for the obscurity of what i am now going to relate. i can't understand why my memory about the most interesting part of this experience is so fuzzy, but it really is and i wish i could give more information. by this time all the orbs are out of sight, and i have my car in park and am relating what had happened to my husband, on the phone. (i'm getting frustrated, even now, trying to remember exactly what happened!) while talking, i see reddish violet light seeming to be all around me. my husband said he thought i got hit by a car because i started crying and saying oh my god oh my god, and hung up the phone- (i do not remember this, due to my panic, i guess) i don't recall getting out of the car, but i remember standing outside of my car and looking up and seeing many lights, directly above me, red and purplish red. this sounds crazy (sorry!) but i don't remember how long the lights were there, but it must of been only less than half a minute because by the time my husband called back (he said he called right back) it was gone- my fuzzy recollection seems to remember it (the lights) left, traveling straight up until they were no longer visible. nobody else seemed to see this! (no cars swearved or stopped) i am attaching the two images i took with the phone... though the ufos are not visible, and it seems to be only shots of an uneventful indiana sky. the images are in their original form, maybe if you had technology to enhance the image somehow something would become visible? one note on the images: you will see a grey wisp in both, which is center in the first photo, then more to the left in the second. maybe this is how the comet like orb (which was traveling to my left) was captured? i do not know how i could see something with my eyes, look at the view in the phone and it disappear, then look back up to see it again! i wish i had more hard evidence. all i can give is my word of honor that everything i have accounted is the absolute truth, and my inner self has been changed in a way impossible to relate in words. i feel blessed to of seen this, and i had no fear of the crafts. thank you for listening."],"Date Submitted":"09/16/2008 04:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.581051","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.581051,+-87.172186(12653)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12653) map </A>","City":"Portage","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.172186","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09192008-0019","Date of the Event":"09/16/2008 04:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12653.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12653_submitter_file1__20andWillowcreek.jpeg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12653_submitter_file2__20andWillowcreek2.jpeg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12653.html"],"Case Number":"12653"}
