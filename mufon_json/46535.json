THEY SEEMED TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK WITH ME , AS I DROVE MY TRUCK NORTH ON HIGHWAY 87. THEY WOULD APPEAR AND THEN HIDE BEHIND THE MOUNTAIN TOPS , UP AND DOWN AND THEN MOVE SO FAST IN A NORTH BOUND WAY . FROM THE ROAD , THEY LOOKED ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASEBALL, BUT THEY WERE FIVE MILES AWAY, SO I KNOW THEY HAD TO BE AT LEAST THE SIZE OF A HOUSE . I SAW THESE MANY TIMES AS I DROVE THE ROADS NORTH ON MY RUN FOR SAFEWAY STORES. I AND A FRIEND WERE SITTING BY A FIRE AT HORESHOE LAKE ON THE APACHE RESERVATION IN AZ. WE SQAT THERE JUST VISITING , MY WIFE HIT THE SACK , AND MARY AND I SAT OUT SIDE , IT WAS A GOOD FIRE AND NICE TIME TALKING, AS I TALKED AND I WAS STARING AT THE WATERS EDGE , WE WERE ONLY FIVE FEET AWAY FROM THE EDGE OF THE LAKE . I LOOKED OVER AT MARY , AND SHE WAS STARING UP TO MY LEFT AT THE DAM . HER MOUTH WAS OPEN AND SHE WAS JUST STARIMNG UP , SO I LOOKED UP AT WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT , THERE OVER THE LAKE AND THE DAM AT ABOUT MAYBE 7 OR 8 HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE LAKE AND ABOUT A HALF MILE TO MY LEFT WAS THIS SHIP ! IT WAS AT LEAST ONE MILE LONG OR WIDE . IT HAD ABOUT SEVEN LIGHTS AROUND IT'S EDGE . IT WAS DARK , BUT WE COULD SEE THE OUT LINE OF THAT SHIP ,THE NIGHT WAS MOON LITE AND THIS SHIP COVERD UP MUCH OF THE MOON . IT WAS LARGE , NO NOISEOR AND SOUND OF ANY KIND , JUST A PEACEFUL FEELING I FELT AS I WAS WATCHING THIS SHIP , WE BOTH DON'T KNOW HOW LING WE WATCHED THIS SHIP , BUT WE BOTH FELT A PEACEFUL FEELING . ALMOST AS IF THEY SAID NOT TO WORRY , THEY WON'T HURT US , THEY DIDN'T SPEAK , THIS IS WHAT I FELT THEY SAID IN MY MIND . I KNOW THIS WE WILL AGAIN BE VISITED, I DON'T KNOW HOW I KNOW THIS , BUT IT STANDS IN MY MIND ALWAYS . I HAVE SEEN SO MUCH , NOW I JUST WANTED TO TELL SOME ONE , I STILL TALK TO MARY, AND SHE DON'T WANT TO Talk about it . but like I said , I know they are here with us every day , and have been here ever since time began , this is something that puzzels me , how do I know this , I see it in my dreams at night many times . if you want to talk to me about this , I will talk , thank you"],"trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Parker","There were no other sightings in Parker on or around August 12th 1997"],"Case Number":"46535","Date of the Event":"08/12/1997 08:10 UTC","Region":"Arizona","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46535.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46535.html"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Tags":"City","City":"Parker","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Window(s)"}
