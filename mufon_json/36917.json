She was sitting in the back seat of our suburban with my wife���s I-phone. She took several pictures. On 3-25-12 my wife decided to go thought some photos and delete some to free up space. The first few pictures showed nothing, this one showed something??? Then a few more photos of nothing. No one saw this until the photo was reviewed?? What do you think?
