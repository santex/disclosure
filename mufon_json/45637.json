It had was silent. It had two wings the first set where shorter and the set behind the 1st set where longer. It flew about 56 feet above the trees and a grey fume came out of the end. It had 4 windows my brother and I thought it was a military experimental plane but in a small city with no military base it was impossible. I turned to my brother we both just gaped our mouths open then we looked back at the plane. It had no wheels it slowly made its way towards the rock river it was slightly tilted toward my brother and I. It started to go over the trees near the river then silently it just disappeared.
