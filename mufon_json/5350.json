I decided not to try to run for the camera as I could not return in time. A little scared I looked in the windows to see if something was looking at me. There was not. I have not really thought about it since,though it is as clear as yesterday. I watched a UFO Tv show and decided to share my account. I remember that planes in 1962 all made noise, and were not black! At the time I thought it might be a gov. spy craft from Fort Riley near Juction City Ks. The craft was incredibly close, looked like a cigar box shape but all smoothly rounded no sharp corners anywhere and approx.12-15ft high (top to bottom of craft).
