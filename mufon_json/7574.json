Then we saw something from above the trees. We didnt know what it was until we realized it was spinning in the air as a disc-shaped flying machine with alot of blinking lights of all colors. The technology around us went crazy. The lights flickered and the internet went out. We were frightened, and a little suprised.After we noticed it we ran inside to notify our parents. We lost sight of the flying object when it passed the trees on the other side of the house. Nothing I know can go as fast as this thing did. We have NO pictures but we believe in what we saw. Please just tell us if this thing could really be a UFO or just an everyday airplane flown at night."],"Case Number":"7574"}
