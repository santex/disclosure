The yellow lights below in the pic are beach lights and the white dot on top of the pic is the UFO . There are many UFO's here in cochin . U can mistake them for stars except they move . I have been seeing these UFO's for months now . I think they are scouting for abducting me and the Indian govt already knows about it as there are planes all around . Helicopters and fixed wing strike air craft . The UFO's dont make any noise . They are not afraid of the govt planes . If you get in touch with me then i can show them to you . Later you can get a alienology expert team here to cochin and catch the greatest UFO scoop of the mellianium . Namely a stand off between them( aliens) and the govt ."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"India","Region":"Kerala","Latitude":"9.931233"}
