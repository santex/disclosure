I looked up about 1000 yards beyond the restaurant to see 4 lights flying and flashing irregularly. I asked my fellow witnesses what it was, thinking I had missed something, but nobody had an answer. I proceeded to film the ufos while a plane passed overhead. The plane does not show up on video. The lights continued to fly after I stopped filming for at least another 5 minutes before disappearing suddenly. I immediately assumed these were extraterrestrial crafts because of their flight pattern and their bright flashing lights. I was bewildered by these lights, as were 3 of my companions (there were children aboard too who saw it). There were flashes of light that could have been lightning coming from the west. However, there were hardly any clouds. I lost sight of the original lights while scanning the sky for whatever was causing the flashes to the east."]}
