{"Latitude":"38.247851","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/07/2011 08:45 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI have game camera's set out to watch wildlife and on October 7th 2011 at 8:45 PM a object with multiple lights was spotted on 1 of the camera's.. The video is 30 seconds long.. I have viewed this video multiple times and have counted up to 8 lights on it , it appears to spin at times.. As a hunter who has spent countless hours in the fields and timber , I have NEVER witnessed anything like this , in person or on my game camera's.. The object seemed to \"float\" down from above the camera , came close to landing , then banked to the left and appeared to gain altitude , later in the video it appeared again and started rising , gaining altitude.. There is a deer in the video that seemed bewildered but yet interested in the object.. I am an average person with NO experience with UFO's.. Video needs to be brightened to view the full effect of the sighting.."],"Log Number":"US-10302011-0017","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Warsaw","There were no other sightings in Warsaw on or around October 7th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-93.374401","City":"Warsaw","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32966.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32966.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"10/30/2011 03:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Missouri","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Summary":"unidentified object with lights caught on game camera","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.247851,+-93.374401(32966)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32966) map </A>","Case Number":"32966","Tags":"City"}
