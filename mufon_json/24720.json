I have spent the last 10 years or so watching air planes go by - it gets kinda boring just looking up at the sky. I was laying in the pool in the afternoon on Tuesday and I heard a jet - from past experience I know that I can only hear them when they have gone directly over my house and are moving away. I looked for it and found it to be very different from anything that I have ever seen. It was cigar shaped and flying with the wide side moving forward - it also seemed to be moving much faster than 99% of the planes I have seen. It was tan in color and also had two red stripes about 10 to 20% from each end. I'm wondering if it was just a really short jet and the light made me only see the wings. I've seen a lot of TV programs about the cigar shaped aircraft, but not about what direction they fly."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24720.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24720_submitter_file1__Cigar.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24720.html"],"Case Number":"24720","Date Submitted":"07/23/2010 02:47 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07232010-0004","Source":"MUFON","City":"Lamberton","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
