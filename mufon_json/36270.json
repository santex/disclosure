i drove just a little ways down the road, and i realized: how stupid! i said \"we are just getting further away! why didnt i drive into the neighborhood!?\" my girlfriend said \"i dont know\". i said \"why didnt you tell me to drive into the neighborhood?\" she said \"i dont know, i was just going with what you were doing\". \"should i turn back?\" we looked back and could see no strange lights. we continued on. i really feel that we were \"diverted\". im not necessarily taking it to the extreme of \"mind-control\", but i think i was remotely influenced to pass on by the sight. the drive was a strange mix of silence and excited talking. to my suprise, my girlfriend brought up that at first, she thought she was witnessing the crash of an aircraft- exactly what i had felt internally! we brainstormed on things it couldve been. we asked eachother repeatedly \"did we just see a ufo?\". that night i had a strange dream about \"grey\" aliens. i dont want to recount it here. but i will say, that i dont believe it was a \"memory\" of an abduction or something, as the setting was somewhere far away (and from my childhood), and it was daylight in the dream. also, my entire family was in the dream. the next morning when i woke up, i felt emotionally shell-shocked. i thought of the lights and the object, and my eyes watered, like i was about to cry. i said to my girlfriend: \"was that real?\" anyway, that's about it. i have more details and theories, but im with-holding them for some semblance of brevity. if you have questions or helpful comments, i hope there is a way for mufon to put you in touch with me through email."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"09/01/2011 01:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.222486,+-80.806813(36270)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36270) map </A>"}
