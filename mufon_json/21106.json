Straight out the windshield, my friend and I noticed a strobe light at about 25 degrees in the sky. It was similar to an Airplane's anti-collision strobe but more intense, plus it just flashed just off and on, unlike a patterned sequence. It was traveling slowly left to right in the sky, then made an abrupt stop and started to reverse course. About 10 seconds after the direction change back to the left and staying level, the light just went out and did not return. We were traveling on a straight section of highway, so the cars movement did not cause the object to change position in the sky. I know there's an airport and a military base in the area and I always look to the sky when I am outside and I have never seen an odd thing like this before."],"City":"Atlantic City","Case Number":"21106","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21106.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21106.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.372613,+-74.420367(21106)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21106) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Atlantic City","There were no other sightings in Atlantic City on or around December 23rd 2009"]}
