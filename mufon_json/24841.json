{"Latitude":"40.100351","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsScottdale, Pennsylvania. My son and I stepped out our back door onto a deck. Time was 10:59 p.m. I looked up into the northeast sky and saw what appeared to be a huge, green fireball moving in a downward direction. I yelled for my son to look up - which he did - and we both watched it as it disappeared from our vantage point below a neighbor's roof line. I probably saw the object for no more than 3 seconds; and my son saw it for probably just 2 seconds. His description is the same as mine - about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. But he says there was fire coming from behind it. I quickly did a time check. I remained outside for an additional 30 minutes, but did not see it or anything like it again."],"Summary":"Huge green fireball moved in a downward motion over Scottdale.","Longitude":"-79.586983","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24841.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24841.html"],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07292010-0023","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.100351,+-79.586983(24841)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24841) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Scottdale","There were no other sightings in Scottdale on or around July 29th 2010"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"24841","Date Submitted":"07/29/2010 11:40 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/29/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Scottdale"}
