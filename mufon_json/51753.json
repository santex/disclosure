It was still dark with clods moving in. The moon was still up and almost full. Iwas filling a water tank and looked up at the moon. Inoticed the strs were moving. I watched large triangle shaped objects escorted by 4 to 5 small objects move slowly and quietly from the sw to the nw for about q A half-hour. They either were done at first light or I couldn't see them. I don't know if they were a squadron of conventional aircraft or not. The lack of speed and noise makes me doubt it. The local airbase is east and parallel to the flight path of these objects."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"South Dakota","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Blackhawk","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Blackhawk","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"51753","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51753.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51753.html"]}
