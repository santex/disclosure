One of these things made a u-e and turned right at us. As I watched it came over the over bridge on exit 30. It was almost as long as the bridge. We were about 2 miles from bridge at this time. A trucker pulled in front of us and stayed with us till we got off at exit 36. One of these things followed us to my sisters house. Later that night I thought I saw someone outside my bedroom door. They was big,shoulders was at top of door, blond, blue eyed. dressed roman like. One may have nothing to do with the other but I don't see a lot of giants that just go puff either. 18 years ago April i saw a ship up close but it looked nothing like this.
