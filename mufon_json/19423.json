The ring at the top of the cone had a defined thickness of ultra pure light. The ring at the top quickly blended into the rest of the cone which stayed bright white , with defined edges. Within seconds the lighted cone which was very large in the sky,began to dim leaving it to look like it was diffusing into the blackness of the sky. The bright light was withdrawn into the cone itself leaving only a white veil which appeared to look as if it was of a smoke like character. When it was gone there was only darkness. No sound or movement was felt or seen during the twenty or so seconds which this display took place."],"Summary":"Light from sky, disappeared into cloud of light that slowly faded away.","City":"Arlington","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19423.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19423.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.418334,+-71.152843(19423)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19423) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO"}
