We observed an object about 1000 to 1500 ft above. What we saw could easily have been overlooked at first as it was emitting no light or sound. The object which was about the size of a plane, at first seemed triangular in shape but subtly changed in shape (kind of like mercury) to a boomerang appearance and at times ovular it was a dull grey color with a hazy mist and seemed to at times have a faint glow. We watched as the object moved NNW. 2 to 2 minutes later we observed a second boomerang-like object much more elongated and thin than the first. This object could have at first glance passed as a flock of birds flying in V formation however it was solid, emitted a low glow and was heading smoothly NNW as well."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron, Oval","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-96.768343","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Dallas","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
