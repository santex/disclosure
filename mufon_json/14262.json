Only lights on was backdoor light. Dogs were running around yard as usual. What drew my attention to object I witnessed, was one of my cats, who would normally stays a distance from me, ran towards me and stopped right by my right leg. She sat down and was looking up over the roof of house. I looked at the cat, thinking she was probably just looking at plane lights or maybe a bird so something. She kept looking, so then I looked up to see what she was seeing. What I believed I saw at first, was a mass of bird flying over, and more than likely geese, since the formation was sort of looked liked a shape of geese migrating. But then reality hit me. It was moving at approximately 10 to 20 mph, almost parallel to my street, but when I focused on it, I then could see, that it had mass, and structure of a wedge shape. It was close enough that I could get a base size from comparing it to the roof of my home. The overall length was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and height was approximately 7 to 10 feet, and it was only 100 to 200 feet from the ground. I was looking at the right lower quarter, from bow to stern. There weren���t any lights or any sound what-so-ever emitting from the craft. The right side was visible because of the lights of homes and a few street lights carried the that height. I also had a small private aircraft flying at one to two thousand feet at about 2 miles southwest of our location, so I could get some variable and we have high pecan trees which also gave me some comparison to height from the ground. What was apparent, the side wasn���t a smooth surface. I say this because you could see dark and then somewhat lighter shades. This to me could have been either two assumptions: 1. The surface was painted, as we do some of our military aircraft, so it will blend in with the sky (clouds lighter and darker) or 2. the surface had angles on it which would show lighter for the parts protruding out and dark for the area that was indented. This is similar to our stealth aircraft for displacing radar. The light of homes and street lights were barely hitting the surface of the object but it was enough to make out the details."],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Mesquite","There were no other sightings in Mesquite on or around December 5th 2008"]}
