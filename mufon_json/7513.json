are in the approach area to large airports oakland international, sfo. we have seen these or similar on several occasions, some corroborated by friends across town, so always try to scan when out. at approximately 6:35pm i noticed a white spherical object due south at 45-50 deg. distance and altitude hard to determine. i then saw a second, then a third smaller by 50-75% but both at about 20 deg. of arc from the original object. one at 11 o'clock the other at 5 o'clock. i could detect no movement but an imperceptible drift north as time passed. i observed them by eyes only with correct distance glasses while my wife went for my watch, camera and video cam. at one point i thought i saw one of the smaller secondary objects split, but could not be sure. i started shooting with my digital slr (pentax *istd) with a standard macro zoom f-lens 1:4 \\70~200mm. i took 45 images jpeg at 6 megapixel resolution and 3 in raw format that did not resolve well enough. i could not see structure through the lens. only a fairly indistinct sphere. my zoom was at max (200mm) most of the shots, but took several exposures at wider field including a set showing an aircraft, passenger airliner at high altitude in a sky lane usually for routes la to seattle. this one from south going north. taking those particular exposures at 1-2 seconds apart. at this point i called mufon nor cal director ruben uriarte who is a couple miles from me, but could not get him. i next called another mufon member (don) a friend about 4 miles west of me to see if he could see the object and we could triangulate, but he could not see them with naked eye or with his telescope. he did tell me he saw earlier a similar object that split, and was positive what he saw was not conventional objects. he stayed on the phone so we could continue to observe and discuss. after i felt i had good images, i changed to my hi8 sony digital handycam with steady shot and super night vision. i got approximately 6 minutes of video. i was not able to resolve detail in the low-res video cam viewfinder, although i could see some structure artifacts in the video on review. i continued to watch as several aircraft went overhead at what seemed a much lower altitude. don told me the clouds (fog from coast) covering view from his position. we where still clear skies from our own observing position, but prevailing winds would carry them this way. i continued to look but i saw that the object had traveled a good 40-50 degrees of arc and viewing angle was now at 50-55 degrees and would be obscured by the large liquid amber tree on the street in our line of sight. wind was about 5-10 mph at ground, but as the coastal fog clouds came in from the north moving south at what looked like 500ft at 10-20 mph and was crossing over the more distant object, again that was moving north at a very slow but deliberate rate. i was able to keep the object in the viewfinder as the clouds crossed over it, giving me a good indication that the object if a balloon was in a much higher altitude with calm winds moving north, against the lower level. possible but lower probability. when the object went into the tree i changed position, but could not see the object after that. i shot a few seconds in case i could resolve it in review but could not. i recorded then my position and viewing angle in video for the record. by then coastal fog clouds had covered us. i immediately reviewed the images (i am a digital graphics specialist) and found that the slr digital camera had resolved structure, but amorphous or changing shape. it could be construed as a bunch of balloons, but was not consistent therefore unlikely. the shape was somewhat like a center spire protruding vertically and top and bottom with spherical shapes around it, sometimes in a horizontal orbital configuration, but changing second to second. if a bunch of white balloons where being buffeted by wind that violently they would also be moving faster in the sky, and, with prevailing winds likely. don came right over and we ran some filtering to see any hidden details or other objects, but that was largely inconclusive. after reviewing video i found that details where less striking but did record cloud movement in relation to the object and at one point, saw the secondary object moving non-relative to the main object. i have available 39 good exposure stills in jpg and 6 minuets of video in 3 formats. 1 format was direct to dvd and the other two are direct to mpg from cam and dv video files. i will archive on a dvd data disc. video not ready for transfer as of this report date, but will be added later."],"Log Number":"US-07242007-0004","Summary":"Amorphous White Object and 2 companion objects","Object
