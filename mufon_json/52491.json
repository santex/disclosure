At first i thought it had to be the spot light off of a helicopter because it was very bright. the brightest object in the sky for 2 hrs. but i continued to watch it for like 15 mins and it didnt appear to be moving or have any flashing lights just a solid white light. it just stood there like a HUGE bright star. Every 15 mins after my smoke i would go outside to see if the object was still there. it appeared to have moved very slowly towards the west on a straight horizontal path. until about 2 hrs had passed and i no longer observed the object in the sky. i pointed the object out to several family members and 1 even got a still photo."],"Object Features":"None","Region":"Colorado","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11292013-0007","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52491.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52491.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"11/29/2013 01:56 UTC","trends":[],"Summary":"never saw anything like it before. very bright white light","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
