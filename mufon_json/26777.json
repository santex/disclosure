{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI'm a Colombian citizen living in the city of Kingston, Jamaica. I love sunsets here, and yesterday's sunset was particularly beautiful, so I went out to the yard of the apartment that I rent to take some pictures of it. I loved the colors of a cloud that was above me, so I took a picture of it. At that moment I did not see anything unusual, and, as far as I can remember, there were no stars on the sky yet. However, when I downloaded the pictures to my computer, I noticed a bright spot in the upper left side of the picture of the cloud. Like I said before, I didn't see anything at the moment when I took the picture, and I'm not sure if it is an star or a plane. I think you might find the picture interesting, and that's why I'm submitting this report to you. And of course, I would love to know what the object on the picture is. Thank you."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"UFO appeared on picture I took.
