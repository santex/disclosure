I rolled over in bed to feed her and saw the object out of the corner of my eye. I thought it was the planet Venus or a large star, but it was too close and too low to be a star. It moved form the top of the Foothills upward, then over my home , out to the Eastern plains. It was large and glowing like a star. There was no flashing, like airplane lights. I ran outside to watch it. There was no sound at all. I expected to hear something. I watched it until I could not see it anymore. The sun came up soon after. I am up all the time gazing out my window towards the west and I have never seen anything like this before. It seemed as close as a small airplane, but as large as a venus in the night sky. Its' brightness and speed were consistently the same over the two minute period."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.59022,+-105.080603(15854)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15854) map </A>"}
