{"Longitude":"-73.996103","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking home from Soho and saw a silver egg shaped object while I was traversing Bowery (street) , I pointed it out to my friend and it changed color and went behind a building, we stopped and waited for it to fly past the building and when it emerged it was a black boomerang shape approximately 1cm in length to the naked eye from where we were standing. Two elderly men also saw the UFO and we were staring at it for about 5 minutes, it just stayed in the sky at the same spot so it couldn't have been a weather balloon, then it slowly changed back into a cigar shape and then into a small egg shaped and was still for another 5 mins, we began walking back downtown and never took our eyes off it, but then it started getting smaller and smaller and then there was an airplane that flew past, but when the airplane got close the UFO just disappeared."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Egg, Oval","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around July 26th 2011"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.724243,+-73.996103(29737)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29737) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/26/2011 03:10 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/26/2011 03:41 UTC","City":"New York","Log Number":"US-06262011-0014","Latitude":"40.724243","Case Number":"29737","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29737.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29737.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"UFO Spotted over lower manhattan","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"New York"}
