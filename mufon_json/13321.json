{"City":"Alamogordo","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband & I stopped in White Sands, NM on a trip with my sister in May 1995. It was her first visit so she took several photos. We didn't see anything in the sky (or hear anything) when we took the photo & never noticed anything in the photo until I scanned it into the computer today to put on disc. If you zoom in on the photo, you can see another object down to the left above the clouds, but it isn't as surprising as the one I circled."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"13321","Log Number":"US-10282008-0037","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13321.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13321_submitter_file1__WhiteSandsUFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13321_submitter_file2__WhiteSandsUFO3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13321_submitter_file3__WhiteSandsUFOdetail.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13321.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/30/1995 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Alamogordo","There were no other sightings in Alamogordo on or around April 30th 1995","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.904632","Date of the Event":"04/30/1995 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-105.950805","Region":"New Mexico","Object Shape":"Chevron","Summary":"Not seen in sky at the time we took a photo, but shows in photo.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.904632,+-105.950805(13321)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13321) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
