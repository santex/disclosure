I didn't believe my eyes, so I slowed down almost to a stop and looked some more until I believed my eyes. The rim around the center was parallel to the ground like the thing had a top and bottom. Other than the rim around the center there were no other lines or markings on the sphere. It was beautiful. Whatever it was made of gave off light, the whole sphere. It seemed to be about where a small airplane would fly overhead, and it was completely still. Since it was the middle of the night and I was the only vehicle on the road, I decided that I needed to get out of there just in case. I went home.....no lost time or anything. Now I am very curious. Most people think I'm crazy or a liar so I havn't reported it until now."],"Object Features":"Other"}
