After several minutes, a couple of aircraft passed over and flew in the vicinity of the vehicle indicating the possible UFO was above tree level but not at high altitude. During the course of the hour, I attempted to make contact with the vehicle with a flashlight and contact was likely made. It appeared to respond with my \"signaling\" and once I stopped signaling. I put the flashlight down and began to sway to and fro and the UFO to mimic my movements and vice versa. This exchange lasted for about an hour and ceased once I broke off contact by going inside for the night."],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
