Sraight ahead of me in the sky I could see orange balls of light throught the trees across the street. They were moving northeast and upward. One of the light balls came above the tree line and then stopped. I told my friends and we they all got up to look. After about 3 min. it just disappeared. We resumed our conversation and about 10 min later, I noticed the same thing. This time going in the same direction, but we could see more. I realized sooner what was happening and told everyone that it was there again. We could see about 3-4 balls ascending behind the trees and this time two rose above the tree line and then stopped. Again they hovered about 3 min and then disappeared. Everyone was surpised and excited to have seen this. I even took a picture of it on my iPhone. You can see it if you look at it in a dark room"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Summary":"2 sightings, 10 min apart, almost same config of orange orbs traversing the sky and stopping then later disappearing","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40766.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40766.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.772179,+-88.026193(40766)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40766) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/13/2012 01:31 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07132012-0007","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-88.026193"}
