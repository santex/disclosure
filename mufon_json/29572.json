{"Latitude":"39.100896","Region":"Missouri","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving home on 152 eastbound in kansas city, mo. To my left was a very large v-shaped aircraft with a large red light at the tip and about 3 white lights going down each side of the craft. They were blinking, the craft was hovering in place and at times seemed to move very slowly forward. Once it seemed to move very smoothly in a sideways \"U\" pattern, then resumed hovering. I took 169 north and got back onto 152 east and the craft was still there. My boyfriend took the same route home 30 minutes later and stated the craft was still there at the same location when he was driving down the interstate. He was able to take a few pictures although they do not do justice to the craft's size or presence."],"trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were no other sightings in Kansas City on or around June 15th 2011"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Date Submitted":"06/15/2011 11:49 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Kansas City","Date of the Event":"06/15/2011 10:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-06152011-0017","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.100896,+-94.569977(29572)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29572) map </A>","Summary":"V-shaped aircraft with a red orb at the tip, and about 3 lights going down each side of the craft.
