Dad said \"What the hell is that\" I looked up naturally and there in the sky was a BRIGHT not MOVING AT ALL RED, VERY RED and ROUND GLOWING \"something\". It was from where we are located... in the N NW sky about 30-35 degrees from the ecliptic. It was stationary. It was so obvious and brilliant, if no one else saw this thing, I will be shocked. It got brighter... then dimmed a little, then got BRIGHTER, then seemed to back off a little, and kept doing this in the SAME SPOT in the sky for 2 mins, approx. based on cell phone time that I glanced at as we walked out the door, and then checked it again after it very very slowly... while still in the same spot faded, faded, and gone. I have never reported a UFO. I was so amazed by what we had seen, I had to make a report. It was nothing I have ever seen, and am so curious if anyone else saw it, which if they didn't, would just shock me. Thanks"]}
