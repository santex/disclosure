{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"03/31/2004 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","City":"Sacramento","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in passenger seat of my friends minivan. Traveling southbound on I-5 either April or May 2004 near Sacramento (cant remember if it was south of city or north)? It was approx 2am to 3 am on a clear nite. He was driving, we both were looking straight ahead when a triangular object white in color ,or maybe luminating but not glaring, swooped down from the sky right in front of vehicle heading right at windshield from the south when it swooped up over our heads and was gone.At arms length i would say the object was about 10 inches on all 3 sides so maybe approx 10 -12 feet long on all sides . It was smooth like one piece. No noise was heard. It was so close i would say 15 feet? The swoop took like 3 seconds.We did not notice object before or after buzzing. We kept going. We knew it wasnt good to have things buzzing your vehicle."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13649.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13649.html"],"Summary":"Small White Triangle","Date of the Event":"03/31/2004 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-121.48468","Log Number":"US-11102008-0024","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.585152,+-121.48468(13649)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13649) map </A>","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around March 31st 2004"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Latitude":"38.585152","Case Number":"13649"}
