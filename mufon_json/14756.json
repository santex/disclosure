It appeared large and so I assumed it was no more than a mile or two away. It seemed to go down in the vicinity of the Commonwealth Edison plant on the Des Plaines river in Romeoville. There was a low-flying plain flying toward it as it fell. There were fresh chemtrails in a generally east to west pattern at the time. Two planes made low passes over the area in the next few minutes."]}
