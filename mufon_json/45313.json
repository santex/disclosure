At 11:42am I was around the Cockeysville area when I noticed this object literally appear out of nowhere in the sky in front of me. At first I thought it might have been a plane that changed direction that made it more visible. But then seconds later this object tilted or did something to make it reflect the sun. When it did this, it was a shining circle in the sky. It stayed like this for about 2 seconds and then went back to its original position. A couple of seconds later it tilted again, reflected the sun for about another 2 seconds, then went back to its original position. The landscape then got in the way of my view of the object and I was not able to spot it again. I saw the object for about 8 to 10 seconds before I lost sight of it."]}
