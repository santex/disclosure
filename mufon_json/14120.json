{"Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my girlfriends garden when I looked up in the sky.It was a clear night and i could see planes very clearly in the sky.Where my girlfriends garden is,there is a nature reserve at the back of her garden so there are no street lights and no light pollution.Anyway,I was looking up and seen a star like object moving.I then realised there was another star like object in front and that this object was connected.I was extemely shocked as the object must of been massive.It was very high in the sky and I knew it was massive because we see planes all the time in the sky and they are only tiny in comparrison,even when at a low altitude.I could not make out the exact shape of the object but the two lights, one at each end of the object gave me a rough idea that she object was very long and straight.I immediatly called my girlfriend and she run in the back garden along with her daughter.My girlfriend also saw the object for about 5 to 10 seconds before it dissapeared.My girlfriends daughter only saw the back light before it dissapeared.It was ammazing as we love to look at the stars at night and we see numerous objects in the sky from planes to satalites to meteors burning up.but nothing like this.This object must of been absolutely massive.I was amazed whilst my girlfriend was both exited and scared at the same time.The object looked like it was moving slowish, but that was hard to judge,because of the vehicles apparent size and also we did not know the exact altitude,althuogh because of planes in the sky,the object seemed to be at a very high alltitude,which would of meant it might be as big as a mile or more in length.The lights on the object just faded out as it moved further away, that is why my girlfriends daughter only saw the back light as the front light had already faded."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"England","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14120.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14120.html"],"Summary":"Massive object with lights at either end.","Date of the Event":"11/28/2008 05:30 UTC","Case Number":"14120","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.483181,+-2.246436(14120)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14120) map </A>","City":"Manchester","Log Number":"GB-11292008-0008","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"53.483181","Sighting Duration":"00:01:10","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Manchester","There were no other sightings in Manchester on or around November 28th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"11/28/2008 05:30 UTC","Country":"United Kingdom","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-2.246436"}
