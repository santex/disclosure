I mentioned that it was probably a medical helicopter as we are directly in the flight path of UW Med flight. I started to take notice as it got closer to us, the object emitted a bright white searchlight flash and then turned orange in color. It continued to do this as it got closer. I assumed it was a helicopter and it would turn toward the hospital but it continued its path directly over our house at an altitude of 1000 ft I estimate. As it neared our house, the lights started to fade and the object became dimmer. As it flew directly over, I looked straight up at it and saw a solid odject with a haze surrounding the edges. I could not make out any outline other then my daughter thought it was circular in shape. It was not a helicopter. No sound was emitted. As it flew over the object started to disappear until it faded away a few seconds after crossing over our home. Clear sky, 75 degrees, many planes flying typical commercial flight paths. Afterward, we just tried to figure out what we saw."],"Summary":"We observed an object that traveled in a straight line west to east directly over our house.","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Fireball, Flash, Oval, Sphere, Star-like, Triangle","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/21/2012 10:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-07222012-0002","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Wisconsin","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-89.417642","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"43.010855","City":"Fitchburg"}
