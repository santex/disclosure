We were looking at the moon and a jet that was coming in on flight path to a local airport. Way above the commercial jet was a triangular shaped object that was heading in a straight line from West to East with a short contrail behind it probably 5 times the length of the object. I think it was a military plane but it was way to high and going way too fast than normal. My reaction was this is really odd because I have not seen commercial or military planes that high before.. Maybe an SR-71 but those are retired. It looked like the shape of the Space Shuttle but I know that is not up there. It has yet to launch. I tried to take a picture with my cell phone camera but the object was too far up to get into the picture. The object continued East. No lights that I could see but it reflected white in front of the contrail. It was close to sunset so the sun rays were reflecting off the bottom of the object. It just continued East and eventually went out of sight into the distance. I would like to know if the FAA would have tracked the object and would be able to tell me what it was."],"Date Submitted":"07/08/2011 12:05 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-88.060732","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30055.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30055.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Glen Ellyn","There were no other sightings in Glen Ellyn on or around July 7th 2011"],"Summary":"I believe it was military plane.
