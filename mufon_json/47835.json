We observed what we had at first thought was an airplane. I considered that slightly odd at first as it wasn't that high in sky and i know the local airport likes to shut down before 11pm. Thus object at first appeared to be coming or way but then changed directions. The next ones seemed to start one at a time but at one time three of them formed a triangle of sorts. They seemed to disappear about a minute after entering our vision. There were more than 10 of these objects but less than 20. we have no idea what these things were just thought it was strange."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47835.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47835.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.078522,+-89.39775(47835)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47835) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.078522","Longitude":"-89.39775","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Madison","There were no other sightings in Madison on or around June 3rd 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"47835","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/03/2013 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown"}
