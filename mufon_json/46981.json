Obeject was travelling north west at a very high rate of speed. All that could be seen was two rectangular more square than rectangular emitting and bright orange light. There was a space between the two rectangles. The rectangles were side by side. The objest was travelling at a very high rate of speed not lowering or lifting in the sky. It was out of sight in about 5 seconds. It made no sound what so ever. The only way I could describe the speed is to liken it to a jet fighter doing a fly by at a very high rate of speed very low to the ground. Except this object was probably about 5000 feet in the air or more. It had no other lights of any kind. Just to the west was a plan about same altitude heading in in a south east direction. strobes on plane were visable. Plane did not make any course changes. The oblect flew so fast that no other description was noted"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46981.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46981.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Aurora","There were no other sightings in Aurora on or around April 22nd 2013"],"Region":"Ontario","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Aurora","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Log Number":"CA-04252013-0019","Case Number":"46981","Longitude":"-79.457408","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.99846","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05"}
