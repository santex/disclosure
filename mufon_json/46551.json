She would finaly convince me no one was there or the dogs would have been barking? After several weeks of this happening we talked about it in detail and she said she had similarly experiences when she was younger and there were also two 'people?' I had never heard about it and mom is one of the most stable people you will ever meet! After one night of this experiance I was kind of asked? In my head if I wanted to go with them? Something I always said was I would go with if I ever had the chance lol ya sounds funny now anyway I said no I have a grandchild now. Are there other types of family conections like this? Thank you."],"Object Flight Path":"N/A"}
