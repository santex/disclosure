I did not notice this \"disc\" while taking the picture. We were in a rural area so noise wasn't an issue, but we heard nothing and saw nothing until I downloaded this picture to my computer. I took two consecutive pictures with a Nikon D60 and the \"disc\" was only in one of the two pictures. In the second picture, it is gone."],"Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Case Number":"10973"}
