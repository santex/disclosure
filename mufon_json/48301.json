I am always suspect and a natural debunker. There was a small cloud and it flew into that cloud so it was high up, it reappeared and kept on it's directional path and then it simily vanished."],"Longitude":"-76.037823","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-06212013-0011","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.936139,+-76.037823(48301)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48301) map </A>","Latitude":"41.936139","Case Number":"48301","Date of the Event":"06/20/2013 11:45 UTC","Summary":"Extremely bright, traveling fast, no lights other the solid color, not meteor or satelite or plane,","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Friendsville","There were no other sightings in Friendsville on or around June 20th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"06/21/2013 09:27 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48301.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48301.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
