{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Bright star changing colors","divs":["Sighting DetailsBright star glowing changing positions. Once it stopped for a few mins. I then took a picture. Never saw it again. But have seen a massive star ball with many small stars in it and then they just all broke loose and went up and hovered. There are alot of strange happenings in the area. Don't really talk about it anymore because not too many people believe. I know what I saw and have been seeing is not fake or a hoax. It's been going on for 3 years now and never goes away. Many different scenarios happen at all times of the year. Never have been freightened.....just curious. I believe I have seen alot of OMG if I was to tell someone they would just laugh at me."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Wilmington","There were no other sightings in Wilmington on or around July 25th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/22/2011 08:18 UTC","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Region":"Delaware","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32003.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32003_submitter_file1__0704092106.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32003.html"],"Longitude":"-75.540607","Latitude":"39.748303","Date of the Event":"07/25/2010 10:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"32003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.748303,+-75.540607(32003)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32003) map </A>","City":"Wilmington","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09222011-0015"}
