As we where passing this town called Kenny,TX . I was getting on the over pass i started to see a strait line of light passing right over us going towards the west . The lights were flying so low as if their were helicopters. I mean their was about 15 to 20 lights as big as baseballs . I slowed down and put down my window but their was no noise .
