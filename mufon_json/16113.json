I think it was last summer.It was on the evening news, At the Kalamazoo airport one of their passenger planes was flying at about 17,000 feet when the pilots heard a bang. When they landed there was a big round dent on the nose of the plane about the size of a large ball. There was no blood or feathers or anything else. They said birds can't fly that high. They hit somthing. You should give them a call. Kalamazoo - Battle Creek International Airport 269-388-3668. Also it was on Fox News or CNN News, sometime around 2003, I'm not sure, but the news person was in the feild reporting on whatever when she said her cameraman caught a spacecraft on film and to watch carfully. I'm not kidding, you can see the craft clear as a bell.It was a long cigar shape moving very fast. It was only there for a very few seconds, but it was a space craft. I don't know why but they never showed the film again, but if you want proof, find that film, you won't believe your eyes. P. S. I love your show U. F. O. HUNTERS, Keep up the good work."],"Case Number":"16113","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16113.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16113.html"],"City":"Kalamazoo","Date Submitted":"07/29/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Something round.","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Date of the Event":"07/29/2008 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-85.584239","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Kalamazoo","There were no other sightings in Kalamazoo on or around July 29th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.293567","Region":"Michigan"}
