{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting details i was watching h2 on tv last night and they were talking about area 51, so i brought up google earth and moved to the area and started looking around, and as i was going east on groom lake road i saw an anomaly. there was a shadow on the ground that didn't look right, so i zoomed in and saw what looks like a lifting body that i measured against an f-16 that is parked in area 51 and measure it to be over 300 feet wide. the shadow is only about 1\\3 of the aircraft as the bottom of it is cut off by another satellite photo. the google earth latitude and longitude are: 37'23'48.85n 115'278'02.48 w elev 4381. anybody can look it up on google earth, just south of groom lake road. if the original satellite photo was aquired, it might show the whole shadow and as most of the google earth photos i have seen are taken from the southeast to the northwest, if the original photo goes far enough south you may even get a picture of the aircraft that made the shadow."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Area 51","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"37.237162","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-115.809975","Region":"Nevada","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02122012-0010","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"35645","Date Submitted":"02/12/2012 04:32 UTC","Date of the Event":"02/11/2012 07:30 UTC","City":"Area 51","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Wings","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.237162,+-115.809975(35645)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35645) map </A>","Summary":"Picture of a shadow of a lifting body over 300 feet wide.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35645.html"]}
