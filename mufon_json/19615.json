(although a few with guts have expressed the desire too & am trying to coordinate a group effort to witness & film them from multiple locations surrounding the area). we need hi-tech gen3 nightvision zoom lenses (like astrovision) on pro camcorders (like sony's new line with exemor chips) and\\or spotlights to get better footage--plus radiation detection and other scientific measuring devices while the activity is going on. remote battery operated motion sensing equipment too. i can think of more if you give me time. i've never seen one actually sitting on the ground and exploration of the overgrown fields & woods with hedge clippers produced no signs of disturbance nor landing. the \"taos hum\" low-frequency sound is heard around my house & pro shop at an annoying level for several years--no direction can be determined & not heard by everyone. photographs of valley on flash reveal multiple orbs and white small \"tail\" shaped lights frequently also. faint small orbs recorded on nightshot video around us sometimes. i can see the faint orange orbs drop from the sky occasionally after dusk... my 'military grade' surveillance cam had recorded them before in b\\w and i couldn't understand how what i assumed was 'space debris' could be so big as to disappear beyond the treeline which is 500 feet away. now i know. sounds too incredible, doesn't it? is no one coming out here because they're afraid? or is it because i copyright all my work so the ones who charge for this kind of knowledge instead of sharing it for free like me have to pay? i have shared the footage with all the major tv stations and no one has even acknowledged it. it seems the time is ripe for the public to demand answers from the powers that be."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle, Other, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"19615","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
