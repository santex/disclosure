Most were solitary but two were near each other. At first we thought it was an ember from a firework, but it didn't die off. Then we thought it might be a helicopter but it looked like it was on fire and there was no noise. Each orb moved in a straight line; with the exception of the two that were together they were well-spaced out. We lost sight of each orb as it passed the treeline to the NE, then a new one would appear in the SE. We took multiple videos. What are these orbs?"],"Date Submitted":"07/04/2013 11:50 UTC","Latitude":"42.391273","Case Number":"48623","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"Illinois","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Long Lake","There were no other sightings in Long Lake on or around July 4th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
