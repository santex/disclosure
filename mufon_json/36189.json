I have done more filming and have some very interesting footage. I told some friends about the UFOs who went out and also saw them over Clinton and Plainfield, Indiana. Last night, I was talking by phone with a friend in South Dakota and I told him to go outside with binoculars and look around. He came back and told me there was one UFO that he could see. What he described matched what I've been seeing in Blanford. While he was watching the one in South Dakota I went out and saw several at the same time. One was directly over my house, but, rather high up. Look for human like shapes around the ufos. Every clear night they are here."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/06/2012 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36189.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36189.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/01/2012 03:22 UTC","Log Number":"US-03012012-0012"}
