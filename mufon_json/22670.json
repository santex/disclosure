It was during the summer of 1990. I was alone, bodyboarding out in the Gulf of Mexico when I saw an object appear over the horizon. As it moved closer in my direction, I became a little nervous and swam to shore. I watched this thing come within 20 to 30 feet from the shoreline. It wasn't your typical looking UFO you read about or see in the movies. It was only about 4 feet wide and 5 feet tall. It resembled a small outdoor air conditioning unit. The sun reflected off of it and the cover or shell of the object was spinning as it hovered just above the water. As I recall there were at least three other witnesses. We watched this object zig zag over the water for approximately 10 minutes until we could no longer see it as it headed back out into the Gulf. My guess is that it was probably something the Air Force was experimenting with. Some AIr Force guys probably got a good laugh watching us dopes standing on the beach freaking out."],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
