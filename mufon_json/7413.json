He said that he spotted a \"glowing\" orb above the trees, but thought it was the moon or a street-light, initially. The night was hazy. He went inside to get a camera (still thinking it was a \"blood-moon\"), came back out and took a snap shot. He states that he still did not believe that it was a UFO, so he went back inside to go to the bathroom. When he looked at the photograph after going to the restroom, he figured it was too different to be the moon on a hazy night. He stopped back outside to the spot and started looking for the object again, but it was nowhere to be found. My brother states that he feels \"apprehensive\" about looking out his window - thinking that he's gotten as close as he wants too."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Edinboro","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Edinboro","Date Submitted":"07/03/2007 12:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"7413","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7413.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7413_submitter_file1__EdinboroUFO(7-3-07).JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7413.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
