At first the \"balls\" looked like they might be from a fire or something. There was no fire around. They were bright as heck! 5 circles, or balls of very bright light, that went from large to small in size. They came across my windshield then took straight off in the sky. Maybe the size of dish plates, hard to tell. There is NO explanation of what they were!
