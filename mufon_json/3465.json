It was slightly cloudy. I was sitting in my backyard playing my Mario brothers on Gameboy when I look up and see some lights in the sky. At first I think plane but as I looked more at them they didn t really fit the pattern of a plane, This circular kinda thing that stood out against the clouds had lights on each end. A white one on two sides and on the other two sides it had four lights, they kept changing colors which really made me doubt it was a plane. I just watched for a little while until it disappeared into the horizon."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3465.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3465.html"],"trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were 2 other sightings in San Jose on or around March 20th 2005"],"Longitude":"-121.891496","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/20/2005 03:13 UTC","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.348096,+-121.891496(3465)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3465) map </A>"}
