There was heavy cloud cover and no stars were visible. One individual light moved closer and further from the 4 lights that were very close to each other, almost forming one object. It moved from Philadelphia over my house in South Jersey, toward the ocean. Whole event took about a half hour. The lights eventually stopped moving east of me, hovered for a long time, then disappeared into the clouds. The individual light that was following the grouping eventually moved further and further away until it disappeared. I see planes and helicopters everyday due to my proximity to the Philadelphia airport and this was neither. What really attracted my attention to it was the way that the lights that made up the small group weaved around each other. The lights were also star colored."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/28/2012 04:46 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"41219","Log Number":"US-07282012-0024","Date of the Event":"07/27/2012 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41219.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41219.html"],"City":"Evesham Township","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Evesham Township","There were no other sightings in Evesham Township on or around July 27th 2012"],"Summary":"Four lights very close and swirling around each other.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
