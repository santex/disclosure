The fog had started to clear and there was blue sky showing. I spotted two bright white spheres near each other to the north of our location and showed my husband where they were and the employee, he looked briefly but was not interested and left. The objects were about 35-45 degrees up in the sky to the north, just above the top of a tree. They were slowly moving to the west. About 2-3 minutes later I spotted a third one also moving to the west. They moved west for a little while then started moving south past the trees where we could not see them any longer. As they were moving south we were facing west and they appeared to be about 45-55 degrees up in the sky. The closest cross roads were Villas and Tablerock."]}
