I was actually trying to get a look at the supermoon when all of a sudden the bright moving light appeared. I said what the hell is that? She looked and saw it to as the other 3 lights followed. Thought it was a shooting star at first but no it wasn't. They appeared all 4 moving together somewhat a distance between them. We watched as they dissappeared over the tree line and continued to sit and watch for their return. Tried to get a picture the only pic i caught looks like a huge orb. It was pretty cool though. Wish I would of had my good camera out but only had my cell.I was so in shock of what I saw I was fumbling with my phone and then they were gone. They appeared slow moving."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.086346","Summary":"4 bright fire looking balls","Region":"Ohio","Date of the Event":"06/22/2013 09:23 UTC"}
