{"Summary":"lights in the sky","divs":["sighting detailsi was driving east on hwy 544 approaching the socastee area in south carolina, and i saw some lights in the sky. they were about a 45 degree angle east from the moon and appeared to be going in a easternly direction. i looked at them and they were beige\\tan in color. i saw 3 sets of 2 lights all the same color. they lights were laid out horizontal in the sky. 2 sets of lights were about level with each other in the sky, while one set was forward of the other 2, as if they were flying in formation. each \"object\" had 2 lights on them and no other lights. then the lights shut off... for approximately 10 seconds. i first thought with the color it might have been some thing like fireworks going off, but there was no explosion then lights then came back on, on all 3 objects for about 5 seconds. then the lights on the 2 objects on the left shut off again, while the 3rd object lights were still lit. then the light on the left side of the object shut off, and then appeared on the right side of the object next to the other light. that light then \"slid\" to the other side of the object, and went out and this same motion happened about 4 more times, then all lights went out, and i witnessed nothing else concerning this matter. i then turned on the local news on the radio and listened to see if anyone else might have heard about it."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-81.161724","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"02/20/2008 07:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/20/2008 07:10 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.843611,+-81.161724(9654)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9654) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.843611","Case Number":"9654","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"South Carolina","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9654.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9654.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-02202008-0010"}
