I suddenly got a strange feeling of being watched, my dog Heidi was whining to go out. As soon as I let her out she began barking, and throwing a fit. I looked out though the sliding door out the backyard to see what the deal was. I saw a huge, extremely bright (blinding), star like object in the sky above the neighbors roof (not directly above) about a mile away towards the north. It stayed there from 6:55pm to 6:59pm. Then it moved towards the east at amazing speed. All you could see was bright white light. It would stop moving, and then start again, in totally odd angles. Then the object just disappeared. At this point I was excited about whatever it was. With my recent excitement, my younger brother (age 14) came out to see too. What we saw next was many helicopters (quick ones) or planes (moved like helicopters); from the direction of Buckley Air force Base. There were 2 to start with (7:03). These helicopters began to circle the area; we went from backyard to front yard to see them. The star like object appeared dead stopped (same spot again) at 7:08. It then took off exactly the same way at 7:12. At this point you could hear the circling helicopters; there were about 6 of them (not sure). We watched them, back to front yard from 7:12 to 7:18. Then one more time we observed the star like object dead stopped (same spot again) 7:19 to 7:25. This time however, a spotlight moved back and forth towards or from the object and the ground about a 1 mile distance from each other (north to northwest). My mother also observed this from the kitchen window. It then took off in the same manor, and then disappeared. After these events we continued to watch and counted a total of 10 helicopters circling the area from 7:26 to 7:40. I also observed many dogs barking in the neighborhood and heard sirens. The whole event was very strange, but exciting. I���ve never seen anything like this!"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.730622,+-104.8252(9489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9489) map </A>"}
