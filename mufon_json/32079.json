{"Date of the Event":"09/22/2011 09:22 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","divs":["Sighting Detailsi had just pulled up to my boyfriends house and looked up to the night sky as I usually do because I love stars. I noticed something that looked like a a star formation but I eventually realized it was moving. There was a diagonal line of blinking lights and infront of it was a > shape. These blinking lights started moving all around eachother. I called my boyfriend to come outside as soon as I realized this and eventually everyone from inside the house came outside to witness the crazy objects in the sky. My feelings were pure amazement but my boyfriend started to get freaked out. The objects continued moving across the sky in different patterns until they were no longer visible. I also tried to capture this on my phone but nothing showed up but the night sky. After I felt very confused but still amazed at what I saw."],"Date Submitted":"09/25/2011 02:07 UTC","Region":"Louisiana","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32079.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32079.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.282504","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Slidell","There were no other sightings in Slidell on or around September 22nd 2011"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-89.775024","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"32079","City":"Slidell","Summary":"Orbs in diagonal line like 7 of them and 5 in a triangular form started moving all over making different shapes and eventually diassapeared","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Other","Log Number":"US-09252011-0013","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.282504,+-89.775024(32079)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32079) map </A>"}
