I said, \"What are you looking at\"? and he replied,\"Oh......... that UFO up there\" and I looked at it and thought....what the bleep!!!. It's too bad I didn't have a camera and nobody else did either. It was to the right of Camelback Mountain in Scottsdale, Arizona on March 5th, 2007 at around 7:30 am. and it was shaped like an upside down teardrop. It's color was a light grey. There were no other markings on it and nothing was around it. It was slow moving toward the NE direction for roughly 5 minutes or so and then flew over the right side of the mountain out of site. When I came home that night I told my wife about it because she is into UFO's, has been for a long time now, and is always going on & on about UFO's, aliens, and I use to say \"whatever\". Seeing that one that day though made me a believer. My wife is happy because I don't roll my eyes up or look at her like she is nuts anymore."],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"03/05/2007 07:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
