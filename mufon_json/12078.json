{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving on I-70 west through Indianapolis watching planes taking off when I noticed a shiny circle object at a much higher altitude than the planes that were taking off when all of a sudden the object just disappeared. The object to me didn't seem very large and made no movement in any direction. I watched the object for less than 30 seconds when it just disappeared. I found this strange because it was so shiny in clear Sky's it was very noticeable so I would see the object if it moved but I didn't, it was just gone."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12078.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12078.html"],"trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There were no other sightings in Indianapolis on or around August 13th 2008"],"Summary":"I noticed a shiny circle/oval shaped object when all of a sudden the object just disappeared.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-86.155364","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.778226,+-86.155364(12078)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12078) map </A>","Country":"United States","City":"Indianapolis","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/13/2008 04:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/13/2008 04:30 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Latitude":"39.778226","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"12078","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08152008-0005"}
