I saw nothing visually but when I placed the camera card into my computer I noticed that a object appeared at 5:32 according to the camera, then nothing in the series till 5:35 the object appears to have reappeared and moved in a northern direction. The fact it wasn't in the series for three minutes means it wasn't just some a passing blimp slightly out of focus. I am a private pilot, so I know a little about flying vehicles. A blimp which do visit SB very often would have moved in three minutes way out of the picture."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.430393,+-119.701674(37360)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37360) map </A>","City":"Santa Barbara","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Santa Barbara","There were 2 other sightings in Santa Barbara on or around April 10th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37360.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37360_submitter_file1__IMAG0065.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37360_submitter_file2__IMAG0072.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37360.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/10/2012 11:02 UTC","Log Number":"US-04102012-0023","Summary":"Accidentally photographed UFO","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.430393"}
