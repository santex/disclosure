{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were having a New Years Eve party, sitting outside by a fire, when my friend said look at the satellite. I looked up and seen a very bright light moving pretty fast across the sky. I don���t think I was a satellite because it seemed to be to close to earth and moving to fast. Never seen anything like it before other than a plane but there was no blinking lights and it was moving to fast to be a plane. It was moving in a straight line. As we watched, what looked like lights started shooting out of the side right side of it. We watched until we lost sight of it because of the two story houses in the area. About 20 minutes later we could seen it coming again. This time as it pasted over it started shooting red lights out of the front. I am not sure what we seen but if anyone has any ideas or seen it that night please let me know."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.754847,+-119.770016(6151)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6151) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-01142007-0001","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"6151","Date Submitted":"12/31/2006 08:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Fresno","There were no other sightings in Fresno on or around December 31st 2006"],"Longitude":"-119.770016","Latitude":"36.754847","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6151.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6151.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/31/2006 08:00 UTC","Summary":"bright round ball, shooting while lights from side red lights from front.","City":"Fresno","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
