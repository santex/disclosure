We were looking at the stars like we do quite often. We looked over to the South and saw a bright white light moving straight North. When it got about right east of us, it abruptly changed directions, and started heading towards an orange light that was stationary that we just noticed at that moment. The white light faded out, and at the same moment, the orange light started moving strait up very, very slowly. Then it changed directions and was moving up and to the North. Then, it stopped for about 30 seconds, then started moving North again. Then, this light disappeared abruptly also. It was absolutely calm at the time, and there was no sound at all being produced. There was also no clouds in the sky at all for the lights to disappear behind."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.971595,+-99.894263(46669)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46669) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"South Dakota","Case Number":"46669","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/07/2013 11:09 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"04/04/2013 09:20 UTC","Summary":"We saw a bright white light and an orange bright light.
