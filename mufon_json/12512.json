I had an eerie feeling that something was out there because this has happened to me several times before. I grabbed my camcorder (on tripod) and started looking to the left of the giant pine tree and there were two disc-shaped objects far out there. Just like before I knew if I zoomed in, the picture would be blurred beyond recognition so I snapped a few only after I saw them move in unison back and forth very quickly. I was going to take videos but after I snapped the last pic, they moved so fast to the right behind the pine tree and were gone. I went outside with my camera but they were nowhere to be found. This was not my first encounter, WE ARE NOT alone. An added note: I keep my window very clean, these were not bugs or dots on my window."],"Latitude":"40.94589","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Dome","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12512.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12512_submitter_file1__Aug292008147pm.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12512_submitter_file2__Aug292008150pm.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12512_submitter_file3__Aug292008153pm.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12512.html"],"Case Number":"12512","Log Number":"US-09172008-0007","Date of the Event":"08/29/2008 01:47 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.94589,+-81.483171(12512)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12512) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.483171","Region":"Ohio","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
