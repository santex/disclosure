The sighting lasted about 12 seconds, and as the object moved away I lost sight of it's silhouetted form. It appeared rather large, obscuring stars as it past over me. The night was quiet and still. It had no lights and made no sound. The UFO traveled from the northwest to the southeast at what I would call medium constant speed. I truly believe the object was a UFO."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"19578","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.112596,+-122.252957(19578)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19578) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/18/2009 01:30 UTC","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/22/2009 01:28 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.252957","Country":"United States","Summary":"Triangular grey object cruises overhead with no lights or sound","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19578.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19578.html"],"Log Number":"US-09222009-0007","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
