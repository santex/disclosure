{"divs":["sighting details was lying on sofa facing double windows looking out to the south,when i noticed two lighted objects going over the house in the north direction. wind was out of the north at the time, and the dusk just ended with a crystal clear sky with no haze or humidity. thought they may have been airplane lights but the color was of a fire orangish yellow. thought that was odd, but didn't react directly to it. after less than a minute, they came over again, keeping their relative spacing to each other. got up then and went out to the deck which is about 15 feet to the west of where i initially was. when i got out there the objects were now directly to the upper sw near the edge of the nieghbors willow tree. they had maintained their relative distance to each other, and were just coming around to changing their direction of movement. they were evidently low in relation to my rooftop as it hadn't taken me 15 seconds to reach my deck from the front room. they had made two passes over my roof and when i got out to see them, they immediately reversed their direction and began to sail off to the nw in about a 40 degree angle upward and accelerated steadily but not overly quick to the nw. at their closest, they appeared to be the size of 55 gal. barrels or large trash cans but no dark or metallic appearance to them. they displayed an appearance of a camp fire or fireplace fire. as if they were made of glass and a fire was lit in them. the fire wavered or rotated along the face of them. they were rectangular with the long dimension upright. called my son as soon as i percieved they were leaving, he got out there just to see them about 300 or 400 feet away. it was as if you were looking at an open door to a furnace but no dark or discernable structure could be seen outside of the fire. i noticed the light still in the sky even though the sun was down. one could see a dark gray\\blue in the sky and i'm sure that i would have seen an ocject such as a basket ball if one was to toss it up into the level of that tree. they subsquently accelerated up and away into the sky while we watched for approx. 1-1\\2 min. can't imagine what they could have been. but with them sailing around the way they did, changing direction, accelerating away, i'm sure they weren't wind driven burning objects; it was clear enough and would've appeared low enough to see the silhouette but we noted none. jetliners elsewhere in the sky that were much higher than these objects had easily visible sillouhettes due to the clear skies. if anyone has any further questions, please e- mail me and i'll try to add what i can. hope someone has some possible explaination for me. joe"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in South Elgin","There were no other sightings in South Elgin on or around June 1st 2008"],"Region":"Illinois","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.994194","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"06/01/2008 09:10 UTC","Longitude":"-88.2923","Summary":"cylindrical firey objects, rectangular, flying in syncronization.","Date of the Event":"06/01/2008 09:10 UTC","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"11055","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Cylinder","City":"South Elgin","Log Number":"US-06052008-0018","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.994194,+-88.2923(11055)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11055) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11055.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11055.html"]}
