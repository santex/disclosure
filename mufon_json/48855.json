I saw what looked like a bright blue glowing disk. I hovered about 600ft over the northern-most hangars. As I watched, it vanished. Looked like it disintegrated but more like turned on invisibility. It became no longer visible. The whole event took no time at all. At least not enough time for me to get my camera."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-117.31317","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in San Bernardino","There were no other sightings in San Bernardino on or around July 10th 2013"],"Case Number":"48855"}
