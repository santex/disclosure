But as I admired how bright it was, I noticed it's shape and intensity was very...inconsistent, for a lack of a better term. I felt kind of mesmerized, but then cautious. It seemed serene in nature, but I didn't quite understand what I was looking at. I just thought \"like the luster of a diamond. with intensity like a laser up close\" I ran inside for a second opinion from my folks, but they looked at it from half across the room through the window, then looked back at the tv and said it was a star. not very much was put into the observation, so I left it at that. went back out, and just couldn't help but feel excited about what I was looking at. But I had other things to do, so I just let it be. I figured if it was truly a cosmic event, be it UFO or a cosmic occurance, it's not really for me to do anything about it. But after seeing that, I couldn't help saying something this time."],"Log Number":"US-06152010-0006","Region":"Washington"}
