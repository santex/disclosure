I went around to the side of the house and was taking pictures of the chemtrails. I never even seen the object until I was checking my pictures on my digital camera. It is very hard to see the object without zooming in. This is the second time I have caught something on pictures I have taken within the past 2 years. I am putting the original photo on here as well as the one I just darkened a little so it is easier to see the object."],"City":"Strawberry Plains","Log Number":"US-04172012-0016","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.093502","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"37547","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Strawberry Plains","There was one other sighting in Strawberry Plains on or around April 16th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/17/2012 02:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Region":"Tennessee","Summary":"Black UFO/ object","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.093502,+-83.655287(37547)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37547) map </A>"}
