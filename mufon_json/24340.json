Further, at one point, there was a perfect triangle formed and on the sw, 10 o'clock position, it appeared something was pulled into the sun, bounced off and appeared as a contrail. After arriving at Oxford Walmart, while waiting in the car for my husband and a mechanic, I looked up and saw what appeared to be a capsule like object, matte silver with a black band heading on a sw trajectory. I estimated it to be approximately 20,000 ft. AGL (above ground level) moving relatively slowly, however, the sky was clear and it appeared to fade completely. No sound, contrail, etc. Am beginning to observe strange things over Ohio and Indiana, lately."],"Summary":"Saw orbs going to sun.","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/01/2010 06:00 UTC","Case Number":"24340","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.506997,+-84.745231(24340)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24340) map </A>","Latitude":"39.506997","Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"US-07072010-0039","Region":"Ohio","Longitude":"-84.745231","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
