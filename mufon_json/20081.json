I saw it by a bike trail. i was siting cross leged when it came up behind me i kinda froze. i turned my head and got a really good look at it. it was a huge black 4 leged spider. it could move alot alot faster then any spider on this planet. it kinda almost ran away with all its 4 legs moving like a 4 leged tripod on the run. when i got up to leave the area i could hardly walk couse of just the presince of the thing. recently i have herd and fealt the same presince with clicking or hissing that seems to come out of noware.i have done some reserch and have found files on the yellows witch might be the hisses and preditors witch might be the clicking.all of it when u hear it or get near them u just want to leave.i dont really cheak my email so u can call me to get fearther info.i also felt kind of the same thing as the spider but could not see it just i think it might be some kind of very large centipede. just the ora that this centiped gives off will clear out a room of delta force commandos.this is not a joke im not just wrighting all this for fun i attached my email that i hardly cheak . thanks -sean"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20081.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20081.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-94.6765","trends":[],"Region":"Minnesota","Source":"MUFON"}
