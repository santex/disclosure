Looked up and noticed yellow light stationary in the sky. I did not have my glasses on and could not focus on it well enough to get a good idea how high it was. It was hazy out and the light was penetrating the haze at about normal cloud level. The light then faded off over a period of about 3 seconds. It then faded back on in about 1 second. Still in the same stationary position. I said to myself, if this thing starts moving, I'm running to get my glasses and phone. It then started moving in a zig-zag path. I went to get my glasses and phone. Returned within 15 seconds and light was no longer there. I waited for 20 minutes for it to reappear but it never did."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lake Saint Louis","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Longitude":"-90.77643","Region":"Missouri","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"None"}
