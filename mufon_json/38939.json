It was faint at first but grew brighter and appeared to be going faster headed northwest. The stranger part was quite a bit back behind it I saw a flashing strobe like light appear out of nowhere and looked like what seemed to me like it was chasing it. It gradually started catching up to it as they both sped up! Both the steady glowing orb and the flashing light traveled from northeast in a counterclockwise circular pattern all the way around across the sky's horizon in a 3 quarter circle radius. After about 5-6 minutes of watching these lights travel across the sky in circular pattern the flashing light that was behind the other got up very very close to orange orb light and suddenly stopped flashing and was gone. The other orb light kept traveling but I lost it as soon as it got real close to the moon due to full moons brightness. I have never seen anything like that and won't forget it either.."],"City":"Carson","Summary":"steady orange orb makes circular pattern all across night sky chased by flashing strobe of light","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"06/07/2012 05:25 UTC","Latitude":"33.810971","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/06/2012 01:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"38939","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Carson","There were no other sightings in Carson on or around June 6th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON"}
