So I said take a picture of it and she did take two through the front windshield. Later that knight she calls me again and said she sees a weird object again this time it was knight time. Again i told her to take a picture and she did. The pictures were made with here cell phone camera. She sent them to me on my phone and i really couldn't see anything on my phone. Months went by and i didn't think about them until i was deleting picture off my phone when i came across them and decided to take a better look at them.
