We all looked up out of the car windows and saw 2 stationary red-orange spheres kind of star-like but bigger. They were just hovering there. Then I go and get out of the car and so does everyone else and they were gone. We waited and looked around for about 5 minutes but they vanished. My friend took a video but then when we went back to look at it the phone said that there was no more memory."],"City":"New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49516.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49516.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"None moving, two parellel/perpendicular red-orange spheres hovering stationary.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Case Number":"49516","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.718823","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were 2 other sightings in New York on or around August 5th 2013"],"Object Features":"Other","Date Submitted":"08/05/2013 10:50 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"New York","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.718823,+-74.002123(49516)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49516) map </A>"}
