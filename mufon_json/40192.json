{"divs":["Sighting Details1. My husband works midnights and I was walking with him out the door to say goodbye. 2. It was a fairly large object that was directly in my line of view. 3. I had no idea and my husband didn't either, we have never seen anything like it! 4. It looked like an orange fireball, it had a floating appearance but there was not even a breeze, It seemed to be moving pretty quick and it was following a distinct south to north straight line path. 5. Very shocked and in awe, I am certain I frightened my husband when i started yelling \"what the heck is that!\" Afterwords I wish I would have grabbed my camcorder! 6. My husband and I both watched as it flew over my neighbors house and half way across the field, in mid flight and in the middle of the field it just disappeared!"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40192.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40192.html"],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 02:43 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-89.750099","Case Number":"40192","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.250048,+-89.750099(40192)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40192) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Illinois","Country":"United States","Latitude":"38.250048","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Marissa","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Marissa","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange Orb/fireball in rural area","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07052012-0030","Date of the Event":"07/05/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City"}
