My wife and I were celebrating our birthdays (we both have the same birthday) on vacation heading west on 217 driving through Palo Duro Canyon in Texas 2. My wife was looking out the window and saw this odd shaped object coming from the north heading towards us at incredible speed. 3. We had no idea what it was, We had never seen anything like it before. 4. The thing was shaped kinda like a spool of thread first heading straight at us then when it got to about 100 ft away it slowed down then turned and started pacing our car at the same speed as us. 5. I was astonished at the sight but me wife was very afraid. She still has trouble talking about it. 6. I don't know if it just flew away in an instant or just vanished but it was there and then suddenly it disappeared just as another car approached us."],"Summary":"Spool shaped object","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date Submitted":"08/06/2011 03:23 UTC","City":"Canyon","Date of the Event":"04/01/1947 03:00 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Canyon","There were no other sightings in Canyon on or around April 1st 1947"],"Source":"MUFON"}
