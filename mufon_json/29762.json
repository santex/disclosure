After watching it approach our direction for a couple of minutes; I asked my husband if he noticed any flashing lights coming from it and he confirmed he saw no flashing lights either. There also was no sound coming from the object. We both watched it for another couple of minutes until it was just north of our location. It appeared to be about 500-1000' above the ground. The light then quickly shot up and ascended in the sky until it disappeared."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.106978,+-84.50657(29762)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29762) map </A>","Case Number":"29762","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","City":"Cincinnati","Region":"Ohio"}
