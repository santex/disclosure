I did not say anything because I always make comment about UFO's and my girlfriend tells me to stop because I scare her, but this time she spoke up and said, \"Wow I just felt like you for a second. I could've sworn I just saw something fly across the sky.\" I think she noticed me looking into the sky as well and I responded to her in less than a second explaining what I had seen as well. A bright white light just shot faster than my eyes could follow across the sky and seemingly disappeared into the night sky. When the light flew across the sky we were seeing it through a little bit of branches in the trees, but it was clearly in the sky and not just a reflection off the trees."],"Object Shape":"Flash","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Marshall","There were no other sightings in Marshall on or around December 11th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-12122011-0010","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.323023","Case Number":"33984","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Longitude":"-84.927003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.323023,+-84.927003(33984)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33984) map </A>","City":"Marshall","Date of the Event":"12/11/2011 07:30 UTC","Summary":"U.F.O. in the country","Source":"MUFON"}
