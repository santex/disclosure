I only stopped to get some pictures with the same camera which reveal a cloud by the object then I filmed another 2 minutes. It is way to bright to be able to see exact detail but I will upload them along with both movies. Whatever it was is still there! When I was filming I noticed it was cloudy! So whatever it is it's below the cloud cover! Keep an eye open and a camera on, just look up each night you're more than likely to see something! And don't be afraid to report it!"],"City":"North Webster","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Star-like, Unknown","Longitude":"-85.695785"}
