We heard a sound that started off sounding like rapid shot gun fire in the distance. It then continued and got louder and louder and turned into a popping rumblings jet and thunder type noise. It continued on and was so loud that it was alarming. I went outside and took a video which only picked up sound. My wife was so alarm buy it that she wanted to call the police. We immediately checked to see if there was something on the news about a plane crash bomb or something like that. The sound was so loud a continuous that it was quite terrifying.
