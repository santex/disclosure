It did this three times. I was in City Of Industry and it seemed liked it could be over the La Habra or furher south. I was standing in the back yard of a friends home and I brought it to their attention and they saw the second event. In total it lasted approximate five minutes. I noticed because it was so shiny like I have never seen before and moved so quickly like I had never seen. I thought it was a UFO. I almost didn't want to write this because I felt silly, but what I saw was something I will never forget or I have ever experienced. If some one else had this experience please, I would like to know."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Oval","Sighting Duration":"00:05:09","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Industry","There were no other sightings in Industry on or around August 22nd 2008"],"Date of the Event":"08/22/2008 09:30 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"08/22/2008 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
