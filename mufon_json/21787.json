I was looking up through the sunroof at the clear blue sky...nothing else on my mind but going home...I am a very reliable Business Owner and this is something I have dealt with for a few months and have decided it needs to be reported... We were headed south on 285 and we were near the Atlanta Airport...I will reitterate that this was not a plane or anything simular...I was very coherent... Out of the deepest part that you can see when lookin up at the blue sky, I saw a large ROUND GOLD METAL (no lights) very detailed object appear...it was stationairy and the object did not fly in any direction...it was stationary...I am very familiar with planes, etc...I thought it might be a satellite or something but after researching...no way... It appeared to be about the size of 5-10+ planes in width from the height it was at compared to planes, and, appeared to have lost it's invisability for a miniute or so because before I could get my emotions in tact and grab my cell phone to take a picture it started to dissappear again out of site with a slight fog around it then nothing?...Just the clear blue sky again?"],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Log Number":"US-02062010-0002","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 95 other sightings in Atlanta","There were no other sightings in Atlanta on or around November 12th 2009"],"Region":"Georgia","Longitude":"-84.382592","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.757485,+-84.382592(21787)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21787) map </A>","City":"Atlanta","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"33.757485","Date of the Event":"11/12/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21787.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21787.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"21787","Country":"United States","Summary":"Stationairy Gold Round Detailed Metal Large object appeared out of clear blue sky..."}
