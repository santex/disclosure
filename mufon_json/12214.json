I am simply looking straight up. On my final day in Brazil I took this piture in the morning, the sky was perfectly blue, hence the reason for my picture. I have finally downloaded my pictures onto my computer and when reviewing them I see this in the picture. I did not see this in reality, only in the picture. It is unidentifiable and flying and some sort of object so I think qualifies as a UFO."],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Rio de Janeiro","There were no other sightings in Rio de Janeiro on or around August 21st 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12214.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12214_submitter_file1__IMG_0940.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12214.html"],"Tags":"City","City":"Rio de Janeiro","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"-22.899839","Country":"Brazil","Date Submitted":"08/21/2008 07:19 UTC","Region":"Rio de Janeiro","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Unidentified object found in picture from trip","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:00"}
