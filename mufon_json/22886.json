My boyfriend, who was driving, asked what I was looking at. When he looked, I asked, \"is that a star?\" because it didn't look like it was moving. He said it wasn't a star but he couldn't tell what it was. he asked it if was moving and almost like it was waiting for someone to notice it, it started moving. at first slowly south or south west. It went from moving slowy to moving so fast it disappeared behind the tree line. It was cigar shaped and very reflective. My boyfriend and I can't agree on the size, but it wasn't small. He thinks it was about twice the size of a Cessna By the time I realized it was something worth taking a picture of it was too late."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22886.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22886.html"],"Region":"North Carolina","Longitude":"-81.668262","Date Submitted":"04/19/2010 12:37 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.224615","Summary":"Hung in the sky for a few seconds before darting off","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.224615,+-81.668262(22886)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22886) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar, Teardrop","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Boone","There were no other sightings in Boone on or around April 18th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/18/2010 07:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
