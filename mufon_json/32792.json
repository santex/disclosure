Because of the orange-red glow it was emitting, I was concerned it was an airplane that had caught on fire. I ran outside to watch it to see if it was losing elevation and was going to plummet to the ground. It's movement was slower than a plane and there was no noise. When I first saw it, it was heading from East to West. It suddenly took a 90 degree turn and started heading due North. It abruptly stopped and hovered for a couple of minutes. I was SO excited, I ran into the house and upstairs to summon my husband to see it. He looked out the back window and saw it too. Then, it disappeared from sight in a the blink of an eye."],"Longitude":"-84.294382","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32792.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32792.html"],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Milford","There were no other sightings in Milford on or around October 22nd 2011"],"City":"Milford","Case Number":"32792","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.181388,+-84.294382(32792)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32792) map </A>","Latitude":"39.181388","Summary":"Not close enough to see the object, only lots of lights that looked like it was on fire."}
