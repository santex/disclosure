At first I thought it was a bird but then as I got closer I could see that It was hovering and then wobbling shortly afterwards. Since I had my camera with me, I took two photos. One while it was wobbling and another when it was stationary. I tried to get closer and take a third but then it took off at a very high speed. When I zoomed in on the stationary photo, I could see what I thought was a dome and windows, but I am not sure. This was the fourth UFO, I have observed. Ever since I saw my first UFO, at the age of ten, I have been fascinated with the subject and have watched many documentaries on the Topic. I will continue to keep my eye on the sky."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50065.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50065.html"],"Latitude":"35.713017","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-08222013-0013","Region":"North Carolina"}
