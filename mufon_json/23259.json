The object was approx. 2 to 4 miles west and perhaps at 4000' in altitude. It was traveling due north. The object was silver and was reflecting the morning sun. It also appeared to be tumbling as the flashes were irregular in frequency and duration. The object was visible between the flashes and although I could not determine a definate physical shape it could have been triangular. After about 45 seconds the object turned to the NW and shortly after went out of visual range."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Tifton","Date Submitted":"05/13/2010 02:22 UTC","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"Flashing Object","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.456883,+-83.505697(23259)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23259) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/11/2010 10:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Tifton","There were no other sightings in Tifton on or around May 11th 2010"],"Region":"Georgia","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"23259","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23259.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23259.html"],"Log Number":"US-05132010-0007"}
