It has been following me or seems to be. I don't remember when I first noticed it. I thought I might be something I was seeing due to stress. I thought it was a meteor shower. It would hover then dance in a clockwise motion then hover then move towards me in a straight path. Then it would disappear and reappear. This has happened on many occasions. I am highly educated and I collected as much evidence as possible. I have been recording as much as I can when possible. It has been visible night and day. I told people who all decided that I need a psychiatric evaluation. I continue to see the objects and I am SICK OF people being so wrapped up in their selfish motives and iphones that they DON'T listen to anything I say. I have not had time to watch all the videos I will post them tomorrow. Thank you for being truthful and open minded."],"Summary":"strange balls of light that I have seen for 2 months on many occasions I have videos of some of them"}
