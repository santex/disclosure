I noticed a very bright reflective object .First It caught my attention because of how bright it was. I pulled my camera up to look at it and Icouldn't see it.Then after maybe 30 secs it was clearly visible. i took 8 pictures at high shutter speed. I was in disbelief at what I was seeing. I eventually lost the object. When I went home I loaded the chip on the computer and was shocked. I could see it clearly. It must have been rotating because it was a different look in the pictures. I also noticed 2 orbs in the object which I didn't notice until I looked at the picture.The orbs were reddish in color and seemed to be in geometric formation."],"Date of the Event":"10/27/2012 02:30 UTC","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Other","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-118.828694","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Thousand Oaks","Log Number":"US-10282012-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43562.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43562.html"],"Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Disc"}
