Approaching my vehicle I immediately noticed movement above the treeline to the west. There was still some light from the sun but not much. It looked like an enormous cloud of dim fireflies or charged particles\"blooming\". Went back into house and told wife and son to take a look, both saw the same when we went out to the yard. Aurora is not uncommon here, but i've seen it enough to know what it looks like. This was hundreds of many small light sources that was sustained, unlike fireworks which fade. I have never seen anything like it!"],"Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","Latitude":"46.565709","Date of the Event":"09/26/2013 08:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-09272013-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51113.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51113.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
