That's when I heard a carnival ride noise and turned around, that's when I saw a big triangle shaped thing flying over my cousins neighbors house. I didn't know what the heck it was. It was a triangle shape. It had round edges and was flat on bottom and top. The object was making a whooshing noise and had red lights on each corner on the bottom. I can't remember if it had a white light in the middle, I think it did. It was moving very slowly and very close to the ground. I was shocked and excited. I called my cousin and we watched it together. It went behind and tree and we never saw it again."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-119.100566","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Country":"United States","Summary":"triangle with round edges red lights on bottom of each edge","Date Submitted":"07/01/2007 10:00 UTC","City":"Pasco","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11293.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11293.html"],"Region":"Washington","Date of the Event":"07/01/2007 10:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"46.239579"}
