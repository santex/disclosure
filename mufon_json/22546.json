{"Region":"Wisconsin","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-89.329687","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the opening day of a Monona Grove High School football game i walked through the admision and looked up. i saw what looked and behaved like a shooting star. it came from left to right, appeared like a star and disappeared just before the tree line, like a shooting star might. i would say shooting star was what i saw except 2 factors 1. it was at a football game with lights and all that and that would make it hard to see a shooting star. i will however give credit that if you go near where the players have practice behind the bleachers you can see the stars. 2. i watched many shooting stars 2 nights in a row just before the sighting. they are hard to see with many lights. which reminds me we saw what we thought were airplanes chasing each other and probly what it was but thats another story. call me crazy and just making up it was a ufo and not a shooting star but i stand behind my experience, and will back it up."],"Date Submitted":"03/28/2010 11:02 UTC","Summary":"UFO that looks like shooting star darts through lit up sky at hs football game.","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"22546","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.071619","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.071619,+-89.329687(22546)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22546) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Monona","There was one other sighting in Monona on or around August 15th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03282010-0015","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22546.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/15/2009 07:05 UTC","City":"Monona"}
