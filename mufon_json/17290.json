M when I noticed a bright light through my window toward the east. I thought it was an airplane or helicopter at first, but realized that it was not anything like that after watching it for a while. I decided to look at it through my binoculars. It looked like streaks of light. I tried my video camera, but could not get a picture. Finally I used my digital flash camera and was able to get some pictures. It appeared to be a round ball of light far away. When I zoomed with my camera as far as I could, I could see two distinct separate objects which looked like round or cylindrical shapes with a liquid substance coming down from one of them. They appeared to have ridges on one side and feet, maybe to land on. They looked like shiny metal. They moved together appearing to be one at a distance as though they were connected in some way. I was afraid that it would see me with my flashing light on my camera. It did move closer to my house and at one point was straight up over my house, but still at a distance. When I stopped taking pictures, it moved further away looking smaller and smaller as it went up higher. I was too tired by 5:00 A. M. and had to go back to bed, but it was still there. I was a little frightened and my cat was agitated and crying most of the night."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There were no other sightings in Austin on or around May 31st 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Case Number":"17290","Date of the Event":"05/31/2009 01:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-06012009-0010","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"I saw one bright light in the sky which did not appear to move but hovered for hours.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.270593,+-97.739061(17290)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17290) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Star-like","Latitude":"30.270593","Tags":"City","City":"Austin"}
