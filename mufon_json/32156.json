{"Latitude":"38.432494","Longitude":"-82.69682","Date of the Event":"09/11/2011 07:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI am a local photographer here in Boyd County Ky. On September 11, 2011 I was taking individual football pictures of some boys at Boyd County High School. I was shooting back towards the east. I did not notice anything in the picture while I was taking them. However after I got home and was reviewing the shots, I saw a small light in the distance in one of the pictures. I zoomed the picture in to see what it was, and it appears to be an inverted stealth bomber. It was dark on top and lighter on the bottom. The next day our newspaper ran an article about UFO sightings over the weekend in Boyd Co. I had not said a word to anyone about this. I was also informed that about 50 or 60 people in Seattle Washington saw the same object I photographed 3 hours after I took the pictures. Picture 1 is full length shot and you can see a small light in the distance over his shoulder. Picture 2 is zoomed in and can be zoomed in to 400% for viewing."],"Case Number":"32156","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/28/2011 04:59 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32156.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32156_submitter_file1__king11.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32156_submitter_file1__king11.jpg.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/32156_submitter_file2__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32156.html","/var/www/straped/mufon/test/32156_submitter_file1__king11.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/test/32156_submitter_file1__king11.jpg.jpg"],"Summary":"Captured in a photoshoot in Boyd Co Ky","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Ashland","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.432494,+-82.69682(32156)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32156) map </A>","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Ashland","There were no other sightings in Ashland on or around September 11th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-09282011-0014","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Kentucky","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States"}
