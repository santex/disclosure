{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was a relatively clear Saturday afternoon, my girlfriend and I were at the local High School ( San Pasqual High ) getting ready to jog on their track. We were on top of the hill that overlooks the stadium when we saw a bright star-like object approach from the East. As it came closer its shape became more apparent, more boomerang shaped but very smooth. The top side was made of what appeared to be a highly reflective gold colored metal. The bottom of the object was the color of dull bronze and didn't really seem to reflect the light. I had my backpack with me and luckily inside it was my camera, so in haste I quickly retrieved my camera and ran closer to the object. It made absolutely no sound and it initially moved very slowly. Too slow for an airplane to fly. As it approached us the object banked to the north and after about 30 seconds reversed it's direction revealing it's side to us. We watched if for some time as it banked back and forth, then all of a sudden it tipped it's nose to about a 45 degree angle and quickly ascended out of sight. It was completely out of sight after about three seconds. I wasn't afraid when I saw the object, just fascinated by it's erratic movements and it's beauty. It truly was a beautiful thing to behold."],"Date Submitted":"06/17/2007 03:17 UTC","Log Number":"US-06192007-0011","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"00:12:00","Latitude":"33.121937","City":"Escondido","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.121937,+-117.077391(7257)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7257) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7257.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7257_submitter_file1__IMG_0579.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7257_submitter_file2__IMG_0580.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7257_submitter_file3__IMG_0581.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7257.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Case Number":"7257","Summary":"Boomerang shaped UFO","Date of the Event":"06/17/2007 03:17 UTC","Longitude":"-117.077391","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Escondido","There were no other sightings in Escondido on or around June 17th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
