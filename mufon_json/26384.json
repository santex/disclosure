There were alot of cool looking clouds looking west. My girlfriend tells me to look at this weried cloud. She points at it and i see it. It looked like a pencil. the clouds are horizontel but this was vertical too the clouds. Within a couple of minits some bright object came from behind this pencil shaped cloud. We were not expecting that too happen. Once it came out it hovered next too that odd pencil shaped cloud. About 30 seconds later i go to get sum binocluars. Was in house for a minit. Couldn't find them, so I came back out by that time it was gone. My girlfriend tells me the object that came from behind the clould went north all quick and was gone. Seconds later she looked for that cloud but it was gone. Our feelings were perplexed. Just was wierd"]}
