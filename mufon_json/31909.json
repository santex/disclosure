She wishes to be anonymous. Around 8 pm,she,and others saw several amber colored objects moving through the sky. Pictures and a video were taken. They moved away somewhat quickly behind rooftops.Also in the area were helicopters. I also witnessed these helicopters. There were around 3-4 at this same time. I saw the pics and video.These weren't flares,meteors,and didn't look like conventional aircraft. Didn't hear any noise. She called me to say something was flying near her and she didn't know what it was. I told her to calm down,get her 12mp camera and get pics and vid.She was excited,but she got the them.
