I saw this light, about the size of a golf ball but it was very high in the night sky and I've seen very bright satelites before, and didn't think much of it at first..It came out of the south, and as it came to be over head it stopped. It then proceeded to flash, a bit like a camera flash only You could almost see like an aura surrounding what ever it was. It then made a 90 degree movement to the west where again it stopped and the flashing resummed, it the continued out of sight to the north. I madfe note of the time which was around 11:30 pm or so,,and thought if this was something of ours, it should be there the next night...So at 11:00 pm i was out side again and nothing reappeared...To my knowledge We don't have Sats. that can stopped dead then move in 90 degree paterns....Also there was no sound.."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"46272","Longitude":"-80.510221","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.854641,+-80.510221(46272)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46272) map </A>","City":"Delhi","Region":"Ontario","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"CA-03182013-0008","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46272.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46272.html"]}
