We were on playground and someone said, \"Hey, look at that\", and we turned and looked to see 3+ silvery objects hovering off in the west, sort of traveling east. They suddenly made a sharp right turn. While doing so, a teacher ordered us to get back inside the school, but I continued to watch as I walked and the objects made swift movement west and disappeared. All were flying together in a pattern. It was the talk of the school for a few days. I don't know if the incident made the papers because I didn't read papers as a child. I know that during the 1950's there were many similar sightings in California. We had Edwards AFB east of us, but they had nothing like this and they were coming from that direction and actually turned and went the other way. I've often thought of trying to advertise the event and see if any of my fellow students would agree they had seen it."],"Summary":"Several of us kids on school playground & teachers observed.
