sure. could i maybe not have that good of eyesight since i am getting older? sure. i personally don't believe that is the case but i don't want to feel like some kind of idiot so i am gonna hit send and report it. i hope you do the same if you have seen things in this area of north phoenix."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26645.html"],"Region":"Arizona","Tags":"City","Summary":"bright white cigar shaped object in north phoenix","Date of the Event":"11/17/2010 08:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Phoenix","Case Number":"26645","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around November 17th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.450677,+-112.065727(26645)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26645) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
