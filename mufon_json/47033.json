{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Detailsmy wife and i just walked outside from a friends birthday party. While my wife unlocked the car door i looked up at the sky and saw about 6 reddish orange lights in the sky. the lights all seemed to be equal distance from each other. the first few were a little higher than the trailing lights. they moved at a very slow rate from left to right in the sky, very slow. after a minute or so the lights started to disappear. the direction that i saw them, there is an airport that way. but these did not seem like normal airplane lights. they were unusual with so many so close and all moving uniformly through the sky. then they just disappeared."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"6 lights moving slowly left to right then dissapear","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"04/28/2013 02:43 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47033.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47033.html"],"Longitude":"-119.414342","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/27/2013 10:34 UTC","Log Number":"US-04282013-0005","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":[],"Case Number":"47033","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"36.788181","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.788181,+-119.414342(47033)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47033) map </A>"}
