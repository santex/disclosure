This night it was 8:35 pm when I saw it was there. It twinkles to the naked eye but when seen thru binonculars it is similar to looking at a ferris wheel from the side veiw with the lights going ..twinkling & blinking. I also seems to move...possibly rotate because it also can be veiwed as a elongated shape...then it comes back into the sphere shape. Lights are white ...red & possibly blue or green...The object stayed in view until 9;10 pm when it seemed to fade somewhat but then was just gone...even when I checked with the binoculars. MY husband & son also wee out when this was spotted & both also saw it with & without binoculars. I also was speaking with a friend who lives about 7 miles from me. She , her husband & their son also verifeied what I was seeing. They saw it & described it to me as the very same object I was seeing. The next morning I talked with Judy from MUFON."],"Longitude":"-84.05604","Latitude":"42.02436","Log Number":"US-10022008-0008","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"09/30/2008 08:35 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown"}
