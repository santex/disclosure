It seem as they were floting its hard to explain. I told my sister maybe it was a pole with lights or something but as we took a good look at it they seem to be flying slowy.Then the first circle went off and the other two went off a second from each other and they disapeared. then a minute later the three of them camback but now the were in a straight line and then a gain they turned off one by one we waited to see if they came back but we did not sow them again. My sister and her family started screaming that they were UFO's i told them that maybe the'll say something in the news that maybe it was one of those testing things that the military do i hope some else beside us sow it to come to a conclution of what it was. We werent able to take a pic or video tried using my cellphone but i was too dark and it all happened so fast that i my self still dont know what to make of it. I hope someone might of had a chance to record it."],"Case Number":"9745","Log Number":"US-02282008-0005","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9745.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9745.html"],"Longitude":"-119.416802","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.785601,+-119.416802(9745)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9745) map </A>","Date Submitted":"02/27/2008 08:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
