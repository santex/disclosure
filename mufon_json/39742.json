{"Region":"New York","divs":["Sighting DetailsSaw this UFO in my backyard on the evening of 6-10-12. Appeared stationary but seemed to be spinning rapidly. Remained visible for approximately 5 minutes.It never seemed to move at all during aside from what appeared to be an on axis spinning motion. We never saw it leave..it just disappeared.I Shot a series of RAW 18MP images. Photographed using full zoom 135mm lens.Object still appeared hard to discern during shooting. Blown up images reveal an object which is still impossible for me to identify. Also recorded HD video but its very shaky. I'm hoping to get it stabilized before sharing."],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Utica","There were no other sightings in Utica on or around June 10th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"Saw this object in my backyard on the evening of 6-10-12.
