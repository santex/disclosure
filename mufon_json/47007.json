I caught sight of it out of the corner of my eye. At first I thought it was a star or a plane but it didn't move. I told my family and they all saw it. And about 30 minutes before when we were at Fudgies for icecream , my sister saw it far off above the trees west off of route 22. Then coming home we turned on to chestnut ridge road by the farm and looked and it just blinked and disappeared. This is the 4th time we've seen it in Dutchess County."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04262013-0018","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"04/26/2013 08:40 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Dover Plains","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
