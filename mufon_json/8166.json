As we neared our home, we noticed a bright light in the western sky. It was far too large to be a planet. The light remained stationary with rays of red and gold radiating from its golden corona. We studied it for several moments. When it seemed that the object was not going to move, we raced into the house to retrieve a pair of binoculars, and to notify family members. When we returned outdoors just seconds later, the object had vanished."],"Region":"Wisconsin","Longitude":"-89.39429","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"8166","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.076162,+-89.39429(8166)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8166) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8166.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8166.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Country":"United States","Summary":"large bright light emitting rays of red and gold from a gold corona","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
