CST I went out my kitchen door to take the trash out. The door faces east. The moon was just about full that evening. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a strange ���������cloud��������� to my right. It was strange enough that I turned to look at it. It was moving from the south to the north very fast. It was about 70 -75 degrees off the horizon and dark grey. The shape is what first caught my attention. Imagine an iPhone lying flat but there was a large ���������dome shape��������� under it and in the middle of the rectangle. The ���������dome��������� seemed to have several lobes on it so it was not perfectly smooth. In fact the whole object was about the size of an iPhone held at arm���������s length. There was only one object. It did not make any sound. In fact I would say the silence was ���������deafening��������� in the same way it is quiet after a large snowfall. The moon was quite bright and the edges of the object seemed to glow from the moonlight rather than an internal source. The object obstructed the view of stars as it flew by. I walked down the side path to the front of my house to keep the object in view. It continued straight north. The speed and altitude did not alter. I continued to watch it until it disappeared from view. There were no aircraft in the area at the time. The sky was clear that except for a few wispy, white clouds that are shaped more like long pencils. I watched the object fly under the clouds and noted that the object was not only moving in the opposite direction of the clouds, but it was going much faster than the clouds. It moved fast enough that I knew I did not have time to get my camera. Plus it was dark enough that I was not sure the object would photograph. My dog was outside with me and he started barking when the object was in front of me. I watched the object for approximately one minute before I could no longer see it. I was home alone. I am a mom and a business owner. Unfortunately, I did not see any of my neighbors outside who I could ask to witness the object. The next night I looked up at the sky watching the clouds move. I realized that the moonlight hitting the edges of the clouds was rather diffuse. The object I saw on January 8 was enveloped by moonlight that was quite bright ��������� as though the object reflected the moonlight. But the object did not seem to be shiny to me at the time of sighting."],"Longitude":"-90.189454","Case Number":"14872","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"01/08/2009 06:09 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.634812,+-90.189454(14872)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14872) map </A>"}
