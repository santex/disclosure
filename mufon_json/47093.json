Somewhere in 2002-2003, I was out getting the mail and having a cigarette, and looked up for a second, and saw something unusual. It looked like a full, silver orb, hovering in the sky to the SSW direction, maybe a few miles away and unknown feet above. I wasn't sure if it was an airplane or something at the time, but as I observed it, about 15-30 seconds later, the object ascended rapidly both horizontally & vertically into the sky in the same position it was, almost on a 45 degree angle. I saw a photo of the same object on the internet that was from Glendale, Arizona, but cannot remember where, but it was the same object I saw. It has been many years and didn't thank anything of it, but maybe it could be of help to you gentlemen."]}
