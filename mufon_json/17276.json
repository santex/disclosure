We grabbed the binoculars and were still unable to make out what they were. We continued to watch them as they slowly traveled east. One disappeared and then a red diamond fluttery type of object appeared closer above us and appeared to be moving straight up above me. My daughter saw one flash west across the sky and disappear. She described it well as a crystal diamond, spiky thing, it was sparkling and changing colors. Very bizarre we have never seen anything like it. My daughters friend just called and reported seeing two red flashes in the sky as well."],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Diamond","Log Number":"US-05312009-0020","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Summary":"White blimp like and red diamond that fluttered.","Date of the Event":"05/31/2009 06:18 UTC","Longitude":"-112.178057","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17276.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17276.html"]}
