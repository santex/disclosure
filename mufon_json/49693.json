{"Case Number":"49693","divs":["Sighting DetailsAfter giving case to the sighting at my friends I couldnt see it driving, but I could see the glow lighting up the tops of the trees. I was stopped at the top on Seeley rd. That scared me so I drove home. I got home about 10- 10:30pm I was on the phone with my mother who was the only one I knew who would pick up when a light came down the same one I was following, and flew right over head. I felt like it knew I was there, and I was scared I wasnt sure if I should go inside or get in the truck and drive away. Instead I stayed on the phone, and watched it. It was soo close and bright when it was right over head, but it kept going so I calmed down. Going south due north first. I hung up, and went inside to look for my tripod. I set it up in the yard and at 11:00pm or so it came back this time East to West. I took a photo first then switched it to video and shot almost 2 minutes of video. This might be weird, but I sorta asked it to come back... like kinda prayer, or meditation I'm not sure, but I know somehow I am connected to this."],"Log Number":"US-08102013-0032","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Cadillac","There was one other sighting in Cadillac on or around August 9th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"44.28549","City":"Cadillac","Date Submitted":"08/10/2013 08:38 UTC","Summary":"UFO flies over head flares up then comes back got it on video.","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-85.350722","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.28549,+-85.350722(49693)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49693) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49693.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49693.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"08/09/2013 11:17 UTC","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
