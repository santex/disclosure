I'm 41 and stable. Last week I was outside, in the hot tub at the pool of my apartment, at about 9:30-9:45pm. I was relaxing and watching the sky and I saw a light in the sky about 2 fingers width s.w. of the moon. It was moving faster than an airplane but steady and moving \"up\". I was watching it and it wondering if it was an airplane up that high. Suddenly, it changed direction and was headed back the way it came and then, just shot out of view completely. I came back into the house and told my daughter that I thought I'd just seen a UFO. After seeing the ufo picture on coast to coast, I thought I'd just write in and tell what I saw. I don't know anything about astronomy."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06222006-0003","Region":"Texas","Summary":"light in the sky, moving in an unusual way","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Irving","There were no other sightings in Irving on or around June 15th 2006"],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.817308,+-96.944444(4973)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4973) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/15/2006 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown"}
