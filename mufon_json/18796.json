THE FIREBALL APPEARED TO BE DRIPPING LIQUID FIRE. THE FIREBALL SEEMED TO MOVE SOUTHWARD WITH ME FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THEN SLOWLY DECENDED BACK DOWN BEHIND THE HUGE MOUNTAIN TOP. I HEARD ABOUT A WEEK LATER THAT PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THE LARGE FIREBALL AROUND THE AREA 51 BASE, AND THAT IT MIGHT BE USED TO DEFLECT HEAD SEEKING MISSILES IF THEY WERE LAUNCHED TOWARD THE AIR FORCES BASE NEAR LAS VEGAS, BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.
