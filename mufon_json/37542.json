It drew my attention and I saw that it was a passenger jet heading toward the Atlanta airport but approaching on a different flight path than what is the norm. Then I saw directly behind the jet a much smaller craft with no contrail that was keeping up with the jet and following right behind the jet (about two inches from my viewpoint). There were no distinct features of the smaller craft except that it appeared to be silver and oval shaped with a light blue light shining from the front of the craft. It was obviously not a small jet or prop plane. I called out to my husband to look, but he saw only the jet plane and when I said, \"no, look at what is following it\", it was too late as both had passed our field of vision. It definitely gave me an odd feeling as I'd not seen anything like it before and was very disappointed that my husband did not also see it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37542.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37542.html"],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"34.21288","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-84.135163","Tags":"City","Region":"Georgia","Date Submitted":"04/17/2012 12:13 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04172012-0011","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.21288,+-84.135163(37542)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37542) map </A>","City":"Cumming","Case Number":"37542","Object Shape":"Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
