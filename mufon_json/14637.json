{"Summary":"Flat rectangular silver craft.","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn the middle of November of 2008 at approximately noon, I was walking on a country road near my residence when I observed a rectangular, silver craft the size of a single-engine Cessna flying west to east at an altitude of less than 500 feet. It moved slowly, not maneuvering, and at first I thought it was a small private jet. Then I observed that the craft had no contrail behind it and made no noise whatsoever. I watched the craft for ten minutes until it flew out of my range of vision. This is the third time a UFO has flown at low altitude within a quarter of a mile of my residence."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-86.811952","Region":"Indiana","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bainbridge","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.761157,+-86.811952(14637)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14637) map </A>","Latitude":"39.761157","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"14637","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14637.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14637.html"],"Log Number":"US-12312008-0008","City":"Bainbridge","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/15/2008 01:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"11/15/2008 01:00 UTC","Country":"United States"}
