This is the original. I ran it though a photo editing program and looked at it as a negative and sharpened it to try to get a clearer view of it, but I am still unsure what it might be. I did not notice anything while taking the picture and only came across it while sorting through it and many other pictures. There are other pictures of that area from differnet angles but none have anything like it in them."],"trends":["There have been 50 other sightings in Knoxville","There were no other sightings in Knoxville on or around September 12th 2012"],"Summary":"photograph of UFO ?...","Longitude":"-83.912139","Log Number":"US-11192012-0016","Object Features":"Unknown"}
