I and my partner had been in Mexico for about three months, and we had been in the Yucatan since Christmas 1973. Travelling with us were a friend of mine from high school and a fellow we���d met on the train from Montreal to Vancouver. We���d asked him if he wanted to come with us to Mexico, because we were going to buy a beater in San Francisco and drive across Mexico, and we needed someone who could fix a car ��� often. We had rented a place in Chelem (between Progreso and Chuburna Puerta) for one month, and then we met a young Canadian couple whose (names I remember as Jerry and Cathy) told us that nearby Chuburna was a much cleaner, pleasanter place, and there were places to rent with bathrooms and cement ceilings (a plus if you don���t want scorpions dropping randomly from above onto you as you���re lying in your hamaca). Around this time, we were watching for Comet Kahoutek (which I did see, faintly, once). Jerry and Cathy told us about a strange light they had seen recently several times at night looking toward the horizon across the gulf. It was a small, white, roundish-oval-shaped light that moved straight along the distant horizon and then vanished. One night around 3 am or so, we all went down to the beach (just a few steps away) and stood on the outside veranda of a concrete villa, someone���s empty summer home. After a while Cathy pointed out to the gulf, towards the right end of the horizon, just above the ocean. There was the light they had seen before, and it was moving, not at a breakneck speed but steadily left across our field of vision. When it reached a point where it was in a straight line ahead of us, it made a 90-degree turn and became steadily larger ��� it was a making a beeline toward us. Within less than five minutes, this light was hovering above the beach slightly to our right, about 30 feet away, maybe 20 to 30 feet up from the ground. We were looking up at it perhaps at a 45-degree angle. It was very silent, but we could detect a faint, low steady hum quite unlike the sound of an airplane or helicopter. There were no discernible features to be seen, just a giant glowing-whitish egg shape hovering there. We felt sure something in there must have been checking us out ��� why else would they have come over here? We were absolutely aghast, blown away and disbelieving all at once. Some one said ���should we try communicating with them?��� Nobody did (out loud, anyway). I remember feeling very nervous and incredibly curious for maybe four or five minutes as we continued to stare in trepidation at this ���. object. Then it hovered slowly up and wafted over the palm trees of Chuburna, away from the ocean. The sky was just starting to lighten, and the object vanished from sight. I had never seen anything like this before and have never seen anything like it since. But I have never forgotten it, even though 33 years have passed."],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
