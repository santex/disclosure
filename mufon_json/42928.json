Then they strategically lined up three orb like lights as if they knew I was watching. Whatever theae lights were very intellegent. So on my way back home I started to take pictures and they started to follow me towards my home. My fiance seen me about two blocks from home taking, pictures and witnessed the lights aswell they would go away in the instant he came to the corner then can back they were lining up parallel and like a triangle. I was fixated as to why the ufos were following me. I knew right away they were ufos!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
