{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI woke up feeling slighty scared. I looked toward my open bedroom door and a human like figure stood in the doorway. It was as tall as the door and thin. I tried to wake up my girlfriend but she didn't move. It then came at me. The next thing I remember is waking up in bed in the morning with a cold sweat and some bruises which I think I got from fighting back. I was taken a few times when I was a child but my mother says I was dreaming yet I was wide awake. I know I'm not crazy and scared it might happen again. Sometimes I wake up in the morning with bruises that I did not have when I went to bed and family and my girlfriend have noticed the bruises."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.97225","Case Number":"50239","Log Number":"US-08282013-0018","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.97225,+-85.661586(50239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50239) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50239.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50239.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other","City":"Grand Rapids","Date of the Event":"06/01/2013 02:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"It came into my room and took me","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/28/2013 06:56 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were no other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around June 1st 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.661586","Object Shape":"Other"}
