We were traveling north on Indiana State Hwy 31 at around 11:30 pm, and we were admiring the clear night sky. The moon was to the south-east of us; what I was assuming was jupiter was to our left; and appearing suddenly in front of us on the horizon was what I thought an unusually bright star or planet. We talked about it for a couple minutes or so. It was easy to constantly observe while driving because it was a stationary object in front of us, above the trees on the left side of the road. As we were looking at it and discussing whether or not it was Venus, the light just turned off. It looked as though an eyelid was closing over the light. We were totally shocked. It never reappeared. As we drove further ahead we saw no towers, nor did we see or hear any helicopters in the air. I'm curious if anyone else saw anything that night in Northern Indiana...
