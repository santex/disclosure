It then took a pretty sharp turn and continued but slower to leave. We did not get a close look at it but we are positive it was not a plane. It had no blinking lights but rather a ball of fire look. My step dad was called out front but by that time it had changed direction and he said \"it's just a plane\". Our feelings were we both had never seen anything like it before and just knew it was not a plane."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50070.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50070.html"]}
