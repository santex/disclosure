I took pictures of the sky with a 2 megapixel cellphone camera of the sky while driving to see what kind of pictures would come out since i had not used the camera yet. There are many \"orbs\" and what appears to be black helicopters in the pictures. None were visible at the time nor did I hear any sounds. I have taken many pictures showing these objects in this area over the last couple years these maybe the best and most recent. I have had good results using other cameras also. It seems I get something in this streach of road most of the time. I have others but here is two pictures."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21053.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21053_submitter_file1__015marked.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21053_submitter_file2__018marked.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21053_submitter_file3__019marked.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21053.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/19/2009 12:12 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-121.892766","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"08/07/2009 12:00 UTC"}
