As it gained altitude, it seemed to waver back and forth, rather than climbing in a straight line like a passenger or freight airplane. It flew towards me and over my head, and as it did so, I saw the three lights pulsing on and off, similarly to the way a mac computer light pulses. As it came over the top of me I could see it more closely, as it was only about 500 feet above me. It was the shape of a large cross. It was similar to an old style celtic cross, with the cross bar directly in the center. After that it disappeared from sight behinds the mountains."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.237667","Case Number":"9387","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.237667,+-74.194453(9387)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9387) map </A>","Summary":"Light colored cross-shaped with three pulsing orangish lights in a triangle on the underside","Date of the Event":"01/28/2008 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02012008-0006","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
