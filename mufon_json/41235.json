The object appeared East by Northeast of my location at about 60 degrees. The object was so bright that my mind constructed it to be a flaming 747 crashing into the high woods above the river valley. I waited for the sound and flash of explosion as it disappeared behind hills. There was no sound. The event lasted about two seconds. This is my first time on this website and I noticed the Frenchtown, NJ post."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Point Pleasant","Date of the Event":"12/25/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Summary":"Startled by large fireball bright object rapidly descending into the woods on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River.","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.422604,+-75.066282(41235)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41235) map </A>","Longitude":"-75.066282","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41235.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41235.html"]}
