My wife and I were on our way home from Rochester. 2. We saw a very bright light that was above the cascade river valley. We stopped at the golf course club house and watched the object hovering up the valley from us somewhere from a half to to a mile away. 3. We thought the it was a star or planet until we got closer. 4. It just sat there and blinked its lights. 5. We just tried to process what this could be with no sound or motion. I took the wife home and I went back with the field glasses 10X, They showed that the item would tip occasionally. and the lights would come on and off. 6. I then went toward Byron on the road to try and get to a crossing with it. It started to move and I was not able to intercept it. It just glided of at a constant altitude and velocity-- last seen going west."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Rochester","There were no other sightings in Rochester on or around December 18th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.014488,+-92.532999(35139)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35139) map </A>","Longitude":"-92.532999","City":"Rochester","Region":"Minnesota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35139.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35139.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"35139"}
