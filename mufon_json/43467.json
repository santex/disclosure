My friend saw it first and told me to look. I saw about 18 tear-shaped objects in a bunch with space in between. They were shiny and silvery. The skinny point was forward. They moved from North to South over the school. Then they turned East, formed a spiral, then a line where they all pointed East. Then they went over the school and I couldn���t see them. When I walked North to get another look at them, they were gone. The whole sighting lasted about a minute and thirty seconds. At first I thought they were birds, but then I saw the tear shape. I felt confused at first and wondered what they were. Then I talked to my teacher and he said that I was right about how they couldn���t be birds. Then I said they couldn���t be planes either because they were too small. At school we didn���t talk about it more, but I kept remembering what I saw. Now I feel normal about it."],"Longitude":"-109.066903","Log Number":"US-10222012-0014","Date of the Event":"10/17/2012 12:20 UTC","City":"Fort Defiance","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43467.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43467.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Other","Summary":"formation was a bunch, then spiral, then a straight line","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"43467","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None"}
