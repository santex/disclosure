I told my Wife to look but she couldn't see it. I had looked away to tell her to look more carefully, but when i looked back I couldn't see it anymore. I think I might have been seeing things, but I figure it's worth reporting. I've attached a picture of what I remember seeing."],"trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Birmingham","There were no other sightings in Birmingham on or around May 22nd 2011"],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
