There were multiple V shapes which performed this way at various starting and ending points in the sky. At the highly of this display there were at least three or four shapes performing this consistently. The entire anomaly took about 10 minutes to complete. I was 10 years old at the time, the youngest person to witness the event. Several adults also witnessed this event with one still living. Other adolescents can also verify my account. After all these years I wanted to offer this first hand account for review and recording."]}
