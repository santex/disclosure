{"Longitude":"-112.033964","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/24/2007 02:15 UTC","Case Number":"7317","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsEarly Sunday morning, I was outside my house having a cigarette and just looking at the stars. I was looking at the little dipper when I saw a light appear, it started as a dim star where I could not see one before, and grew larger and brighter, it got to be about the same size as Saturn appears here at night, but not as bright, and quite round. It then just disappeared. It never moved and lasted only about a second. I continued to watch the spot and the surrounding area to see if it was a plane, but I didn't see anything else. I never thought it was a UFO, it appeared to me to be more like a meteor that was coming straight at me because there was no movement, or an explosion like a super nova because it appeared to be at a great distance. I thought I would write to you because I don't know where to research such things and if it was an event like a super nova, I sure would like to know. Any help you can give me to explain this would be greatly appreciated, Thank You for your time."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.491651,+-112.033964(7317)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7317) map </A>","Region":"Idaho","Log Number":"US-06262007-0001","Summary":"Saw a flash of light near the little dipper","City":"Idaho Falls","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7317.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7317.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/24/2007 02:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"43.491651","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Idaho Falls","There were no other sightings in Idaho Falls on or around June 24th 2007"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unknown"}
