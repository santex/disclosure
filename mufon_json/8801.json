(which we could not) basically just a bright far light from where we were. think though; at the distance this was at, and the ability to go 90 degrees in the short time elapsed, means this object at it's height of travel, had to travel likely several thousand miles to achieve the angled trajectory of 90 degree radial travel in the time\\distance covered at the height observed. it would take quite a craft to achieve this. i would guess anyone with this level of technology, has the ability to control their phase relationship to eath's gravitational force and \"simply\" manipulate the phase angle and field effects to their own advantage for omnidirectional propulsion purposes. this would also explain the craft \"silence\" many seem to indicate in their respective sightings. i've never been much into scoping out any ufo possibilities, but also have no reason not to assume they are not only real, but far advanced compared to to our meager low tech existance. it would stand to reason. unless some are so indignant they believe themselves to own the universe? hardly i'd guess. our experience was the most unusual physics event i've ever witnessed personally. i don't convince easily either. had i not witnessed this myself, i simply would hold out room for another explanation. certainly not what i\\we witnessed!! dan"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"8801","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-93.58132","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8801.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8801.html"]}
