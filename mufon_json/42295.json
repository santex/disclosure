Suddenly my cousin said, startled, \"what the heck is that?!?!\" We all saw a reddish-orange light in the sky. It was a round-ovalish shaped object. Looked like the size of a golfball, in the sky. It slowly descended straight down at a constant rate. We were completely unsure of what it was, and a little shaken. It was nothing any of us have ever seen in the night sky. I videoed it until it went behind the horizon of tree tops. It looked large enough to have been fairly close, so we went for a ride to see if it could have landed in a nearby field (as our area is all fields and farmland) but we couldn't find anything. Our other friend commented that about 30 minutes before that, she was on the phone, on the other side of the yard, and noticed a much smaller white light (more like a large star) in the same area, that did the same thing (slowly descended straight down) ! But she got distracted with her phone call and forgot about it."],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.690357,+-73.56456(42295)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42295) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Sphere","Summary":"Reddish-orange light in the sky.
