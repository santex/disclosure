{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my back yard on a very clear night taking my dog out before bed. I was gazing at the stars when I just happened to notice this triangular shaped object flying very slowly at a VERY low altitude. I thought it was just an airplane but it had dimmed lights that outlined the shape of the craft. As it passed I didn't hear anything as you would with a typical aircraft. It couldn't have been no more than a couple thousand feet above me. I stood in awe, wondering what it could be. It kept a northerly direction as I lost sight of it over the trees to the north of my house."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Latitude":"37.2653","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/15/2011 11:00 UTC","Region":"Kansas","Summary":"Very low no more than maybe 3-5000ft. above me moving slowly in a northerly direction","Date Submitted":"03/14/2012 10:39 UTC","City":"Wellington","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.2653,+-97.371712(36459)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36459) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wellington","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-97.371712","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"36459","Log Number":"US-03142012-0008","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36459.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36459.html"]}
