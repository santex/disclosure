{"City":"Fort Collins","divs":["Sighting DetailsStanding in my back yard I was looking up at the sky at 10:30 PM. An incredibly bright streak appeared exactly where I was looking. At the front of the streak was a craft the shape of a shoebox but slightly wider. The front sloped down at a 45 degree angle and had a windshield on it. The craft was a dull grey that looked like what an F-15 jet is made of. It was flying at 3,000 - 5,000 feet to the best of my knowledge and traveling 1,000+ miles per hour. My best guess is it was directly over the ground 5 miles away. It was probably 50 feet long, 35 feet wide and 20 feet high. The trail of light appeared to be caused by the craft traveling through the air, not by the propulsion unit. After about 3 seconds the craft dimmed and the trail (a mile long behind it) died out. The craft made absolutely no sound which was shocking considering how fast it was traveling and relatively close to me."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.5933,+-105.079843(38764)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38764) map </A>","Summary":"Dull grey metallic, shoebox shaped ship leaving long bright trail","Case Number":"38764","Latitude":"40.5933","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Longitude":"-105.079843","Log Number":"US-06022012-0024","Date of the Event":"06/01/2012 10:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Fort Collins","There were no other sightings in Fort Collins on or around June 1st 2012"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Region":"Colorado","Object Features":"Window(s)","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Date Submitted":"06/02/2012 11:12 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38764.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38764.html"]}
