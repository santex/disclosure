We speculated and wrote it off as nothing much. At just past midnight, 3 more appeared and when they went behind the cloud cover, instead of being completely gone or diffused, they seemed cast a shadow that was round (cylindrical) on the cloud. They seemed to have a strange halo around them which changed direction every now an again."],"City":"Randburg"}
