Saw what looked like a shooting star off in the distance. As it got closer, it looked more like a meteor. It appeared to be heading straight in my direction and appeared to be getting very close. A moment later, I saw another one directly behind the first, following the same path. The orange-red glow was too bright to look at for very long. I could not make out any kind of shape. I went inside to get my phone to get a video, but when I came back out, they were gone."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.254477,+-122.435491(41410)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41410) map </A>","Summary":"Two large glowing red-orange orbs that looked like huge meteors","Log Number":"US-08042012-0011","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Washington","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41410.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41410.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41410.html"],"Case Number":"41410"}
