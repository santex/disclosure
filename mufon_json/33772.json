A giant orange sphere that kinda pulsated before it went out. I ran in the house to grab the camera but by the time I came back it had vanished. I Have seen UFO's before and I'm pretty sure that what I was viewing was not man made. From her side of the event. She was outside smoking when a Giant orange light streaked across at a downward angle with a jet like roar. At first she thought it was a meteor coming to kill us all until it stopped in its tracks starting to fade away. She then ran inside to grab me."],"Case Number":"33772","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33772.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33772.html"],"trends":["there have been no other sightings in lake elsinore \\ wildomar","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Summary":"Orange light streaks across then hovers in lake elsinore ca 12/1/2011","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date of the Event":"12/01/2011 08:30 UTC"}
