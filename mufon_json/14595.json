{"Date of the Event":"08/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"14595","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was watching the the stars from my deck on a typical beautiful Hawaiian night on the Big Island of Hawaii when I saw a shooting star cross the sky. I was looking up into the sky towards the East and the \"star\" flashed from north to south. Not a big deal................until it came to an instantaous stop and remained for more than 15 minutes. I did not blink for that 15 minutes, hoping it would move again and I didn't want to lose it, but it did not move again. My eyes began getting very dry and the object was not moving anymore, so I went back into the house."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14595.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14595.html"],"Latitude":"19.641706","Summary":"I was looking at the stars on a dark and starry night.","Log Number":"US-12292008-0008","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Kailua-Kona","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.641706,+-155.988236(14595)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14595) map </A>","Longitude":"-155.988236","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Hawaii","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Kailua-Kona","There were no other sightings in Kailua-Kona on or around August 31st 2008"]}
