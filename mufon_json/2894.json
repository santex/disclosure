I thought that it may have been ahelicopter spotlight, but it was very foggy and it was much lighter and adifferent color. It only followed at the same speed as my vehicle. I wasmostly amazed at what I was seeing. It was something that I had never seenbefore. It glowed a yellowish white color that illuminated the surroundings ofmy vehicle. I believe the fog also enhanced the effect. I then felt as if Ihad fallen asleep, but I was a few miles down the road from where I was anddriving a lot slower than before. When I looked at ocean to see the object, ithad dissappeared. I never told anyone until a couple of years ago. I neverfelt compelled to share my experience, but recently have had very strongthoughts about the experience. The other strange thing is a loss of time duringthe sighting. It seemed that I had been sleeping and had woken up 20 minuteslater. I know I did not fall asleep, but the time somehow went by. Hope thishelps.
