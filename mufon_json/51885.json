and, i did not want to sound like an idiot to anyone i could have called since 1) there was no explosion, and 2) no sirens immediately after the fact. my concern, my wonderings, my thoughts flooded my mind for at least an hour after that. i had pulled out my binocs but saw nothing in that direction immediately after-the-fact. even come daylight, i still saw nothing in that direction with binoculars. on an ending note, what i saw was not a meteorite (there was not that familiar streak in the sky associated with a meteorite)..... nope, this was a blinking red light (that which i associate with a police helicopter) that came angling down into the ucla area and suddenly disappeared at ground level. no other colored lights, no solid lights, no noise, no explosion. if *anyone else* saw the same thing that night.... please please make a report here! i saw something waaay back when in my late teens, and i will never forget what i saw then. then, 10 days ago i watched for over an hour and a half -- an object that never moved in the sky during daylight hours. and now, yet another 'something'. it took 30+ years to see 'something' a second time, and only 10 days later to see 'something' a third time.... waay to uncanny. i'd swear with a polygraph as to what i saw.... and still, even to this day, not a single report of a helicopter crash to confirm it. ten days ago, i had a witness to what i saw.... however, sadly this time.... it was just me.... and i'd give anything to know that someone else saw what i saw. i just cannot be alone in what i saw.... i am in the ucla westwood area and it being a late fri night\\early sat a.m. ---- well, there just had to be others who witnessed the same thing..... and as of today, sadly there just ain't a single other report listed here :("],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"10/27/2013 08:10 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.066745,+-118.446576(51885)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51885) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51885.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51885.html"]}
