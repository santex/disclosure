{"divs":["Sighting DetailsA few weeks ago i reported a UFOs that flew over my home at very low altitdue, well yesterday im sitting at home and the entire house started shaking from 2 black unmarked choppers, one was stationary over my home only as the other flew in a very tight circle over my home only. they stayed there for about 5 minutes then flew off. dont know what kind they where but they were to big not to be military. all black no markings at all, they were low enough to see 2 guys in the back not counting pilots. these things were huge and very very low and stayed directly over my home. looked through binoculers and was able to litteraly see inside....just kinda odd to have it happen after my sighting of 3 very low UFOs."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-80.052119","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.82671,+-80.052119(27047)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27047) map </A>","Latitude":"26.82671","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Black unmarked helicoptors","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27047.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27047.html"],"Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in North Palm Beach","There were no other sightings in North Palm Beach on or around December 18th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/19/2010 10:41 UTC","Case Number":"27047","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"12/18/2010 11:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","City":"North Palm Beach","Log Number":"US-12192010-0004","Source":"MUFON"}
