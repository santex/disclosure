everytime i would move it would move to maintain position directly overhead. if i moved faster it would keep up and if i moved slower it would slow down or stop when i did. it was always directly overhead. this continued for 30 minutes. when i remembered where my camera finally was and retreived it the craft had disappeared from my line of sight. my position was atop a small hill. i had about a 2 mile line of sight in all directions and could not see it. i was only out of sight with it for about 30 seconds. as a kid no one would have believed me and thought i was crazy so i never told anyone until my adult years. i don't think i've ever questioned our belief that we're the only sentient beings in the galaxy more than after that day. i've heard reports of smaller ufo's but this lead me to believe that humans are not the only ones who might send a small recon vehicle instead of a larger craft. this was way too small to have carried any substantial sized beings in it so i assumed it was a remote or autonomous vehicle. i was unnerved at first, but i felt i was in no immediate danger. after it seemed to mimic my every move it was kind of a game for a while. i seriously thought someone might be trying to play a joke on me and looked to a nearby treeline for a tether but saw nothing. i have made homemade hot air balloons and flown helium filled balloons before and this craft did not behave as a balloon would. i really had to convince myself that this was some type of craft i had no knowledge of, given the flight profile. i'm still baffled to this day as to what that object was. thanks for running this site. i realize that there's a lot of misidentification of aircraft and natural phenomina and it's easy to mistake a man-made or natural objects for a ufo. sorry, this was a perfectly clear day and my eyesight was better than perfect at that age. i've lived around military bases for a number of years and seen all types of military and civilian aircraft plus a few bomarc missile launches and there was no mistaking that this object was extremely out of place! i also worked for an ex-captain in the u.s. navy and after i told him what i saw he told me his story too. long story short=2 destroyer patrol sweep in the caribean during the cuban missile crisis. he was called up on deck around midnight to witness an extremely large, bright object traveling underneath the water directly in between the 2 destroyers(2 miles apart) at a high rate of speed. as it passed between them it erupted from the water at a shallow angle. there were about 100 men on deck on both ships who witnessed the huge, bright object angle from the water and flick out of sight in about 3 seconds into space. when his men asked if it was russian he replied \"it's not russian and it's not ours\". he dutifully filed a report and was asked not to pursue it by his commanders-understandibly. and he's an ivy league graduate with 2 degrees and served in the pentagon. he told me \"you're not crazy, i'm not crazy and i don't believe in church anymore!\" again, thanks for having the conviction to run an orginization that is investigating the possibility that there are more intelligent beings than ourselves. because the alternative is downright scary(and pathetic!) if we're the most advanced species in the universe...now that's laughable."],"Date of the Event":"07/11/1976 10:00 UTC","Summary":"4'-5' Disc shaped metallic craft hovered overhead for 30 minutes","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Windy","Longitude":"-80.088119","Region":"South Carolina","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Chesterfield","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"34.735989","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-09182008-0006","City":"Chesterfield","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
