The sky was clear but for a few Fluffy white clouds (Cumulus clouds) it was about 3:30 in the afternoon. I noticed the outline of a triangular shaped object. It was transparent you could see the sky through it. But the edges and the sky seen through the object were blurry and slightly darker then the rest of the sky. I watched as the object Rolled to were it grew very thin were you could hardly see it and then continued to roll and was seen the same as before. I watched as this object did this for about 1-2 mins. Then it rolled and was just gone!! That is when I heard my daughter Say ���DID YOU SEE THAT TWO!!!��� That is when I first realized she had stopped talking to and had been staring at the object to. I am not sure how far away the object was but it was about half way from the horizon to the noon position. So easily seen through the windshield. The size was the same width as the road when you would compare the road and the object."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"transparent triangular shaped object","Log Number":"US-06122012-0015","Date Submitted":"06/12/2012 04:08 UTC"}
