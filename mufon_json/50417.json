{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Details Near Columbia station in Lorain County, Ohio 8 or more people noticed a bright intense orange yellow light stationary at 15 deg elevation at exactly 10pm EDT, I asked several people what time their watches showed. It occurred on a Saturday in August, maybe the 17th. At an outdoor party while sitting around a very large bonfire out of the due east an orange intense light was noticed. I had consumed no intoxicants, alcohol or other, as my body reacts to alcohol causing joint pain. One lady said - look at that light, it is hovering there. We all watched same for about 1 - 2 minutes at which time it seemed to wink out in a short time. We all conversed about it's shape wondering what it was. It seemed that some observers thought something like a short line was was hanging from the bottom of the object. The expressed emotions were of wonder and puzzlement."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/17/2013 10:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.313107,+-81.946806(50417)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50417) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"50417","Tags":"City","Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Features":"None","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Columbia Station","There were no other sightings in Columbia Station on or around August 17th 2013"],"Latitude":"41.313107","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50417.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50417.html"],"Object Shape":"Cone","City":"Columbia Station","Summary":"very intense orange light in shape of point down cone. hovered, one jerky move then disappeared","Longitude":"-81.946806","Date Submitted":"09/04/2013 10:14 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-09042013-0007"}
