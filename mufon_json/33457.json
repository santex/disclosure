{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["sighting detailsgame camera on rural farmland caught three frames of an object moving from north to south descending. three frames over 39 seconds catches the light in three positions from upper right to left of center, flaring brightly on the final frame and well below the treeline. (note:the constant light on the center left is the light from a farmhouse about 3\\4 mile away) the final frame convinces me that this light is not from a aircraft due to it being below the treeline either landing or hovering very close to the ground. the next picture is taken (tripped again by deer) 30 minutes later and the light is gone."],"Tags":"City","City":"Otway","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33457.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33457_submitter_file1__PICT0132.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33457_submitter_file2__PICT0133.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33457_submitter_file3__PICT0134.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33457.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/18/2011 08:07 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.820763,+-83.227793(33457)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33457) map </A>","Region":"Ohio","Summary":"Strange light descending on game camera.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"33457","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/17/2011 07:12 UTC","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"38.820763","Longitude":"-83.227793","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Otway","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-11182011-0024","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"IFO"}
