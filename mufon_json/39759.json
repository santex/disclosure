At 10:50 pm on June 22, 2012, my wife and I watched the International Space Station pass overhead. This visible pass began at 10:50 pm, it rose in the SW at 10 degrees, peaked at 84 degrees overhead, and set in the SE at approx. 10:55pm (can't access info for the pass after it has occurred), darkening long before getting close to the horizon. We could see the \"cross\", as described in the previous report, which is either the solar panels or the side structures. I use the Heavens-Above website to watch for visible passes of the ISS and we will get another good one on June 25 at 9:45pm starting in the NW, peaking at 72 degrees in the SW, and setting at 9:51pm in the SE. I'm not a debunker or even a sceptic, as I have many previous UFO sightings. I just happen to be fairly certain I know what this one was. Thanks for the reports."],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"West Virginia"}
