She then looked and saw 4-5 fuzzy outlined objects that seemed to be orbiting each or pulsating in and out in reference to one another. These seemed to her to be moving in their orbit faster that any airplanes. They were just enough different than the background sky to be seen. She described them as being like a round cotton candy. They did not emit any light and were spherical in shape. Each object was the size of her fist at arm���s length and they orbited each other in an area of the sky she described as appearing like 10 - 1 on a clock face. She stayed outside for 20 minutes and observed the object until they seemed to dim as if they were moving away from her to the west. Her initial thought was that these were government craft. She was asked if the objects were searchlights and indicated that they were not and that there was nothing to her west that would have searchlights."],"Date of the Event":"11/24/2011 10:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33624.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33624.html"],"Summary":"Spherical Fuzzy Outlined Objects Orbiting each other","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Oxford","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Oxford","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"11/26/2011 08:22 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
