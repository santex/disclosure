I was the only one out of the group facing the ocean while everyone was turned away. all of the sudden, a bright neon green sphere flew out the clouds. at first i thought it was a shooting star but it kept going straight towards the ocean. i saw this \"ufo\" for about 6-7 seconds, then it crashed into the ocean and made a loud splash. then a huge wave crashed onto shore, following little ones shortly after. I freaked out because i thought a tsunami was about to occur, it was that dramatic. When i saw it crash, i ran in fear and my heart was racing. after i was excited and telling everyone i saw but no one witnessed the same thing. we packed our things and walked to the car and i asked people nearby if anyone saw what i saw but no one did. we then went to the pier to check if the water was glowing or if the ufo was visible, but it wasn't. I feel a bit crazy considering no one could agree with me or saw it themselves and just hoping im not the only one who witnessed this in balboa."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Newport","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"42287","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/03/2012 10:15 UTC"}
