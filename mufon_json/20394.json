It was pitch black and there were no lights on the country roads. As we drove through an open area, we saw a huge round object with colored lights to the right of the road. We thought it was probably some type of warning lights for aircraft. The lights were above the tree line. As were driving past the lights, the object started to move slowly over us and to the left of the car. There was no noise. All we could see was the huge circle with red, green and white lights. It was very dark outside and we couldn't see anything beyond the shape of the object. It moved slowly away from us - my friend wanted to stop. I wanted to get right out of there. I was freaked out and didn't care to find out where it was going."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"20394","Log Number":"US-11092009-0002","Summary":"Huge round object, with colored lights","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/17/1987 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Cortland","There were no other sightings in Cortland on or around August 17th 1987"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
