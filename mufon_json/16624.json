{"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","divs":["Sighting DetailsAttending an evening baseball game in downtown Norfolk, Virginia, USA, noticed a bright light in a partly cloudy daytime sky. Object was approximently to the WNW at about 30 degress elevation. Apparent position of object was above a distant thunderstorm in clear sky, but it was at an unknown distance so actual altitude and postion compared to clouds was not clear. No shape could be seen and the color remained white during the event. I initially thought it was glare off of an aircraft or the landing lights of one. What made it unusual was that there appeared to be little or no motion over the course of several minutes. It also appeared to change brightness several times in a slow pulsating way, which would be strange if it was a plane heading in a straight line or a plane making one turn - not to mention the lack of or little motion it exhibited as mentioned. After several pulsations, the object disappeared. I usually look up at the sky as an amateur astronomer and weather watcher, so for something to catch my eye like this object was unusual."],"trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Norfolk","There were no other sightings in Norfolk on or around April 21st 2009"],"Date of the Event":"04/21/2009 07:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.858399,+-76.277563(16624)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16624) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/21/2009 07:10 UTC","Longitude":"-76.277563","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16624.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16624.html"],"Object Shape":"Flash","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"36.858399","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Pulsating light in distance during daylight.","Region":"Virginia","Case Number":"16624","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-04222009-0008","Tags":"City","City":"Norfolk","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
