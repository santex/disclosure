I observed a large black square object that appeared to be between 200-500 ft in altitude traveling NW to SE. At first I thought there was a bright light on the bottom. When the sun set, I realized it was reflecting the setting sun on the bottom. After the sun set a few seconds later the object was completely black. There was enough light left to make it out. I could not judge the size but I would guess it was at least 20ft square or larger. It made no noise. There was no wind, if it was emitting any noise I'm sure I would have heard it. About a mile or so from my home it turned due south and seemed to be descending. I lost sight of it when it turned south due to obstructions of my view. I immediately checked news reports online and found nothing on it. I have never seen an object like it, nor any flying object I could not identify.....ever."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-110.763237","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-08212013-0014"}
