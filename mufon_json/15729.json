I noticed a bright object in the sky high up from the horizon. I was walking north and the object was in the northeastern sky. At first I thought to myself \"what is Jupiter doing over there?\" as I watched it got a little brighter then faded to a pinpoint in about 5 seconds. Could not tell if it was moving as I was walking. I was as bright as Jupiter..or Venus which was also visible in the western sky..about as large as Venus..a bright white that didn't change color, just slowly faded. I had first thought maybe I had witnessed a supernova...then I was waiting for all the lights to go out from a EMP..who knows I am reporting it here because I could find no other place to report it."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Large flash or fireball.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15729.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15729.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/25/2009 07:20 UTC","Case Number":"15729"}
