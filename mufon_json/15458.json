I would have taken a picture but I just moved into my apartment and could not locate my camera. Object was about 5-10 miles away Very bright a cloud past beneath it and you could still see it brightly. My wife came outside and witnessed it then became afraid and went back inside. I was making food on the outdoor patio I looked up and noticed it right away, there were stars in the sky to the east where the moon was and none very visible in the sky where the object hung. again this was not flare ot was a very bright none blinking or flickering object. I was most positive of what it was because low clouds past through it and it remained bright as can be . object moved horizantaliy (sp) back and forth then took off. again where i live the sky is very clear so I know waht I saw. contact me if you like. Last but not least I was in the Navy and use to study and search the sky at night and this is the first sighting I ever had and i swear by it."],"City":"Tampa"}
