It was too dark to see what was actually causing the trail, but it was far too wide to be from an airplane or other common aircraft. It was very straight and orange-ish with blue undertones. It \"ate itself up\" rather quickly, but we got to see it for almost a minute. I felt excited to see it because I am a firm believer in extraterrestrial visitors, but I had never seen anything with my own eyes."],"Log Number":"US-01312012-0007","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.6553,+-97.481269(35373)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35373) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Main Ave SW","Country":"United States","Latitude":"35.6553","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/31/2012 07:18 UTC","Summary":"Trail of very strange light"}
