When In front of me I saw a red light flashing with a white light next to it. I figure it was a slow moving plane. I would guess it was about 2000 feet up northeast from where I was driving, moving southwest towards south Lodi at about 200 mph per hour. As I was watching a green light came on that was not blinking on the other side of the object. As it got closer to my position I could see it was a black triangle shape object. I follow the craft for about 10 minutes until I lost sight of it."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"13783","Log Number":"US-11172008-0026","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13783.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13783_submitter_file1__objectshape.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13783_submitter_file2__PICT0006.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13783_submitter_file3__PICT0006contrast.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13783.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Lockeford","Latitude":"38.16993","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"11/17/2008 06:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Lockeford","There were no other sightings in Lockeford on or around November 17th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
