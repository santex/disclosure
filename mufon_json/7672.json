Curious, we when out and sat in our driveway watching the sky for meteors. After about 10 min. We spotted several meteors then we both noticed two small star like objects moving slowly toward each other, when they met they stopped moving for a few seconds then one of the objects seem to moved off in a 90 degree angle from its orignal path and the other one seemed to vanish. the objects were too high to be aircraft I thought maybe it was a satilight but after witnessing the strange pause and change in direction I discounted that idea. About three seconds after the first one vanished the second one seemed to vanish as well."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/12/2007 12:00 UTC"}
