The ufos are still hovering the sky until a large flash of light fills the sky and the crafts are gone. And when we woke up that next morning there were circle marks in the parks sand box with some weird rocks. Which were really warm and burnt our hands. We believe that it was element 115. We stored these rocks in a secret vault until we realized that they were mysteriously gone."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Shape":"Egg, Star-like","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Placentia","There were no other sightings in Placentia on or around July 9th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Placentia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47836.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47836.html"],"Summary":"Stayed in same spot for over an hour.
