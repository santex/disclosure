{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI looked out my front window of my house this morning at 5:15am PST. In the distance (guessing 15-20 miles) I noticed a strange object the size of a star to the West of Bremerton, WA. What caught my eye was the fact that it was giving off a pulsing light. \"That's no star!\" I said as I went to retrieve my binoculars. Through the binoculars I could see red , green, and blue lights rotating around it. I watched it for about 10 minutes, then decided to grab my video camera...but the battery was dead. So I just watched it through the binoculars for about 30 minutes total until some low level clouds obscured it. Then I went back to bed. It remained motionless the entire time. I know this because I had a reference point (electrical line over the street) in which to observe any movement for the 30 minutes that I saw it. No movement was observed!"],"Log Number":"US-12272009-0014","Summary":"Multi colored lights rotating around the craft","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Diamond, Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21190.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21190.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/27/2009 02:42 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.827222","Date of the Event":"12/27/2009 05:15 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Washington","Case Number":"21190","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.639722,+-122.827222(21190)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21190) map </A>","Latitude":"47.639722","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Seabeck","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","City":"Seabeck","Country":"United States"}
