{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn my way to work at 4:30 am. Standing in front of disneyland I noticed under the cloudcover a bright red pulsateing object. Moving slowy west and then making a horeshoe turn. The object than proceded to \"Shoot\" straight down a smaller red object. It than, still in full view under the cloud cover went out or just vanished. I was fully awake and aware when this occured. It was clearly not a conventional aircraft. It was fluid or plasma like, the object. I am on the bus filing this report on my way to work only an hour since the sighting. My feeling is being irritated. Sooner or later someone will have awnser for these sightings."],"Date of the Event":"01/16/2012 04:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"34890","Log Number":"US-01162012-0004","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"California","Longitude":"-117.915187","Summary":"On my way to work at 4:30 am.
