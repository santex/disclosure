I first saw this bright light late one night and thought it was a bright star, but as i watched it started to move, darting around the sky, zig-zagging and going in circles. It started out as just one but then recently i've been noticing more and more, I've counted 12 to 15. The weird thing is that they are out every night and usually in the same spot in the sky, moving with the night sky. They move around much too fast to be a satellite or anything that could be man made. I see them in groups of 3, forming a triangle, but i do not think they are physically connected because they all move independently from one another. There is one that is much brighter then all the rest, which was the first one that i spotted. I see these lights from sun down to sun up, or at least until i go to bed and they are there in the sky EVERY night."],"Latitude":"27.821145","Region":"Florida","Summary":"lights moving in the sky at night","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.468458","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26210.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26210.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10292010-0030","Date of the Event":"08/21/2010 08:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"10/29/2010 10:49 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Sebastian"}
