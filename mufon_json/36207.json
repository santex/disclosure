It was as bright as venus or jupiter looks in the night sky. In what feels like a moment , i notice the star than it moved real fast down, then backwards, then studdered twice up and disappeared. Totally dark as if it was never there. no sounds were heard. no residue seen. just gone. this bright thing just gone. I just sat there wondering what i just saw. it happened so fast. my mind obviously started of thinking of things it could be- airplane, shooting star(metorite), weather balloon (lol) but it could not be any of these. i see planes flares metor showers- this was different and unexplainable. i am filling this out because i hope i am not the only one who saw this."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
