{"Case Number":"25090","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had woken from my sleep, around 3:30 a.m. , and I noticed a very bright light shining through my window blinds. I got up to look to see what it was; upon moving a window blind, i saw a extremely bright light and heard a VERY loud screeching noise. I had then blacked out, and hadn't recalled the phenomina till recently. Since then I have heard random loud screeching noises, but haven't seen the bright light since. Unexplainably, I noticed that there was a mark and or marks, that were scarlike on my back. One was a big circle, the other two smaller, but unexplainable, unlike my other marks (moles) on my back. The clock I had set that night (with fresh batteries, since I had recently moved to a new address) had lost 6 hours that night. I have only hinted at what has ACTUALLY happened to my family, as not to scare them. I wish to remain anonymous, because I believe I have been abducted by something; whether alien or human.
