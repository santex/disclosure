I went outside around the indicated time facing south. Once outside, I heard a sound that I can only describe as a deep humming that had a rhythmic quality to it. This did not sound like an airplane or a helicopter. I then noticed a craft which appeared to be hovering over, what I would guess, was near Merrimack Valley High School. I noticed the craft seemed to be spotlighting on the ground below. I initially thought it to be a helicopter until my mind registered what I was really seeing and hearing. This craft then very slowly moved toward the east. I noticed the craft was equilaterally triangular in shape, with orange lights in the corner of each point. The beam of light I had seen was emitting from its center. As the craft moved to the left of where it had been, from my vantage point, the beam of light cut out and became a bright red pulsating light, larger in size than the orange lights on the points. At this time, I knew what I was witnessing was technology I have not known humans to be capable of producing. My heart raced, but I continued to watch intently in amazement. The orange lights moved in a circular motion, as if very slowly rotating as it moved to the left. I noticed to the left of this craft, was what appeared to be another. This one was much less prominent and detailed than the first. I could clearly make out the shape and the defined individual lights on the first craft, while the second one appeared to be one orange star-like light. I attempted to take a picture of these two craft with my 1.3 megapixel cell phone camera, but only resulted in a picture of a white dot. These two craft continued their path to the left remaining exactly the same distance from each other and at exactly the same rate of speed. They moved as a perfect pair. I watched them continue their path to the east until they were over, what I would guess to be the Merrimack River or I-93 when they suddenly changed direction to the north. It was a rapid change of direction. Not a perfect 90 degree turn with a point, but a 90 degree turn with a slight curve when made; much faster than I���ve ever known an airplane or helicopter to make alone, let alone two to do perfectly synchronized. I watched the craft fly off to the north until they were beyond the one-story roofline of the building I had exited before witnessing these craft."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Concord","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change"}
