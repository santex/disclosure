While driving to one of the locations we were stopped at a stop sign by a local thrift store which you can see the sign of it in the video. My cousin was driving and I was the passenger he placed the car in park and we both watched these three yellowish white lights in a triangle shape formation. They were revolving and then flattened out into a straight line formation and then appeared to get closer to us. My cousin began taping as we both watched and talked in excitement not knowing what it was. I just remeber being overly excited trying to focus in on it. As we watched one of the lights in the formation went off on its on path and dissapeared and then as we looked for it just apppeared again seconds later. It appeared back in the line formation and then all three seemed to get closer again and then came together as they got smaller and began traveling at a high rate of speed in which i took the camera and we got back in my cousins truck and we tried to follow but lost it. Video and sound was recorded of the hole experience. I have sinced witnessed the same lights but did not have a camera to record and it was not of the same magnitude. Upon someone requesting I would submit the video but I do not have the capablity to transfer the video over to a computer file. Video is on vhs recorder tape. If anyone else has seen anything like this please let me know or let me know if anyone can debunk and explain this event. Thank you."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Triangle, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.110408,+-84.50747(22921)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22921) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ohio","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Summary":"three lights or objects in a revolving formation","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04212010-0005","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22921.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22921.html"]}
