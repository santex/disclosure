I took these 3 photos. The first, nothing unusual. The second, an object that I thought was a dragonfly. I saw it in the camera but when I lowered the camera a second later it was gone. Took the third shot, nothing there. To my knowledge it was just there a second, I did not see it move, did not hear anything. It was just there, then it was gone. It happened so fast I didn't have time to have feelings. But as soon as I saw it and took a second picture I ran in the house to see the photos on my computer."],"Region":"Rhode Island","Latitude":"41.640804"}
