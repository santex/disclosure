The lights were low engough in the sky to not be a celestrial body. I came outside and then saw these three(3) lights which ran vertical to the treeline behind our home. This treeline in the middle of a cornfield and before it is our orchard. This is a rural area where there are no street lights and not many homes. After looking at this body of lights with the binoculars I realized at each end of this body was one additional light. These lights moved ever so slightly with out a sound. We didn't notice the movement until we left to warm up inside and came back outside to find the lights were not quite in the same position."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21033.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21033.html"]}
