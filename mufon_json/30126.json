{"Case Number":"30126","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-78.650874","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was laying in bed watching T.V. and I heard a noise that I thought was a jet getting ready to pass over my home. I made the statement \"jets at this time of night?\" and waited for them to get louder. The noise never got louder it stopped. I looked towards my window and saw lights coming through the shade. I was curious as to what it was so I pulled back the shade. I saw a triangular UFO one clear light at each tip perfectly spaced from each other with a large red light in the middle. The lights were very bright. The object traveled very slowly and stopped to hover for a around 30 secs. above my neighbors home. I jumped up to run to the door to go outside to get a better look but by the time I got there it was gone.It appeared to be so low that I actually woke my husband up because I thought the object was going to crash. As I was looking at the object through the window I could not hear any noise. There seemed to be no disruption of the trees around the object and my dogs weren't barking at it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07112011-0015","Date of the Event":"07/07/2011 01:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.441073,+-78.650874(30126)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30126) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30126.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30126.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Triangular shaped object in sky outside my window.","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Virginia","Latitude":"37.441073","Date Submitted":"07/11/2011 06:58 UTC","trends":[],"Country":"United States"}
