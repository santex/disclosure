I have seen them about a week prior to this sighting(June 24th or 25th) they were stationary the first time,a bright light caught my attention I turned my head to see the light and there were the two \"stars\",before I could react they faded away,kind of like watching a light bulb slowly dim out and they did it at the same time. Lasted maybe a minute. Last night they moved across the sky together close to the same spot they were last seen a week before that. They didnt stay long enough for me to get pictures either time:("]}
