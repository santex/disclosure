I was able to zoom in all the way to the left of the sun, because I saw an object in the clouds. I viewed this in negative color as well and it showed up as if it was a hot object. I didn't know what I caught till I uploaded my digital pictures the next day.

I'm not sure what this object is, but maybe somebody could look at it. I have more pictures from that day, but couldnt see anything else, and havent checked all of them.
