On this night it was clear with no clouds. As I looked up, on this night, I noticed a nonflashing light flying right above my home. The light was not high enough to be a plane and what I thought was stranger yet was that it made no noise as it passed over my home. Right after it passed over my home I took a picture using my cell phone. In the photo I sent with this report might seem to be a pic of nothing but black sky but I ask you to please use your computer to in large the pic and focus on the light. When you inlarge the pic you will see a strange looking object. After the object flew East for about 5 min. the light just shut off. It might be nothing but hope this might help in someway"],"Date Submitted":"05/23/2009 09:22 UTC","City":"Salem","Log Number":"US-05242009-0024","Summary":"Non flashing night light.","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Salem","There were no other sightings in Salem on or around May 23rd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.943968,+-123.028356(17124)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17124) map </A>"}
