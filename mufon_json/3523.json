The object hovered about 100 feet from the ground and 300 feet from the mountainside. The object moved slowly in a counterclockwise spin. The lights illuminated the ground and mountainside in periodical intervals. 5) Both my friend and I were on our cell phones as we started to view the object. Our initial reaction was telling the people on the phone that there is some type of military activity and commenting about the illumination of the object. As we drove closer the object was too large to be a military helicopter or search and rescue vehicle. We then commented that it may be a balloon similar to the military balloon on US95 at the Yuma Proving Ground. As we debated, we started to notice that the object had three sides. The object was all black and was unreflective with absolutely no noise. We came about ��� of a mile southeast from the object as we continued north on SR78. At the closes point we could see the object from the reflective illumination from its lights and it was moving in a slow counterclockwise spin. Our reaction at that time was that we were seeing an unidentified flying object and we started to tell the people on the phone while we were slowing down to get a better view. As we slowed down to stop on the side of the road our cell phones all turned off at the same time. Not loss of cell signal or service and not dead batteries or turning them off, the two phones just turned off. We then were fearful of the object and started to drive off. 6) We lost sight of the object as we drove off the object���s lights started to dim and in one big flash of light the object was not there or at least not visible to us. Note, that the flash of light was not blinding just radiant enough to conceal the object. The light through this whole sighting was not comparable to conventional lighting as I���ve seen from helicopters or other airplanes. The light had a soft glow but was very bright and the shadows of the trees and shrubs on the side of the mountain were not sharp but defused. It gave off light as a cold light stick would."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Glamis","There were no other sightings in Glamis on or around August 4th 2004"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"IFO"}
