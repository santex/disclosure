We did not here it at all. It was completely soundless...if flew over us at a speed somewhat faster than an airplane.. i would say it was no more than a quarter mile up from our heads and it appeared to be about as big as football field. I myself did not feel frightened by it but i was intrigued and wanted to see more..kind of hypnotizing..After it passed the trance i was in stopped and my friends and i all looked at each other and began to discuss enthusiastically what just happened and what we seen..we didnt come to any conclusions to what had just happened to us..but we all had agreed what it looked like and what it felt like."]}
