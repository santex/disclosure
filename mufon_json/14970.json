(Our kitchen window faces West). At first I thought it was an airplane, but soon realized it wasn't moving. It was a very, very bright. Unlike anything I have ever seen before. I thought maybe it was Venus, but as I was watching it (for a few minutes), it slowly faded out. After the light went out, I did notice what I believe is the planet Venus, lower on the horizon. Whatever I saw was higher up and appeared closer to my window. I should also note that I called my husband over and he saw it before it faded out as well. Would love to find out what it was!! There must be a logical explanation!"],"Case Number":"14970","Summary":"Bright oval shaped light in sky.","City":"Seattle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
