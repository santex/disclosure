{"Log Number":"US-11292012-0012","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving north on CO Ro 8 to St. Cloud to pick-up my daughter from daycare. I was watching the sky because I read in the paper that the Blue Angels were flying into town that day. Above the tree line in the direction of Hwy 10 I saw a hovering square object. It was dark and looked mechanical, reminded me of a transformer type object (weird comparison, but true). I watch the object hover for about 4 minutes and then it disappeared as I drove behind a small group of trees. This was 100% not an airplane, helicopter or any other flying vehicle that I have seen. Since it was in broad daylight and I am sure other people saw this too. If you did, please comment."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in St Cloud","There were no other sightings in St Cloud on or around November 14th 2012"],"City":"St Cloud","Date of the Event":"11/14/2012 04:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-94.16324","Latitude":"45.557945","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44228.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44228.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.557945,+-94.16324(44228)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44228) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Minnesota","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"44228","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"11/29/2012 03:13 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"Dark object hovering over Highway 10 around 4:30 PM"}
