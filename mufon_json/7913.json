Tonight they were filling the sky with dozens of strobes--placed too close together to be aircraft and far apart enough to signify something large, judging by their distance. Every once in awhile, maybe 20 minutes or so, one would go from being a strobe, to a bright star which would hover or navigate around. These bright stars would then \"bloom\", as I have read in other accounts, into a bright flare which lasts a few seconds (5-10) On this night there was a flare that started at the top, then as soon as it went out another came on immediately below it and to the left, and then another below and to the left and another and another. All together there were four that progressed down in a fairly evenly timed and spaced sequence in a diagonal line. Video of decent quality was made of the event and I am working on editing it down."],"Latitude":"38.132448","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7913.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7913.html"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"7913","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.132448,+-87.9305(7913)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7913) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/12/2007 08:30 UTC","Longitude":"-87.9305","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Log Number":"US-09142007-0006","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in New Harmony","There was one other sighting in New Harmony on or around September 12th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"Same type of sighting as described on 9/11/07, lots of twinkling strobes, sometimes turning into folden orange fiery orbs.","Date Submitted":"09/12/2007 08:30 UTC"}
