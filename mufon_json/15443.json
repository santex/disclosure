{"Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"Bright light hovering over Boulder and then slowly descending over foothills.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving West on Highway 36 into Boulder, Colorado and I noticed a bright white light hovering above the city. It appeared to have multiple lights clustered together as a single unit (large light on top and two smaller lights on bottom). I thought that it looked strange and it didn't have blinking lights and was larger than a helicopter would have been at my distance (approx a couple miles). The object appeared hazy. It hovered in the same spot for about 4 minutes, and then slowly moved down towards the foothills. I called my wife to tell her to look out of our back door to see if she could see it, but it was already out of her line of sight. I couldn���t tell whether or not the light actually went behind or in front of the flatirons before it finally went out of sight as I drove through town."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02112009-0017","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/11/2009 08:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Longitude":"-105.266976","Source":"MUFON","City":"Boulder","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15443.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15443.html"],"Region":"Colorado","Object Features":"Dome","Case Number":"15443","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"02/11/2009 08:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Boulder","There were no other sightings in Boulder on or around February 11th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.023826,+-105.266976(15443)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15443) map </A>","Latitude":"40.023826","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
