and son, was sitting on my front portch, looking for meteorites, it was ten til midnight and my nephew and his wife and children went home, everyone went to bed but myself and 9 year old son. at midnight, my son said he was going to bed and went into the house. i sat there gazing at the stars, i noticed my neighbor was washing dishes at her kitchen window, her outside entrance light was on and her kitchen light. my light were all on inside my house also. all other neighbors lights were off. there was one lamp post light on across the street to the right. the woman doing dishes was to my left. between these two houses was a large yard with a garden planted. it belong to the neigbor on the left. down the street about a half a block i seen a fireball as big as the sun, yellow red orange fire turning clockwise, as the fire was turning counterclockwise. it went up into a arch as it crossed my street, when it reach tall trees i could not see it anymore. boy, i yelled at my son you just missed the biggest meteorite, you will ever see in your life. he yelled from the window from above the portch roof, mom i!m going to bed, it is gone now. i looked back at my neighbor doing dishes, as i did i heard a big bang like machinery breaking down. the sound and the flurecent aqua green floodlight hit the ground between the two houses across the street. filled up the intire yard, right up to the neighbors window. i was stunnd, and thought what is a helicopter doing here, but i heard no noise. next thing i notice was the street went dark the neighbors light went out in the kitchen and backdoor, the post lamp went off the transformer on the pole blew out for everyone on that side of the street. my electricty stay on. i stepped off the portch and look down the street to my left toward the intersection two doors down, there in the sky about 80 to 70 feet in the air was a hugh lighted porthole with a beam coming out. i was not surprised at all. i remember saying, why are you in town sucking up my neigbors corn, when this is the corn belt of america. they could of took any road out of town and found corn.. then i went into the street and walked toward the craft. i had to see inside it before it took off. it was really an amazing event,it just hung there over my head making not a sound. i did not look to see if my neighbor had come out of her house, i was so wrapped up into what i was seeing. the green floodlight came out to the right of the craft, which landed in the yard across the street. i told my self barney and betty was telling the truth. so don!t leave the street and you will not be in that beam. i knew from the corn, it could levitate. i guess i thought i was being smarter than they whoever they were. as i walked under it there was a circular room about 15 feet in diameter. and the wall was nothing but bright white light, so bright you could not see a structured wall. the light was the wall. as i turned and followed it with my eyes, i notice looking to the right side of a iron looking rim, i was looking through the green beam which was lighting up the under hang of the craft. just a small part, i even remember bending my knees think i may see it better, it was a dull grey but not smooth, it had rough bumps like knobs on it. i had seen enough, and was coming to my senses, i got to get in my house. i keep saying stay in the street every two steps i turned around to make sure the light had not moved, i was finally getting scared. about my third turn around, i was looking up the beam, so i looked down at my feet, i was in the neighbors yard near the corn, i can!t explain what i felt, but i ran across the street in three leaps, yelling at my son, who i thought may still be awake, it had only been five mins. he did not answer so i went and utterly drug him downstairs, to the living room window. the beam was still there, as he got in front of me to look out the floodlight went out. i remember saying, oh, they were only here for my eyes. he ran to the door as i looked at the clock time, it was 3:35 and wont never forgot that second in the 36 years since. i ran to the door, he said lets see it take off. i put my body against the door and would not let him out. at the same time i was pressing my hands into both sides my head, saying thank you god, for making them put me back. i had four children and the nine year old was my oldest. my husband never believed me. he said i must of seen the search light from the airport. it was no use. i called the radio talk show the next day and ask if anyone had seen any thing usual in the sky last night. the radio man laughed and ask if i had seen any little green men. i bang the phone down, and new i would never be able to tell anyone. i did tell friends and family. i had a headache the next day that went on for years 33to be exact. i could not walk straight and could not tell the doctors what happen. i light up lights a few times in my living room while dusting end talbles, i remember that. finaly in 2006 i went into an mri and it showed i have white lesions on the left side of my brain. it controls the right side of my brain. the doctors said that is why you fall to the right. well i never told them what i thought cause it only the year when it started, which is a half truth. there is nothing they can do for it. they also said they do not know why or how it got there. i know, and that is all that matters. no one would believe me if i told them. i do not have ms, which, i knew that also, as after all these years i would of gotten worse. white lesions sometimes means ms. i never approched the lady across the street as she would of thought me a loony, also i did not know her personally. i know she had to come outdoors as the green was in her window where she stood in the house darkness from power loss. maybe they had her too, but memory of the craft was wash out of her head. that part they let me remember. some say it was so too much trauma and i dont want to remember. maybe so. but i did have a dream about the craft 30 years later, i was inside the porthole turning looking at this wall of light, and it was like a florescent light but instead of bulbs, it was light flat slates of mirrors stuck together emitting this light. i could see the seam between the slates. but from the street, it looked be all one wall of light. i was so scared and told myself lois you have to wake up you cant go any farhter into this dream and i woke up, i did not sleep the rest of that night. i want to know and yet i dont. this is the truth the honest truth.
