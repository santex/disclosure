I saw and heard it from Norfolk. No clear explanation has ever been given (found) for this mysterious occurence. It was an extremely bright light that was stationary for a bit and then just flashed to the east. Once out of view a loud boom was heard across both cities. This was not a sonic boom from military jets. Some claimed it was a meteor, but there has been nothing found to prove this. I know what I saw. Please let me know if you have heard anything about this. Thank you. I was in bed watching tv when I was distracted by a bright light appearing out my window out of my peripheral vision. I did not know what it was, but it was the brightest thing I've ever seen in the sky at night (literally lit up the night sky). It stayed stationary for about 1-2 minutes and then just shot towards the east at an unbelievable rate of speed. Then 1-2 minutes later there was a loud boom that the entire region heard (made the news) with no good explanation. I could not believe my eyes or ears, but it was quite obvious it was not a meteor because it stood stationary for a good while."],"trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Norfolk","There were no other sightings in Norfolk on or around April 27th 2009"],"Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"09/02/2009 11:41 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19039.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19039.html"],"Summary":"Bright light then moving extremely fast out of sight and a very loud boom.","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
