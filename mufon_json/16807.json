At this time I saw a jet that looked like an F-16 fly unusually low from Vail towards Frisco, it then took a large turn northward around Buffalo Mountain and toward the Gore Range and I lost sight of it. Right after that I noticed a silver circular object that was hovering behind the southern side of Buffalo Mountain. I had been watching the sky that day and this object was much lower than any of the jets I had observed, besides the F-16. The whole event from the time I saw the F-16 to when the ufo left was around 30 seconds."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-106.09752","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/30/2009 03:30 UTC"}
