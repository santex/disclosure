I was in the passanger looking out the window and there were heli's flying in what seemed like big circles, my husband said sikorsky is near there and was why .. I looked at the sky out the front windshield as I always do .. and there was a huge shiny circle in the sky ..the sun was setting to the right of us .. and it reflected from the sun like metal .. then it just disappeared as I started to freak out and show my husband and it disappeared .. I was frantically looking everywhere and to the left it was lower and flying above but along side of us then it was gone .. looked out the back window it was there then gone .. Went to the house spent some time there, paid for the car ..left it there to come back for it .. and left to go home .. got lost on this backroad along the bay or a strip of water to the ocean .. and I saw two or three of them out over the water but they were glowing a white light and they were far out .. I made him stop at a restaurant and I tried to take a cell phone picture but it wasn't showing up .. He was mad we were lost .. back in the car back down the same long main road of a back road and the car died .. I was upset ..we were fighting I got out of the car and there was the biggest round glowing circle and I could hear and then see helicoptors flying along side it .. I was freaking out and he was trying to fix the car because it was very cold and wouldn't pay attention .. there was dogs barking and I turned around and back over the water there was upward of ten or more of the same circles in an down v shape over the water pointing toward where the one was creeping slow and silently above me .. I turned and ran up the street as far as I could go following this slow moving circle light ..really really big and low .. but just a solid white light .. circle .. and it went over the hill and was gone .. I turned around to look at the others .. and they were gone! ..I looked high and low and no one else has seen them .. and I haven't found any pictures that look the same .. Has anyone else reported this?! .. oh and the odd thing .. we went and bought a new battery when a ride came for us ..came back and put it in .. and that died .. we figured it must be the car .. because it was an rx7 that was modified .. his father tied a rope to the car (yes we were gonna attept to tow it somewhere) and about a mile out he pop started it and the new battery worked .. The next day changed back to the old battery and that one was fine .. there was nothing wrong with the car at all!"],"Date of the Event":"11/08/2008 04:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"4pm reflecting metal like light ..late night white light","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
