The ufo was approximatly one kilometer away from me and about one thousand feet up, there was no sound coming from it, and no somke trail behind it, the ufo speed was about 100 to 120 kilometer per hour so i got a good look at it, the approximate size of the ufo was about 100 feet across, the brightness of the ufo was the same as the planet venus which was also in the sky at the same time. My first reaction was cool another ufo that i've seen as this is the second time the i have seen an ufo outside my work place and the 10th ufo that i have seen in my life. After the ufo disappeared behind the hills to the east of work i felt realy good and happy that i seen another ufo."],"Latitude":"35.529263","Region":"Oklahoma","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/13/2009 07:02 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
