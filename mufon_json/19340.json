A huge triangle flew right over my head. It was not a air ship, b-1 or 2, fa-111. this thing made manuvers that is impossible for the human body to take with or without a pressure suit. It made a 235 degree turn so fast my eyes could barely keep up with it. Then stopped and went over slowly at the with of half the space of two telephone poles at maybe 500 ft above. No indication of any type of pulposion at all. Never seen anything like it ever. I really hope its ours because it was bad ass for sure."],"Case Number":"19340","Date Submitted":"09/16/2009 08:46 UTC","Log Number":"US-09162009-0004","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","City":"Kingman","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.197193,+-114.049106(19340)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19340) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19340.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19340.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/16/2009 05:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"huge triangle totaly silent right above my head","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other,Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Kingman","There were no other sightings in Kingman on or around September 16th 2009"],"Longitude":"-114.049106","Tags":"City"}
