I saw two stationaryobjects, exactly like stars except they were definitely too large to be stars. One was directly above the other separated by what would be 3-4 inches if I helda ruler up as a measure. You could tell they were like objects,three-dimensional and not that far away, very different from stars. They nevermoved, or twinkled. After staring at them for several minutes, I called myneighbor who watched them with me for 15 more minutes or so. We then returnedto our houses and didnt report it or tell anyone else."],"Longitude":"-118.400356","Latitude":"34.07362","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Beverly Hills","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"08/08/2002 06:43 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1802.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1802.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
