I thought it was a shooting star at first, but it had no tail. I've seen shooting stars before during meteor showers and this looked nothing like one. It stayed consistantly bright the whole 2 seconds that I saw it. It was just a single spherical white ball of light that was too fast to be a plane or helicopter, too bright and too big to be a satilite. It appeared out of no where. The sky was clear. It traveled in a straight path down towards the horizon then vanished. I had a strange mixture of fear and excitement overwhelm me as I continued driving. I was curious if anyone else might have reported it so I checked the MUFON live map. The closest sighting was the one in Redding,CA the same night(10-26-10)... 4 spherical white shapes only 45 min before my sighting. I thought this was an interesting coincidence."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.328415,+-122.868825(26135)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26135) map </A>","City":"Medford","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"26135","Log Number":"US-10272010-0007","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Going northbound on I-5 object appeared in NW sky.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26135.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26135.html"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Medford","There were no other sightings in Medford on or around October 26th 2010"],"Latitude":"42.328415"}
