I noticed a silver\"plane\" flying to the west but when I looked at it, there was no tail, and no wings although there did seem to be dark vertically rectangular areas in the middle near where wings would be. It was flying low, at a descent altitude for planes, but flying horizontally, also much slower than a plane would appear to be moving at that altitude. I was staring at it, trying to make out wings because I thought they had to be there. There was definitely nothing where the tail should be, we were looking at it from the side. I didn't say anything to my husband because I felt silly, but a few seconds after I noticed it he said \"What is that thing?\". Neither one of us had ever seen anything like it before. We watched it for a couple of minutes till it was small in the distance to the west. It was much too slender to be a blimp. I still think there must be some explanation that doesn't involve aliens but I sure can't think of one."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Wingless tail-less","Case Number":"29801","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/28/2011 09:00 UTC","Longitude":"-86.70945","Date Submitted":"07/29/2011 06:20 UTC","Region":"Indiana"}
