My daughter saw it and called my attention to it. We saw a very bright disc above the clouds going South East at a steady speed. We watched untill it disapeared behind clouds. Prior to losing sight of it, we saw it go behind and emerge from a small cloud. The course always remained the same. There was no contrail, or navigation lights. The normal flight path for aircraft here is East and West. This was brighter than any star. As bright as the moon on a clear night. The moon wasn't visible that night. Our home is approx. 400 feet from the Pa., Ohio State line."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
