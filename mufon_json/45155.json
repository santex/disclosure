It was in a downward diagonal angle. It switched lights from blue to green and orange. It freaked me out at first. Just that it changed colors like that, it was almost like a beacon. I tried to find it later, but could find no trace of it. Nasa hasn't said anything about a satallite or a shooting star.I lost sight of it when it went over tree cover."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Henrico","There were no other sightings in Henrico on or around January 10th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Shape":"Blimp, Bullet, Missile, Disc, Oval, Square, Rectagular, Star-like","Longitude":"-77.468063","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45155.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45155.html"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01112013-0015","Summary":"UFO on downward diagonal descent","Date Submitted":"01/11/2013 06:59 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.60875,+-77.468063(45155)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45155) map </A>","Case Number":"45155","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.60875","Source":"MUFON","City":"Henrico","Region":"Virginia"}
