(though mostly stationary) but absolutely moving unlike anything of our technology!!! and no, it is not a satellite, or space probe. we lack the jet propulsionary capabilities for maneuvers like that. view these photographs on photobucket @ www.photobucket.com\\ufotampa"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Is there such thing as bobbing \"star\"?
