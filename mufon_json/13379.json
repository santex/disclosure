girlfriend and i saw an unidentifiable light phenomenon in the sky. we were at the grape st. dog park in south park, san diego letting our dog run around. we were relaxing in the northwestern most area in the park sitting in the grass and noticed that there were several large hawks flying around eying the dogs in the park. we have a small dog and there were several other small dogs in the vicinity so i was watching the hawks fly around when i noticed what looked like a star in the sky north of where we were. i thought at first it may have been a plane or a helicopter coming in, but the object was stationary and appeared to be changing its orientation as it sat there. i have no better way to describe it than to say that it looked like it was \"flopping around\" or \"crawling\" in place and the sun reflecting off of it was illuminating different aspects of it (keep in mind it was very small and far away). the grape street dog park is almost directly east of downtown and the airport (which is on the bay on the west side of downtown) and airplanes do circle around and then approach the airport from the east, so we thought that maybe it was just an airplane or helicopter approaching us which would explain why it appeared to be stationary, but within a few minutes, a plane came in and it became apparent that this object was very very far away in comparison to the size of the planes coming in and the object was much higher and further away and in a different location than anything else we saw (and stationary). we noticed after a few moments that there were now two light objects. the original object was the larger of these two and the smaller one appeared to split off from the larger one and do a circle around it before stopping at about the 4 o'clock position in relation to the large object. both objects then moved very slowly across the sky until they were obscured from our line of sight by a tree and seemed to be a little smaller once they were visible as if they were moving away from us. once they emerged from behind the tree and were visible again, the smaller object had moved to about the 8 o'clock position in relation to the larger one and then disappeared completely after a few moments. just for clarification, this thing was really small and looked like a star and the movement that was discernible at first was not now apparent and we were left watching a point of light that was very difficult to refocus on if you looked away. the movement had ceased at this point for a few minutes and the object was stationary. after a few moments, the light was indiscernible and i thought it had vanished. i moved closer to the center of the park which was east from our original location and was once again able to locate the object. i watched and filmed this object for quite a few minutes but it was not visible in my camera's viewfinder (digital still camera with video capability) so i was just pointing and praying something showed up, as the object was visible to the naked eye. i did get footage of the object after i moved locations, but it doesn't look like anything except a really bright small star in the middle of the day. this object moved too slowly to be a plane crossing the sky (at any distance)or shooting star, and much too quickly to be a star or planet. it moved and then stopped and stood still for a few moments twice in the period of time that we watched it which is not something that you would expect from a star or planet or shooting star. we had to leave the dog park soon after the object moved the second time but it was still just sitting in the same location not moving. i didn't really want to leave but i sincerely thought that it was not going to be visible on film as i couldn't see it through the viewfinder so i didn't really mind. i live about two miles north of the dog park in north park with no large trees around to obstruct your view and as soon as we got home around 4:45pm-5:00pm i scoured the sky for this object but it was no longer visible anywhere in the sky. i am attaching some of the footage that i shot of this object, but once again, there is nothing visible in most of it. i know someone else had to have seen these things in the middle of the day and i thought it prudent to report this in case i could corroborate someone else's claim. out of the six separate clips that i have, this thing is visible in only two that i am attaching. i am attaching the last video solely for the audio as it was taken almost as soon as we spotted the object and you can hear my girlfriend describe what she was seeing as well. the objects are not visible but you can hear us talking about what we were seeing as we are seeing it. i must apologize for the language on the last video and if you are easily offended just skip the last one- sorry! i must add that my girlfriend just graduated from ucsd with two degrees and that i am about to start attending ucsd next year- we are both college educated and have both seen our share of planes, helicopters, stars, shooting stars and planets."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like"}
