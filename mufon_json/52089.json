I first noticed the object when I looked up at the sky, as I always do. At first, I thought it was a plane. However, I realized it wasn't as it was just hovering there in the sky, lights randomly flashing, the brightness dimming at first, then instantly brightening up! I can honestly say that I freaked out a bit. I knew for sure that that object was indeed not a plane! Nervousness filled up inside me, yet I was still excited at the same time! That leads to how I lost sight of the object; Curious to see much more than I could, I ran inside to get my binoculars. Of course, when I came back outside, the object was gone! Just like that. It was a spectacular sighting."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.419062,+-71.056378(52089)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52089) map </A>"}
