It was around 4am in the morning... I decided to go to the Warby Ranges which is around 10 minutes from where I lived... As I was drivng out there I noticed a large light about 20 ft off the ground approximately.... I pulled the car over and got out.... I had the radio on and was looking at the light when the radio went off and that song from DJ Visage back in the early 80's ... We fade to grey came on the radio..... I got out of there quick smart... Absolutley crapping myslef.... I really don't believe it meant me any harm but for some reason I was really scared maybe from the crap I have seen on the idiot box over extraterrestrials and UFO's so I have had a fear of UFO's ever snce and I truely believe deep down that if that was an alien craft it really didn't mean to hurt me in anyway...."]}
