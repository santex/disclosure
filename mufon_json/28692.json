I had a feeling to just look up and when I did they were there. They just hoovered and never moved. I took a picture. There are two objects. They are both close to the trees in the picture to the left. If you zoom in they look really interesting. Then when I got home there was one hoovering over my house with a red ring of lights around it. I tried to get a picture of this but it evaportated into the clouds. No kidding it disappeared like in the movies. They were not planes. Planes move. I have never really given stock all of this stuff, but I am slowly changing my mind and after this I am really changing my mind. I am excited since maybe now I can decided if I really believe or not. Leaning more towards time travelers then little green men."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28692.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28692.html"],"City":"Smyrna","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Tennessee","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
