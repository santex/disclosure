I saw a \"comet\" and then it started sparkling in different colors, then I knew it wasn't a comet. It looked like a disco ball with all of these light beams coming out of it. i don't know what those things were used for, maybe to stun it's prey(my cow Queen). It had this blue laser beam that sucked up my cow. They only took one, but they didn't bring it back. I don't know what they did to it, and I don't think I want to know. The whole thing scares me. I thought for a brief second, maybe they are nice, but I didn't even want to try. I don't want to end up like Queen you know."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02252007-0002","Longitude":"-120.544701","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6459.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6459.html"],"trends":[],"Case Number":"6459","Region":"Oregon","Country":"United States"}
