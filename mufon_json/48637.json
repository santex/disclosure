When it ended I went to call my dad and then i realized that everyone was looking up at the sky. I turned to look and I saw it. At first I thought it was a firework ember that was still lit. But it wasn't falling like one would. It was descending but very slowly. Then I was afraid it was some kind of meteor or comet that was heading towards us and I drove forward thinking I would get out of the way of it. Then I realized it wasn't far away like I originally thought. It was very close. Possibly a few feet above the building we were next to. It was very bright and orange. It floated towards the building and then disappeared behind it. When we drove around the building to try and see it... it was gone."],"Region":"Oklahoma","Tags":"City","City":"Oklahoma City","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 01:23 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48637.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48637.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 78 other sightings in Oklahoma City","There were no other sightings in Oklahoma City on or around July 4th 2013"],"Summary":"appeared after firework show ended.
