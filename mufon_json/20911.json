I thought it was mars but it was too big and bright so I concluded it was a ufo. it was about 300 feet off the ground absolutely still and about 250-400 feet wide it also was a fiery red. I managed to take one photo which is very fuzzy. after it disappeared by fading away at this time I had a ringing in my ears and I was puzzled. I reported it but everyone thought I was crazy. so I came here."],"Region":"Maryland","Sighting Duration":"01:01:17","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Laurel","There were no other sightings in Laurel on or around July 12th 2005"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20911.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20911.html"],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","City":"Laurel","Date of the Event":"07/12/2005 05:03 UTC","Longitude":"-76.844486","Summary":"Red firey sphere.","Country":"United States","Case Number":"20911","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Insignia, Other","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Fireball, Sphere, Other, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.102825,+-76.844486(20911)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20911) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/07/2009 07:02 UTC"}
