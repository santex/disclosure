While standing there , I noticed a large , bright , triagular shapedobject in the night sky , directly over mid town Omaha , Ne. I live near theairport , and at first thought it was a big jet readying to land . As I stoodoutside smoking my cigarette , I noticed the object was not getting any closerto my house . If it were a commercial airplane , it would have usually passedover my house to get to the airport , going from SW to NE . This object stayedin the same spot for another 10 min. and I brought it to my nephew brother - in- laws attention as they left for a Christmas program . My nephew said it seemedto pulse . I went inside to call a friend who lives about 7 miles south of menear downtown Omaha , and he said could see something very bright in thatdirection , but was somewhat obscured from his vantage point .I proceeded to call the local news stations to inquire if anyone else had seenit or if they knew what it was . They were all interested , but did nt know ofanything . I went back out after warming up and getting off the phone , and theobject was gone . When initially seeing the anomaly , I noticed a few stars inthe sky , and noticed they were in the same spots i had viewed them , ruling outcloud cover blocking ouy the object."],"Case Number":"2748","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Summary":"triangular shaped , brightly lit anomaly","Source":"MUFON","City":"Omaha","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.255233,+-95.989478(2748)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2748) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"12/16/2003 06:05 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Omaha","There were no other sightings in Omaha on or around December 16th 2003"],"Region":"Nebraska"}
