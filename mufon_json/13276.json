(there were also four other kids out there) after setting it up for him i went back inside the house. about 5-7 min later one of the kids came in and said that they see a ufo and i thought it was a satelite. she said that it was right above the house and that was when i ran outside and caught the trail end of 6-8 of these objects. it was about 5-7 min later that she came and told me that they were back so i grabbed the video camera and recorded as much as i could. i have never seen anthing like that before. the objects traveled from a north course to a northwest course and then back to north course moving slow and making no noise. the objects slowly went out of sight. the objects resemble something that i watched on the history channel or one of the other channels that were observed by the military. i will send the video if i can get it converted. quality is not very good."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/13/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[],"Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13276.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13276.html"]}
