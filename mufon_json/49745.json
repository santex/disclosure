{"Summary":"2 occurances red/orange glowing slient lights. 1 passed over head, then next time 2 on same trajectory","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting enjoying the night sky meditating. Opened eyes, saw very bright lights elongated shape moving low in sky. No noise. Always with the planes there is noise. We are on a flight path. But these were close and coming out the south. Very unusual. Then it came around again. Either the same one or another on the same route. Could not figure out what it was. Then shortly after, another came and right behind it another on its heel, like a baby light following its mother. All the same color on the on the same path. All at the same altitude. Came in to discover more about them and they seem to be everywhere. Came into house to get binoculors but they didn't return. Must be something to it since I would never take this time to write it down here. Very, very unusual."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-71.54188","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08112013-0044","Case Number":"49745","Region":"Rhode Island","City":"South Kingstown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"08/11/2013 11:09 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49745.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49745.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.45065,+-71.54188(49745)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49745) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"41.45065","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/11/2013 10:20 UTC","trends":["There have been 66 other sightings in South Kingstown","There were no other sightings in South Kingstown on or around August 11th 2013"]}
