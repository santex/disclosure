I was a young child 4-6 years old so it was between 1961-1964. My father and I were driving back from the Flemington fair in Flemington NJ, It was late in the evening and we were cutting through the Hopewell NJ area to get home to Ewing township which is near Trenton the state capital. The Hopewell area had lots of farms and tree filled areas. The UFO was hovering over a barn about 100 feet over the barn just about 500 linier feet off of the road. It was large about 500 square feet in size. The UFO was cube shaped with a few portholes that looked like windows in the middle around the object. The object had different colored lights around it. Some were steady and some were pulsing dimmer and then brighter. Please note: I am now 51 years old and in sound mind. But as I am writing this letter with tears streaming from my eyes, I have huge chills flying up my spine. I also feel scared and very uneasy. This happens every time I think about this. I will continue. As my father and I drove passed this object I lost my ability to move and talk. I was sitting in the back seat at the time and I was almost totally paralyzed. My father just kept on driving. He did not talk to me at all until we arrived back at our home about 30 minutes later. I had no idea what a UFO was at the time of this sighting and I could not move or talk until my father and I arrived at home. After we arrived home I could then move and talk again. I was hysterical and I cried and cried. I told both of my parents about not being able to move and talk which was mainly why I was freaking out. I also told them about the large object hovering over the barn and I explained that was when the paralyses started. My father never saw a thing and he thought that I was crazy to be acting this way. I can remember my mother yelling at my father telling him that I would not be hysterical for no reason at all and drilling him about what really happened. He just said that he never saw a thing. This is my UFO experience! I often wonder if there was more to this then I can remember because it still affects me so strongly to this day. I am weirdly still afraid that this could re-occur. Please share this with others."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.333333,+-74.816389(13729)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13729) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"09/03/1962 11:01 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11152008-0012","Longitude":"-74.816389","Summary":"My Sighting Documentation","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Object Features":"Window(s)"}
