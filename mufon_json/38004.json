Latitude = 33.3286, Longitude = -111.8063 My wife, neighbor lady and I were sitting in the drive way watching the \"super moon\" starting at 8:20 pm local time when about 8:50 pm something made me look up and I noticed a dim fuzzy white cloud like object moving from the North to South. I told my wife and neighbor lady to look up and we all watched a cloud moving rather fast with no sound or blinking lights like a plane has. The object then started a turn to the East and passed in front of the moon and we could see it change to solid black triangle. As it went past the moon it returned to a dim fuzzy white cloud and faded out of sight as it continued traveling East."],"Date of the Event":"05/05/2012 08:50 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.327123,+-111.822621(38004)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38004) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38004.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38004.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
