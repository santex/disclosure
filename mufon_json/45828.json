(so 15 seconds traveling 10 miles =) (600 miles per hr = 6 seconds = 1 mile), it maybe had some of a energy stream behind it or more like residual image , they looked like dark colored blobs- one blue one orangish one green, against a dark sky, very hard to see sometimes, nothing effected them and they effected nothing, little or no feelings of anything, apx size maybe a inch wide 2 nd date, a few week later��� 2-3 people similar, but only one, was stationary (probably) the other one flew around a lot, after a minute or two 1 came in at maybe 20,000ft very fast from sorta in front of us to our area from too far away to see, then another one just behind it but harder to see that one, part of the time the one above us changed shape into a apx saucer with a big dome on top type shape, i think one faded away one flew of with another and not sure what happened to the 3 & fourth one anymore 3rd date ��� maybe a year later maybe only 1-2 1 was maybe there maybe not it \\ object was too dark to tell, the 2nd one was only visible a few seconds off and on over 3-8 minutes, i was with another non relative guy who first saw it and saw it better than i did at first then by the time i saw it maybe 30 seconds later it was darker and harder to see but closer to us, maybe 10,000ft maybe 15 degrees down from the middle of the sky,"],"Region":"Minnesota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45828.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45828.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/22/2013 02:07 UTC"}
