We were looking up at the sky when something flew past us. There were three lights appearing to be in formation. As the lights flew closer, we could see the outline of a single objects, which appeared to be the source of these three lights. These lights faded and extinguished and the object appeared to slow down. We could clearly see a triangular shaped object. There were no lights other than the three which had extinguished. After a minute or two, the object had passed our field of view and was gone."]}
