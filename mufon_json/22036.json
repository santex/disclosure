The reason I saw it was because I had some pigeons behind my girlfriends house and I was alwys looking skyward. The object stayed in the same place for over an hour.I wasn't sure what it was.When I came out later it was gone. I looked for it every day after that and never saw it again. If it was a weather baloon I figued it would appear again at the same time. The address of the house in Kyoto was 10 Higashi Fukunokwa Okazaki Kyoto, Japan.I'm not sure of the date but it was in the summer. The area was in the city and consisted of regular houses."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Oval","Sighting Duration":"01:15:00"}
