I'm a rationalist and naturally skeptical. I agree with Einstein, for example, when he said the Bible is nothing but a bunch of childish stories. However, every now and then I read something like the woman who submitted the report below, and I wonder how many others like her have stopped taking their meds. I feel sorry for her, but there must be some other site where she post can such paranoid rubbish. A plea to other nuts--stay off this site. Serious reports only."],"Summary":"Response to \"VIDEO OF ORB AND FLASHING MULTICOLOR TRIANGLES IN BEDROOM\"","Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"39.557001","trends":["there has been one other sighting in cms\\tg","there were no other sightings in cms\\tg on or around"],"Disposition":"Hoax","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.557001,+-105.776507(14382)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14382) map </A>"}
