No flashing lites. dimly lit. Orange glow. Going across the sky at speed a little faster than passenger jets. Stright trojectory, then all of a sudden, the object stops and hovers. Makes some irratic movements. I had a flashlight and shined it at the object and attempted to mimic the same movements as I saw doing. To my amazement, the object imediately turned off its lights. They actually dimmed as they went out. This was not a case of autokenesis, as I did look at it through a telescope and witnessed it moving in the scope. I remained dim for several minutes. Then it slowly turned its lights on and after watching it for a few minutes and left in the same path it was taking."],"Date of the Event":"12/14/2009 10:20 UTC","Region":"Arkansas","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in El Dorado","There were no other sightings in El Dorado on or around December 14th 2009"],"City":"El Dorado","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.21437,+-92.661577(21265)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21265) map </A>","Latitude":"33.21437","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"21265","Summary":"Sky clear.
