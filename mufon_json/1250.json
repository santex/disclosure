Ilooked straight up (thinking to see a hawk) and saw this black coffin shapedobject flying directly away from me at a high, straight, steady, rate of speeduntil it disappeared behind some trees directly in front of me. I then realizedit was no hawk and thought of getting my binoculars, but there was no time. Atits rate of speed, it would have crossed the entire sky, directly over me inabout 6 sec. I heard the whistle 1 more time before I lost sight of it. Myimpression was that it was low, 800 to 1500 ft.
