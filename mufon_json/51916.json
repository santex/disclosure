I am sleeping during the recordings but I am checking these recordings the following day. I am recording a lot of meteors and planes. During the night of October 28, 2013 in the little village Cernovice u Tabora in South Bohemia I did a recording of two flying and blinking objects with two different shapes that do not look to me as airplanes. The date and time on the video recordings are not correct for unknown reasons. I do see airplanes in this region so maybe these are just ordinary airplanes. I don't know. I did not witness it myself. I will continue to do my nightvision recordings."],"Country":"Czech Republic","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"51916","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.372657,+14.960892(51916)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51916) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/29/2013 08:37 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Other","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Černovice","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON"}
