I opened them to see what was so bright, then I saw 3 bright white lights forming a perfect triangle with a dull red pulsating light in the center of the object. I got very excited, and had the mind set to grab my camera which has a video recorder, opened my back door and started shooting the video. It made no noise and moved very slowly across the sky along the tree line. This was approximately at 11:45 pm on January 5, 2012. The triangle object started to turn on a yaw axis,and continued to rotate counter close wise which showed multiple lights. It was very dark in color, such as black. It vanished in a split second."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34658.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34658.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"32.043246","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Pooler","There was one other sighting in Pooler on or around January 5th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.043246,+-81.229875(34658)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34658) map </A>"}
