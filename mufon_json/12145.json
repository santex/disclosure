I couldn't see the body because the ditch was deep but I did see a head of what appeared to be the long eared Chupacabra I saw earlier this month. The head appeared to be hopping forward (North) as I was driving south so I didn't get the best look at him. It didn't react to my vehicle. It hopped a total of three times before I passed the Chupacabra really fast at 55-60mph. The grey head appeared to have long ears, big eyes and a long face looking downward. I stopped the car and veered to the side off the road and backed up to see if the Chupacabra was still there. I didn't see the creature. All I could see was a local hospital situated far in the background. There were plenty of trees and bushes to hide in."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"07/28/2008 04:00 UTC"}
