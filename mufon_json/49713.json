The dogs across the road have been a constant problem for people trying to get asleep, so I have been making complaints to the Noise Patrol about noise nuisance. The dogs are very noisy anytime night and day. I had been filming dogs making a noise as evidence. A few weeks later I was transfering video footage from my smartcard to my netbook. Going through the footage I came across this recording. At the time when I did this I was not aware of the lights in the sky as I was more focused recording the noise acrooss the road.I was just standing there with the camera in my hands. I have seen ufos twice before in my teenage years. The first time I viewed it I was a bit spooked.Just for yourselves what these lights are.I have seen similar sightings all around the world on you-tube and other sites as well."]}
