So as I was looking north east the night sky was beautiful and when I looked directly up and a little behind me I saw a bright object which at first I thought was a star but it was moving slowly so I thought it had to be a plane but I didn't see any lights flashing so I just kept looking straight up at it. It had a bright light around it with what I would call a cross but a fat cross inside of it. It kept traveling northeast and getting a little faster and light was getting dimmer and then gone. It had to go the speed of light. I got the chills and my eyes watered and I said thank you."],"Case Number":"39741","Summary":"It was very bright white ring around it with a fat cross in the middle","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.254148,+-94.328427(39741)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39741) map </A>","Longitude":"-94.328427","Log Number":"US-06232012-0014","Date Submitted":"06/23/2012 03:26 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Region":"Ohio","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cross","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
