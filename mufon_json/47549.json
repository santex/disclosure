Filmed duration of event and uploaded the footage to youtube. At first it was 2 bright white lights with a small flickering light. Then one smaller light \"dims\" on beside the two other lights. That smaller light then appears to morph or change into 2 small lights. Then atleast one more light turns on after that. Then all the lights take a formation of a triangle shape. There was atleast 6 white lights on this unknown craft. I did not hear any sound. I don't know what the object was but it did not appear to be an airplane."],"trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around May 20th 2013"],"Longitude":"-79.989476","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"00:01:55","Date of the Event":"05/20/2013 09:20 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"47549","Summary":"UFO Triangle Fake Plane May 20 2013 Washington County Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-05212013-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47549.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47549.html"],"Country":"United States","City":"Pittsburgh","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.448785,+-79.989476(47549)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47549) map </A>"}
