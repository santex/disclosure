(Who have all recommended that I have these tapes seen by professionals who know what they are looking at.)It is due to the serious statements made by my friends who have seen these tapes that have made me finally come forward with them. I am asking that someone please contact me ASAP. This is no hoax or prank, and I believe that I have seen something I was not supposed to have witnessed, let alone tape with my camcorder.
