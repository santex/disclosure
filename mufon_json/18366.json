I had my camera and took a picture and un-belivably I caught it, and then it just dissappeared! It was like Chrome discs in the sky. I still am in dis-belief but I know what I saw."],"Region":"Colorado","City":"Platteville","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Platteville","There were no other sightings in Platteville on or around July 28th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
