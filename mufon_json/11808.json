(there was no \"mirror image\" of the smaller white light band on both sides of the larger light band, only that the smaller light band trailed the larger band and was smaller in width... question: \" has others reported similar observations of \"out of focus\" sections of craft\\objects???\" to answer the mufon questions: 1) something (in my mind) told me to turn around and look up into the sky. i actually started to walk up the stairs to my cabin, but i stopped dead in my tracks and turned around to see this incredible object! 2)the object was in clear sight and the afternoon was perfectly clear and still (minimal wind (if any)). everything was extremely still, but i did hear the sound of crickets. *** the very interesting thing i recall now was that there was nobody on the lake (not anybody in screaming distance to call to) to observe the object. this alone is somewhat unique in that at that time of day usually there are numerous fishermen, boats, swimmers, people on their docks. i purposely looked around all the docks on our small bay and i was alone with that 'object'. 3)i immediately thought the object was a ufo and that i was observing something that was not of this planet. 4)my first reaction was to run up the stairs and get my wife to observe, but i felt that if this was going to be my only time in life to observe a craft like this i would \"turn on\" all my observational skills and intently take it all in (in real time). i purposely turned away from the 'object' for a few seconds and then looked back at the craft to see if i was not dreaming and every time the 'object' had moved to the position i thought it would be in... just further along its vector trajectory path. 5) to say i was excited would be an understatement as you can imagine, but the event was so \"incredible\" i have relived it thousands of times over and over in my mind. i can't stop thinking about this event for some reason... i have tried to convey everything that occured those 2 minutes in my life and i hope that some individuals can relate to the profound impact that an event like this has on a persons life..."],"Date Submitted":"06/05/2003 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Eagle River","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Eagle River","Log Number":"US-07292008-0012","Latitude":"45.93239","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11808.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11808_submitter_file1__AKDrawing.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11808.html"]}
