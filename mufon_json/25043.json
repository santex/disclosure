A passenger aircraft was flying over to the north of us and I looked up at it. I then notice four greyish black disc like shapes moving near the aircraft but moving south of it. They were almost directly overhead us at the nearest point. The four objects were moving at the same speed and appeared to be rotating and moving. I told my daughter to quickly run inside and get the camera as I felt they were something unusual. They were quite far by the time I took the photos and I had to fully zoom in. The sky was overcast and cloudy which made them more visible."],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Mississauga","There were no other sightings in Mississauga on or around August 9th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.594425,+-79.63614(25043)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25043) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/09/2010 02:21 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc, Egg, Oval","Log Number":"CA-08092010-0015","Region":"Ontario","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.594425","Date of the Event":"08/09/2010 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-79.63614","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","City":"Mississauga"}
