I went out to pick it up. As I turned to go back in, a couple of ducks were flying in, they often land and rest under my blue spruce tree. When they say me they flew on south, going over our house. I would not have looked up to see the craft otherwise. It was quiet, a medium gray, from the way it would reflect light my first thought was that it was a balloon, I quickly discounted that idea because there was no wind and this thing was moving about 30 or 40 mph. It was 100 to 150 feet above the ground, going east, directly over our house. I heard no noise. The craft was aprox 20 feet long and a little less than that in width. It made no turns, in a few seconds it was out of sight. My brother has owned several planes, and I build and fly RC models, so I am familar with wing designs. I saw an experimental craft at oshkos that was about this size, made with a lifting body design. but there is a big difference in trailing edges. This craft (UFO) had none.
