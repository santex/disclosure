It was a series of prolonged light flashesdirectly across, then above then again across from our house. The lights changedfrom an initial pale sky blue to a greenish colour. It initially caught our eyesas lightening but it didnt fade away and was HUGE. The whole sky glowed and itwas a very dark windy night. The second flash lasted the longest and had themost intense colour.. It was as if something had been nuked. We had jsut turnedoff the television and were heading for bed. It scared us enough so that we bothturned form the window. When we went back after catching our breathes there wasno further sightings3E I have grown up in hte prairies and seen some crazy lightening phenomenon butnothing this big at this cold a temperature ( its 5 celcius ). We are right inthe city and are sure some others must have noticed.
