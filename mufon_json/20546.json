When I got to the junction, it seemed to have moved. It was west and east of the building at Lagies Junction. What I observed was a bright steady (not blinking) red light, it appeared to be about the size of a street light. It seemed to have moved from when I saw it first (driving) to when I passed it. I thought nothing more of it (other than it was wierd)until I went to the Mufon meeting in Ely last Sat. night. When I saw the films of the UFO, I was surprised that it was so small. When I got home, I realied that I had seen a light at Lagies Junction previously. I checked my bank account for charges in Wendover, and it was August 7, 2009. No photos, I just thought you'd be interesting in knowing that your sighting report was not the only time that lights were seen at that location."],"Longitude":"-116.415069","Case Number":"20546","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lagies Junction","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Lagies Junction","Date Submitted":"11/16/2009 04:11 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/07/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20546.html"],"Region":"Nevada"}
