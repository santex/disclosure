This building was \"abandoned\" but fortified (by me)and located at 621 East 9th Street, NYC, between Avenues B and C. The roof was 100' by 80'. The two craft had no surface features, and glowed dull orange. They seemed to be over the power station at Avenue D and Fourteenth Street and about four hundred feet in diameter, with one being about one third smaller than the other, or more distant. I walked around on the roof to try to judge size and position as best I could. There was another person with me. The objects just stayed up there with no motion until after I left. I felt calm and unexcited. I thought they were the \"astral paramecia\" type of UFO. I stayed up there about a half hour, and then went to bed. There was no indication of lost time or direct contact. This was the only time I ever saw a UFO, though I always believed they existed, and have read a few books about them."],"Log Number":"US-12072007-0004","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"40.719453","Summary":"2 Dull orange illuminated spheres over powerstation in blackout","Object Features":"None"}
