We were speaking of the good times back in high school. I was sitting on my back porch while he was talking to me. I was looking up at the sky in between the tree lines towards union st. I saw a small piece of cloud sitting there and thought it was kind of strange. I continue my conversation with my friend and he started yapping on the phone. i was looking up and saw a plane or jet go above the the piece of cloud and then it completely disappeared? I guess it was not a piece of the sky? Very strange for me to be looking right up at what I thought was apiece of cloud then in takes off or something and disappears? any Ideas?"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18673","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.960925,+-75.157089(18673)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18673) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
