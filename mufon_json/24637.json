{"Case Number":"24637","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy lady friend and me were walking home from somewhere. When we were in the pre-school parking lot I saw my lady friend look up. Then I looked up seconds later, and I saw a perfectly round disc shaped object directly over my head. As soon as I saw it it was already speeding away straight up. Actually I just got a glimps of it, but could see it had pink and violet swirls on it that seemed to be alive. It measured about 2 feet in diameter. It quickly disappeared into space."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","City":"Anaheim","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.841353,+-117.913414(24637)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24637) map </A>","trends":["There have been 55 other sightings in Anaheim","There were no other sightings in Anaheim on or around February 14th 1991"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere, Other","Longitude":"-117.913414","Date of the Event":"02/14/1991 06:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"My lady friend saw it first but said nothing.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24637.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24637.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-07182010-0029","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"07/18/2010 10:17 UTC","Latitude":"33.841353","Tags":"City"}
