{"Region":"Pennsylvania","divs":["sighting detailslast night 9\\6\\2013, i was walking my dog around 9:00 p.m. (i took video at 8:58 p.m.) when i saw what i thought was a hot air balloon high in the sky, because i could see flames. this was moving in a straight line and too fast to be a balloon and way too high in the sky. then i thought that maybe it was a plane on fire but it wasn't falling and it kept moving across the sky. i took out my phone and videotaped it. i was really expecting for whatever it was to suddenly explode but it just kept moving across the sky until it the fire either went out or it just disappeared."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Fireball seen over Southside Easton, PA","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","City":"Easton","Date Submitted":"09/06/2013 05:24 UTC","Latitude":"40.676707","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-75.217811","Case Number":"50463","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.676707,+-75.217811(50463)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50463) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50463.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50463.html"],"Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Easton","There were no other sightings in Easton on or around September 5th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09062013-0004","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"09/05/2013 08:58 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
