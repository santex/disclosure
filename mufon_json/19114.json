{"Date Submitted":"09/07/2009 07:53 UTC","divs":["sighting details at 6:30 pm, on dec.23 2007, i had stepped out onto the entrance landing at the finger docks area, where i was assigned as my job pick. i had a mug of coffee and lite a cigarette, it was around dusk, and i was curious if i might see holmes 17-p, so i leaned out so i could see the furthest towards the north east and maybe see it. no luck; anyway as i was panning my view from the northeast towards the east, i did a double take. it looked like a ornament suspended in the clouds. my first guess was that an air liner was aiming directly towards me,but that was not right. the object was a sphere with a solid black{?} band through the center with reticular boxes spaced above the black line. it did not have wings ,nor engines visible, also i saw no tail assembly dorsal\\ vertical lift wings. i spent 10 years in the navy as an o.s.,the last four at nato. i have a fair, to better than average knowledge of aircraft recon. this did not match anything i recalled. this craft did not seem to advance or withdraw, it merely sat there for 7 mississippi, then it was gone. it did not move off at a high rate of speed, it simply vanished. the question what did i think, very strange. i was not frightened, nor alarmed, i don't know why, but around six mississippi i raised my mug in salute and waved. after the event finished i turned around and drew what i saw on a sign attached to the wall at the entrance landing .its still there as of today. its not much of a story, on a weird ending note; i drafted a letter to one of the ufo mags, telling this event and some other strange past event, anyway as i hit send to transmit, my e=mail was not sent to the ufo mag. but wound up at the www.sen.gov.senator specter.com or something like that, well thats all."],"City":"Pittsburgh","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.448625,+-79.994796(19114)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19114) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Window(s)","Sighting Duration":"00:00:07","Summary":"at work/ having smoke outside/see Saturn like off white object /7 sec's observed / gone.","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19114.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19114.html"],"Case Number":"19114","trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around December 23rd 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09072009-0005","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"12/23/2007 06:30 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Latitude":"40.448625","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.994796","Country":"United States"}
