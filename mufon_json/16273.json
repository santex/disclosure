{"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["sighting detailswent out to look at the sky as usual, but felt compelled to go out at 10:30pm for some reason. i walked out to the edge of my fence (about 30' from my back door) and looked up toward the east. just above i saw the stars, then all at once two reddish\\orange oval shaped objects appeared. they flew in a straight line from south to north for about 15 seconds and disappeared into nothing! there was no sound. the lights were a dull reddish\\orange and didn't seem to emit any other light around them except to themselves. they appeared out of total darkness...just all at once, and were visible for only a few seconds before instantly disappearing. i've never seen anything like these lights. i couldn't tell if they were attached to each other, but they were going the exact same speed and one was a little to the side of the other. i feel so blessed to have seen these awesome lights! i just stood there in total disbelief, feeling in my heart these were star ships from somewhere else! if i never see additional lights like these in my lifetime i will still be happy to have seen these...they were amazing!"],"City":"Elma","Case Number":"16273","Region":"Washington","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Elma","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"03/26/2009 10:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-03272009-0002","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Two reddish/orange silent oval shaped lights.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/26/2009 10:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"47.003429","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.003429,+-123.408769(16273)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16273) map </A>","Longitude":"-123.408769","Object Shape":"Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16273.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16273.html"]}
