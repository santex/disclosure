I don't see it move, it's stationary, just blinking away red, blue, green, white, orange lights...I thought it was a plane at first, but it didn't move, other planes seem to fly above and below this object. I thought it could be a star so I looked at the stars that seemed close to this thing, but the stars were bluish white twinkling, not like this thing flashing, It felt like, to me, it wanted to be recognized like \"Hey Look at Me.\" I took my dogs back into the house, sat down to watch tv, but I couldn't get this thing out of my mind. So I went backout, and to my surprise, now two more of the same were in a triangular configuration, miles apart in the NE to E to SE sky all blinking away like crazy. Where I live, this is the area where the shuttle launches into space. Wish I a telephoto lens with a camera...this thing(s) don't appear every nite, but I have been noticing them more frequently."],"trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09212013-0005"}
