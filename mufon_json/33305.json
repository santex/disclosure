At first I thought it was a shooting star, but as I kept watching it, I noticed it was going slower than a normal shooting star. It was also larger than one, and the white color appeared to be pulsating in its brightness. The car in front of me hit their brakes, and I assumed it was because they saw it too. It was moving towards the northeast for approximately 10 seconds and then completely disappeared. Afterwards, I knew I had seen something definitely out of the norm, and almost even stopped the car in front of me to see if they saw it too. I had very good feelings and wasn't fearful."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33305.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33305.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.535331,+-87.352683(33305)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33305) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/12/2011 03:47 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Features":"Unknown"}
