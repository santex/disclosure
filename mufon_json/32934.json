The Coosa River is near on the right. We observed a large object traveling from southeast to northwest. As it cleared the treetops on the right side of the road, we saw a smaller object behind it that looked more like a plane and behind that a larger object that looked more like the first. The first and third objects had three lights on each side that were too far apart to be a plane and they didn't blink. The lights on these larger objects seemed to be attached to the object by appendages instead of being directly on the object. It was that time of day when it is not completely dark but not light so we couldn't really tell the shape of any of the objects. They flew very low and made no sound. They crossed the road and disappeared into the mountains that are directly on the left side of the road. The last object seemed to descend slightly which was very odd since it was already flying so low."],"Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"32934","trends":[],"Region":"Georgia","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-10282011-0018","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.161925,+-82.905663(32934)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32934) map </A>"}
