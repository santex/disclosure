{"Tags":"City","Summary":"Bright star hovering near Big Dipper.","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home south on I-435 in Kansas when i saw a bright star, that did not look familiar in the sky, near the Big Dipper. I've been watching the night sky a lot recently for multiple reasons, The ancient alien theory intrigues me and i think i have figured out what it all means and i do believe that they will return in 2012. So ive been looking up since the new year. I observed the light as bright but distant, further south. and as i drove near home the light, though stationary, became negligibly bigger. i arrived home and went to my room and looked outside. it was still there i got on google and searched images of the big dipper to see if i could explain what id seen.. but i couldn't. So i turned back out the window and then the star was gone."],"Date of the Event":"05/05/2012 09:52 UTC","Longitude":"-94.779729","Date Submitted":"05/05/2012 04:54 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Lenexa","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.97961,+-94.779729(37926)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37926) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"37926","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"38.97961","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37926.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37926.html"],"Log Number":"US-05052012-0007","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Kansas","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lenexa","There were no other sightings in Lenexa on or around May 5th 2012"]}
