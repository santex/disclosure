{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was standing in the front of a coffee shop here at Sac City College smoking a cigarette and looking up at the sky directly overhead four meteors. there were several each night his week.I then noticed four discs fying in formation from over the coffee shop to a northward direction! They were swift and quiet, no sound at all! They had no lights at all,but they reflected the ground illumination! as they passed they remained in perfect alignment! From a left-rear position to a right-front position in an angled straight line!i counted four saucers! This is my second sighting in my life! I was so exited I ran in the coffee shop and of course no one cared!they did not see it!My first sighting was already submitted and was around 2002 when the comet was visible for two weeks! In that incident there were five craft in the daytime over southern NJ moving north also!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13327.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"38.582572","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were 2 other sightings in Sacramento on or around October 26th 2008"],"Region":"California","Country":"United States","Case Number":"13327","Object Shape":"Disc","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.582572,+-121.4867(13327)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13327) map </A>","Date of the Event":"10/26/2008 10:25 UTC","Log Number":"US-10282008-0043","Longitude":"-121.4867","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/26/2008 10:25 UTC","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Sacramento","Summary":"Flew north at above 500 mph. made no sound. therer were FOUR crafts in angled back-left to front-right positioning!"}
