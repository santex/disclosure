I was taking pictures of a rainbow and in a series of shot from the same angle this shot was a middle one and shows a bizarre object. I thought maybe a it was sensor dust that is not the case because none of the other in the series shows this defect. This looks like a stealth aircraft closeup but I am not sure what it is. Look to the top left corner of the image."],"Region":"Arizona","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:00","Date of the Event":"07/07/2008 06:52 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
