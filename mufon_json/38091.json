{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI live not far from an airport so thought at first might be an airplane. But airplanes are not round and don't fly that low and make noise. I was sitting on the edge of my bed and glanced out the window and saw this round disc go over very quietly the tops of the trees it was maybe 9 to 11 at night. I looked and looked to determine shape. It was round with lights around the edges and a small red flashing light beneath. It was moving slowly and quietly. It just kept moving I think the direction of Illinois. As for feeling I am not scared of any visitors and as this is first time I ever saw something like this was a little surprised after hearing of others seeing this same sort of thing. I have mixed feelings thinking that it could have been made here in this country."],"Log Number":"US-05122012-0006","Latitude":"38.780113","City":"St Charles","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38091.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38091.html"],"Case Number":"38091","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-90.503727","Summary":"Iwas setting on edge of my bed.
