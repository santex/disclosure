I have been trying to get a good photograph of it for some time. I saw a small red spark shoot off the moon in the northerly direction from my perspective. It was red and very fast. I don't know if it was more than half a second but about that, that it traveled about 5 times the visual thickness of the moon. Then the red faded and I lost track of it. I have no description of the craft it was too far away."],"Longitude":"-80.079129","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.135664","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Erie","Case Number":"21971","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.135664,+-80.079129(21971)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21971) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/19/2010 02:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"02/22/2010 01:31 UTC","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Erie","There were no other sightings in Erie on or around February 19th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-02222010-0002"}
