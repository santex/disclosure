(i used the horizontal blinds as a means to measure the movement of this \"star\"). this star or object moved unlike any airplane or helicopter. in an up-down, zig-zag motion this object moved in a southwestardly direction. it was at this time i got up from my bed and moved closer to my window. i moved the horizontal blinds as to not obstruct my vision. the object was actually pulsating and would appear larger and brighter at times, and actually went from a whitish color to a more amber color when it was at its largest. the object continued to move in a southwestardly direction all the while it \"pulsed\". the pulses seemed rythmic, and continued, as it moved for about 3 minutes. i had to look away from time to time over the three minutes, as to make sure the object was actually moving in this unusual manner. i used other stationary stars as a means to determine the movement of this object. it is important to note that at end of this sighting i had a feeling that \"it\" was aware, that i was aware of its presence. it was unlike any experience i have ever had. i was not scared, but more like a feeling of not being alone. i felt like it knew i was watching it. this whole experience lasted about 3 minutes. the object simply pulsated and then disappeared. no one was with me when i saw this object. my dogs were on my bed with me but seemed unaffected by it. once the object disappeared, i immediately got online and looked up ufo sightings in utah, more specifically moab. after about 1 1\\2 hours of research online i went back to bed around 4a.m. it was when i woke up again around 7am i decided i would try to contact elaine douglas of mufon. it is important to note that my home phone (land line) was working without incident, however beginning this morning there is alot of static with little to no volume. i will be calling fronteir communications to rectify the problem, but could the object i saw last night disrupted my phone service? i live in a rural community, so i do not want to start asking neighbors if they saw this object last night. i certainly saw something unlike any other in the sky last night. i hope this detailed account helps anyone interested. i will make sure to look in the sky tonight in the same direction to see if it returns."],"Date of the Event":"01/08/2007 02:13 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6115.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6115_submitter_file2__3-LaSalsitngJan07drawings.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6115.html"],"Latitude":"38.581536","Date Submitted":"01/08/2007 02:13 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"6115","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.581536,+-109.54434(6115)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6115) map </A>"}
