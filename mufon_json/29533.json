I first noticed a bright light in the sky so I grabbed my camera and by the time I was able to take the first picture it had already started to streak across the sky then turned into about four little lights then disappered. I was able to capture the four atttached pictres. Then when I got home I was on my balcony telling my neigbor what happened when I saw two helicopters a jet flying around they did two loops around where i saw the object then left.I was told that it was some kind of rocket thats why i have never sent the pictures in before but every time I see them it get me curious as to what it is that I captured on camera. If you could with my curiosity I would appreciate it.
