{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/27/2012 02:27 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas outside of Plymouth Wa. On Sandy beach on Washington side of Mcnary Dam. I was lying on my back in the sand listening to a podcast on my cellphone. I was watching for shooting stars while my two friends were skinny dipping, I had fallen on the way down to the beach and injured my ankle so was stuck sitting. I had already seen three shooting stars, but what I saw next looked nothing like a shooting star or a plane or Helicopter. I observed a bright light coming from the south crossing over the Columbia River. It was moving very fast, faster than any aircraft that I'm familiar with. Soon it was directly over me, it was bright white previously but it fleshed an amber color for maybe a second. When it flashed amber I could make out a faint triangular shape and could see briefly the one light flashed to three lights then back to one bright white light. It hovered for a for approximately 10 seconds then disappeared, and reappeared in a different part of the sky. It continued Nw for 30 more seconds then disappeared completely. I was not able to find it again. While this was happening my podcast had stopped playing but I was too busy watching the sky to care. After it was gone Grabbed my phone to check the time but my phone was completely dead. I had just charged it before I left the house. My phone holds a charge for days and I was less than a minute into my podcast so that should not have drained the battery. My husband and I saw another Ufo about a week earlier in Hermiston. Which I'll submit separately. As well as an increase in Helicopter traffic in the recent months. I read a report after this recent sighting of someone seeing a ufo on the 18th as well, over Hermiston. Also there were two sightings on the 23rd of December also in Hermiston."],"Latitude":"35.876368","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/19/2012 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08272012-0010","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering,Other","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.876368,+-76.739456(42061)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42061) map </A>","Longitude":"-76.739456","Region":"Washington","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42061.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42061.html"],"Case Number":"42061","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Plymouth","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"ufo over McNary Dam","City":"Plymouth","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
