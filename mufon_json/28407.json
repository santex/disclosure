Anyways long story short when i decide that i am going to bed i get up and started to take my contacts out i noticed this strange but somehow familiar object. I stopped doing what i was doing and focused in on the object, which was very, very close to me from my window and was staring down at me. The UFO was circular and i could only see the light on the inside of the craft, with a being inside it, but could only see the outline of his body... which was black because it was dark out and the only bright light was inside of the craft. It was not human, but humanoid, because it had a noticeably bigger head than a humans. Shorty after i noticed it, it rotated away from me and shot of towards the sky. I can still show where it shot off too this day, and have seen multiple sightings since."],"Case Number":"28407","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/20/2010 11:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/25/2011 08:00 UTC","City":"Allegan","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s)","Source":"MUFON"}
