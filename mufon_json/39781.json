The time was 2200hrs. We looked up to admire the clear sky. We observed a bright light moving at approximately 119 degrees. The initial impression was that it was a satellite. However, it was too bright and too low and moving too fast. We observed this for about 2-3 minutes. The light dimmed and then vanished. There was no trail observed either. A plane was seen shortly after traveling at 90 degrees to the trajectory of the observed object."],"Summary":"We saw something bright and moving throught the sky.
