I' m guessing we were at 10,000 feet. I had window seat, look out window and see \"unbelievably clearly....a orange ball, the size of big rubber kids kickball, pass right by plane just below opposite direction. Not sure if it was moving, because we were. Could've been stationary. Blew my mind. Really wanted to scream did anyone see that. Perfect orange ball? What the heck???? Decided to look at this website to see if any similar sightings in area and freaked when someone mentioned orange orb a few days earlier??????"],"City":"Phoenix"}
