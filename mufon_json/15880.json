I tghiought that was movimng too fast for a plane and the object which never blinked made a 90 degree right turn for about two- three seconds and almost as if it saw me point it out to my fiancee , it made another 90 degree turn right and headed east. The object was light orange in color and I heard nothing. I jumped out of the hot tub ran to the north side of my home and it was gone. I have hever seen anythin move like this. The entire sighting was only about 10-12 seconds, but it was no plane and no helicopter. As I am writing this I am still a bit shaken- I ahve never seen anything move as this did"],"Case Number":"15880","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.61195,+-75.483213(15880)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15880) map </A>"}
