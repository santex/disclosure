It slowly went past and was gone just like that. At first we thought it was a cloud but it was clear that night and a few nights later I saw a cloud and the city lights illuminated it, Thats when I knew it wasn't a cloud. I cant say much more because we didn't see anything except black. The way this moved over us and blacked out the stars was eerie, I remember we both looked at each other and were puzzled. But didn't think much of it at the time, Were were interested in the meteor shower. The object moved North to South, Very slowly."],"City":"Midvale","Tags":"City"}
