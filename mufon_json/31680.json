Thought ufo's were talk but after seeing that it made my mind different. I was paranoid all night. My neighbor almost instantly went blank for quite some time. watched until they flew away 10 minutes or so later. They were all migrating as it looked. some waited, some kept going. Others seemed to be watching, almost as a tour of our planet. attmpted several times to get video or camera...neither would show the lights. would show everything else in picture, but the lights and they were very b right!"]}
