Planes always come from east to west to land at Jean-Lesage international airport. On June 4th 2013 around 11h05-11h10pm, I started looking at the beautiful sky and stars. For the entire month of May, I had not been able to look so much at the stars because of the bad wheather. Then while looking at the sky, an object with very bright white lights under it suddently appeared in the sky at 90 degrees angle just above my head. The object was flying west to east at jet fighter speed but made no soundI could hear. I took my googles to have a better look at it. It was obviously not an airplane. It had at least 5 to 7 very whitish bright lights undert it. I lost sight of the object after 2 minutes max. Object was gaining altitude and disappeared in the sky eastward. Only feeling I had was that this was not a plane."],"Date of the Event":"06/04/2013 11:18 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47892.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47892.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/05/2013 08:15 UTC"}
