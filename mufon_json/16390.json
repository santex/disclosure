They moved in unison, changed directions several times, then disappeared after about ten seconds. The lights appeared to be a dull, dark red and did not flash or blink. Estimated altitude of several thousand feet. No sound. Again, way faster than any plane or satellite. About the same speed of a \"shooting star\" except these three lights changed directions and moved together."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.980397,+-122.023336(16390)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16390) map </A>","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Santa Cruz","There were no other sightings in Santa Cruz on or around April 2nd 2009"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"Three lights either in formation or part of one vehicle over Monterey Bay / Santa Cruz","Longitude":"-122.023336","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.980397","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Santa Cruz"}
