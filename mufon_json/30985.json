{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friends and I were sitting out on their front porch, watching the stars. They live in the mountains so there is always a good view. Initially when I spotted the object, I thought of it as a satellite, and pointed it out to my friends. But we then realized that it was travelling much too fast to be anything of that nature. It was white in color and moving quickly. It emitted a first flash and picked up speed, then after a few seconds another flash, and had disappeared completely from sight."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/03/2011 10:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"32.861642","City":"Lakeside","Log Number":"US-08182011-0014","Case Number":"30985","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Lakeside","There were no other sightings in Lakeside on or around August 3rd 2011"],"Date Submitted":"08/18/2011 11:30 UTC","Summary":"Viewed an unidentified flying object that flashed once, then again, then disappeared","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30985.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30985.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.861642,+-116.916379(30985)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30985) map </A>","Longitude":"-116.916379"}
