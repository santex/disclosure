I was taking a walk on my street and i was down by my local legion when i noticed a really bright light up over the hill in the woods, It looked like a white street light. I immediately went towords it and noticed that it was farther away then i thought and it wasnt a street light. Then i thought it had something to do with the airport being neear by so i watched , it didnt seem like it was moving it seemed like it was searching, then all of a sudden the light just dropped into the woods and went out. then i knew it was a ufo. So after i seen it land i started to run home and im running up my street which was towords where i seen it land and there again in the sky between some houses there it is again. Immediattley i run across the lawns and into an open spot on a hill to get a better look and im focusing on it. The bright light is dimming and is accompanied by two smaller red lights that could be seperate or part of the same object, they seem to tilt around a bit as they drop into the woods and vanish."],"Longitude":"-60.189154","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 11:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-07042010-0029","Region":"Nova Scotia","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"24146","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24146.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24146.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/04/2010 11:43 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"46.13952","Summary":"Bright light dims then lands.","City":"Sydney","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Sydney","There were no other sightings in Sydney on or around July 4th 2010"]}
