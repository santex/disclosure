It doesn't look like a bird or any aircraft I am familiar with. I reported this before and never got any response. Everytime I view the picture it puzzles me. I am attaching the photo. I put a location, time and date in the required fields on this form, but they are wrong since I was not there, I do not know the man in the photo and have no clue where he was or what the date and time were. I am sure I can find out though."],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-116.414009","Log Number":"US-06042013-0015","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/04/2013 09:51 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":[],"Date of the Event":"08/12/2011 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"38.80609","Summary":"going through some google Earth photos and noticed an orb in the sky."}
