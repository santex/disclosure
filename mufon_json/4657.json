Being a former AF pilot, knew this could not be familiar aircraft at that speed or motion. I pulled over to try to get it on camera but it was too late. They seemed to stay in or behind the cloud. Many cumulus scattered clouds today."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4657.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4657.html"],"Log Number":"US-04072006-0002","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Rio Linda","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/06/2006 12:25 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Region":"California"}
