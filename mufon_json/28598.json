I can't recollect anything happening to me last night, but when I woke up this morning I has a bad sharp pain in my hand. It is seven hours later now and it still hurts. When I looked closely at my hand I could see a tiny triangle mark that is lighter than the rest of my hand and it is in the exact spot where the pain is. I took a magnet and ran it over my hand and it started to hurt worse. I don't know if it is a coincidence or in my head but even as I am typing this it is hurting. I tried to take pics but they did not come out well. It doesn't show anything really, but I did put arrows on the pics to show te source of the pain. So I have no idea if it is from an abduction or not."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-112.460502","City":"Prescott","Latitude":"34.545124","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Prescott","There were no other sightings in Prescott on or around April 9th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"04/09/2011 04:39 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Possible abduction??","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
