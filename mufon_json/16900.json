{"divs":["sighting detailswind calm, quiet night, clear and cool, low 50s. no bugs or frogs making any noises in the woods, which is unusual. rural area, surrounded by mostly woods and farmland near the top of 1280 elevation in murrysville, westmoreland county, pa. my fiancee and i were watching tv in living room, when amber\\orange, size of a big pea at arms length, kinda round , \"light\" caught our eyes in patio window on left of tv. as we ran out patio door onto deck, (grabbing the camcorder and waiting for the dang thing to boot up) we could see was headed ene in silent, constant speed, no flashing lights. in fact, the light it was emitting was constant, glowing--not super bright, not exactly round, blurry like. i noticed that it did not move in a straight line, more of a slight snake-like wiggle as it moved. as it continued on it's path, it dropped down behind the trees at edge of the yard--fiancee said he thought he saw a smaller one with it (behind the trees by now and falling) said, \"it's gonna crash, it looks like\", as he supposed it would come in contact with the ground at that point, but i think perhaps it was an illusion caused by the arc-like trajectory. tried to video it, but even on 'nightshot' the cheap sony camcorder only has a black screen--so all you'll get from it is me saying what a piece of sh#& it is. called john ventre about 9:30, he saw a moving high altitude light moving in a similar wiggling motion from his location. i'm wondering if it's the same kind (orange or amber) that's been seen in england, holland and other places lately. like this video: http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=cjaubt6ljsm&feature=channel_page a lot of those are diamond shaped when seen up close. i couldn't see a shape, though."],"Case Number":"16900","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/12/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Murrysville","There were no other sightings in Murrysville on or around May 12th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.429602,+-79.687995(16900)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16900) map </A>","Latitude":"40.429602","Log Number":"US-05122009-0015","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16900.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16900.html"],"City":"Murrysville","Longitude":"-79.687995","Summary":"PA-Amber/orange glowing light, size of large pea at arms length, no tail/trail.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/12/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
