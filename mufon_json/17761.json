There were even more than usual. I usually check them every night, in hopes of seeing a shooting star or something unexplainable. While on the phone, what I thought was a stationary star suddenly began to float [for lack of a better word] across the sky. Over the next hour five more 'stars' did the same thing. One time a plane flew near as one was floating or gliding off. Three other stars just disappeared all together. I did see a shooting star..it was orangish and went down fast. Or maybe it was a meteor. Are there meteors that seem to be stars? Do they go so slow??? I have seen several meteor showers in my life. This was NOT like that. Only two of these 'stars' [at a time] flew in the same direction and I watched them until they glided out of view...I do have limited view... They were white like stars, small like stars and made no sound. Both planes I saw tonight made sound."],"Log Number":"US-07022009-0006","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-97.898058","Latitude":"31.132072"}
