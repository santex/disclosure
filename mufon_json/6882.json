{"Log Number":"US-04242007-0003","divs":["Sighting DetailsI am writing again because the unusual objects came back again. This time I brought my 2 brothers with me because the last sighting I had was that they would be back again. Tonight was a chilly night with the half moon to our far right as me and my siblings lay on the ground. My instructions in the beginning of our night out were to not talk and to just think. Despite my instructions, they constantly were talking which I thought would distract us to observe the night sky. One of brothers is 16 and the other is 14. My brother named T.J. (16 yrs.) was telling a story about some guys using a flash light to communicate with ���UFO���s���, but I did not take it seriously because it seemed somewhat simple. Despite my rejection of his idea, he got a flashlight anyway. So as we lay for about 2 minutes after his comment, there was a flash thousands of feet up. My younger brother noticed it, and then we all noticed it as it flashed again. It was directly and perfectly at our zenith as we lay stationary in our position where it was an indicator that it was meant for us. Of course I questioned it before I made that conclusion. It was a white flash thousands of feet up in the air, but I told them that we have to be critical of what we see, and skeptical to every degree as the ���UFO��� subject is a taboo one and is always susceptible to misidentifying objects in our sky. In the preparation of our night to see what I saw last night, I told them to observe all the craft in the air for a better comparison of when the objects do show themselves again, or if they do. The night before the lights indicated they will make themselves shown to me again and that is why I brought witnesses the next night. I did not bring my video camera because it is just a handy cam that only records blackness at night and doesn���t ever record the moon very well when it���s a full one. So as we looked at the flash that occurred every 11 seconds directly above us, I told them to wait and see if it moves into any direction that would indicate it was a plane with a flashing light. I thought it could have been the space station (maybe) or a satellite that happen to give off flashes every 11 seconds. As time went on, all indications showed that most likely it was neither of my guesses that I proposed. This object was defiantly signaling us, so I grab the flashlight that my brother had and signaled back. I signaled it out of sync with its signal, but after a while I decided to copy it at the exact time it signaled us. It was stationary and EXACTLY every 11 seconds it would flash which lasted a total of 5 minutes. My brother T.J. said that he was going inside because it was making him uncomfortable and he would be a witness if we got abducted, but I reassured him that it was just a flashing light and he should not worry because it is only going to get better and I didn���t believe we were going to get abducted. When the flashing stopped, 2 minutes past and 3 lights in perfect formation in equal distance from each other (one next to the other) came down out of the sky and were moving in a southeast to northwest direction. The size of the lights was as big as a star. When it came closer, the lights went out and the 3 objects where 500 ft. above us without any lights and the shape changed as it came down to something bigger (this is not unusual since when you get closer to something it gets bigger). A good comparison would be that of a car without any headlights that would pass by on a dark street which you would only see the car but you would have to look closely to see what kind of car it was. So when the 3 lights came down I pointed it out to my brothers with excitement, and we observed it as it went on its path. Again the difference between objects that we are familiar with that fly in our air, is that they seem mechanical in movement rather than a natural way of moving. The three objects seemed as big as a basket ball which would make them as big as an SUV if observing it close up, 500 ft above us, with no lights, and a white surface that seemed like a oval shape but not exactly (it was a very unique shape), also it made no sound at all which then moved behind our backyard tress, which they still were visible, the moved towards a cloud. The objects were visible for 30 seconds, and then it moved behind a cloud. The expectation of it following its direction was very high, because why would anyone expect anything else if it was an ���ordinary��� flying object. But as the expectation of it exiting the cloud was high, it never exited the cloud. I stared at the cloud as it moved away; making sure that it was not going to exit it. The clouds were about 500 ft above us moving swiftly across the sky in this chilly somewhat breezy night. If it was a bird that was as big as an SUV moving into a cloud, you would expect it to exit it, but it never did. My 16-year-old brother saw it but my youngest did not because of him needing new glasses. You would have to have your eyes adjusted to the night sky, and to have been on surveillance to see what we were seeing. From my first sighting to this second night sighting, everything happened in a synchronized fashion for it to be meaningful and it leaving out chance or a mistake of identity when pertaining to these objects. It was AMAZING. After my first sighting I started contacting news agencies in my local area and organizations that dealt with this stuff or not. I am 100% sure what I saw was ���out of this world��� and it happened twice to me; one night after the other. People that I have contacted have shunned me away, told me I did not see what I think I saw, and that they would call me back but never did. I don���t blame anyone not to look deep into it because how can anyone prove it happen, or didn���t. I went out the next night with my siblings and did not encounter the objects again, but I can feel this is not the end for my sightings. If they went through all that trouble to show themselves twice to me, which rarely happens to individuals that do see something like I have, then why not again another night? I don���t think of my self as special in anyway, but that these craft showed themselves to me where others have never seen one. Some will swear to have seen one and it ended up not being one, but all you have to do is talk to the eyewitness to understand the state of mind that they are in. So what I am purporting is that I am a reliable eyewitness to an event with a unique nature such as this one. If you don���t believe me, then just meet me. This life is interesting, and interesting things happen. I am just glad and honored that I got to see what most people have never seen, and enjoyed it with my brothers. I just feel that the last 2 days was a way of letting the world know through my 2 sightings that we are getting closer to the day where the boundaries that we have set for our own kind will be broken, and we will truly embrace freedom. This is just the beginning, and I am glad for it. My story, along with other stories of ufo���s is not a new one, but mine is a unique one that should definitely be looked into by people that have good intentions, and the resources to do it. But truly I don���t even think we have to go far anymore to get answers, because the answers to this mystery will be coming soon."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6882.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6882_submitter_file1__DesendsSouth.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6882_submitter_file2__West.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6882_submitter_file3__BehindCloud.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6882.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:07:30","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sanford","There was one other sighting in Sanford on or around April 22nd 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/22/2007 10:30 UTC","Latitude":"28.767472","City":"Sanford","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Stationary Flashing starlike object thousands of up then desends to earth 500 ft above us","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.767472,+-81.291709(6882)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6882) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/22/2007 10:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-81.291709","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","Case Number":"6882","Object Shape":"Oval"}
