{"Log Number":"US-04272010-0014","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI am compelled to tell all that I saw exactly what was described by a man in San Antonio and sent in to this site today. Around 8pm during one of the first days in March 2010, cannot recall exact date, I noticed three very very bright white lites, circular in shape, in the sky north of Hamilton Texas at about 45 degrees above horizon. They were moving SW to NE direction. They were moving along fairly fast, much the same speed as an army helicopter would be, BUT, these things were playing leap frog, in the blink of an eye, in a nano second, they would bounce up and over each other and change places, whilst all still moving in the same direction forward from left to right in the sky from my viewpoint. No known earthly manmade flying machine could have moved from one place to another in the sky like these things did. How big would they be you might ask ?? Judging from the distance they appeared to be up in the sky and all, could possibly been as big as a jumbojet. And they were literally changing places in the sky as fast as you can move your right hand over your left, so that your left hand is now on the right. Wish I knew what it was I saw !!"],"Date of the Event":"03/01/2010 08:00 UTC","Longitude":"-98.119533","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/27/2010 04:13 UTC","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Hamilton","There were no other sightings in Hamilton on or around March 1st 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.711496,+-98.119533(22996)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22996) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Other","Case Number":"22996","Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"3 bright circular white lites.","Region":"Texas","City":"Hamilton","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22996.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22996.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Latitude":"31.711496","Disposition":"Unknown"}
