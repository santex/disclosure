The disc was luminous and appeared to gleam and reflect and change in brightness as it swayed across the sky. Fell like a feather slowly, with control, bobbing up at times, and once to the treeline it slipped from sight for a second and then came back up and up and up swaying slightly and glowed. I watched it bob across the sky in the general vicinity of that area several times for a good minute before it disappeared. I knew it wasn't a plane because I could see other planes in the sky. There was no fog. I would be amazed if no one else reported it- I've never seen anything like it."]}
