Odd because it was a sustained bright orange light, with the absence of telltale blinking airplane lights. It stopped mid-sky and vanished. No slow dimming, just completely gone, as it the light was extinguished. There were no clouds in the sky to obscure the object. The obect arced, stopped then vanished.
