I stopped and looked at the Moon and the 2 Planets near it. When I noticed a dim light getting brighter and brighter. It looked like a fireball, but it didn't land, it was flying in a straight line opposite of the usual flight paths, because I live near the Ontario Airport. I went inside for 10 minutes, grabbed my cellphone and went back outside. That's when I saw the second one. I tried to take pictures, but none of the pictures came out. I did get video.
