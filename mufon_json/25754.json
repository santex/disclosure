I first noticed one of the lights and it appeared to be a planet since it was multicolored and twinkling. Then I noticed another identical light approximately 50-75 feet straight across from it in the sky. Between the two lights I then noticed three more identical lights evenly arranged in a straight line, perpendicular to the other two lights. The lights hovered over the town in the same tight pattern for roughly 15 minutes, before rising vertically at a moderate pace for five to ten seconds. After rising, all five lights simultaneously blinked out and I saw no other trace of the object. As I came back into the house, I noticed all of the dogital clocks in the house were flashing as if they had been reset, yet all of them were still plugged into the wall."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10092010-0003","Summary":"Multiple multicolored lights in a strange pattern hovering over city and then slowly rising and disappearing","City":"Providence","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Kentucky","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25754.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25754.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/09/2010 02:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Providence","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
