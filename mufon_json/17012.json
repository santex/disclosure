{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at home, looking up into the sky in the evening, and saw 4 white lights, quickly moving from south to north. I first noticed them when they were almost directly overhead, and lost sight of them when they reached the horizon, about 3 seconds later. The 4 lights appeared to be connected as one object; they were very close together, and in a row perpendicular to the direction of travel. There was no sound. They were moving much faster than satellites appear to be moving. They were unlike any airplanes I have seen (moving too quickly; no sound; traveling in an unusual direction for the area). I would like to know how to find out what it might have been."],"Latitude":"42.988338","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"4 white lights abreast, traveling as a unit, going north.","Log Number":"CA-05192009-0019","Date Submitted":"05/19/2009 10:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Ontario","Longitude":"-81.240138","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"17012","trends":["There have been 32 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around May 19th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"05/19/2009 10:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","City":"London","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17012.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17012.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.988338,+-81.240138(17012)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17012) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
