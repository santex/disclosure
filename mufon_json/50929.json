What caught my eye first was the lack if navigation lites but on further observation I noticed 4 lights with a white-green glow on the end of the craft facing east as the craft flew to the west. I called out to my wife who came by my side as I pointed out the lights to her , the craft continued on its path west and upwards until we could no longer see it. Very exciting to see another unknown craft. I look into the nite sky a lot after seeing my first craft nearly 40 years ago!!"],"Log Number":"US-09202013-0015","Case Number":"50929","trends":[],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"35.522241"}
