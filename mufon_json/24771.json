Thought it was a bird at first but it was moving too quickly and there did not seem to be any wing movement. Noticed it disappeared into rain clouds and then reappeared seconds later. Then two more objects appeared. Thought maybe planes but one object completed a full cirlce in a very short radius. Judging by height and speed and path of travel this was niether bird nor plane. Watched objects move quickly and smoothly through sky in and out of clouds for about five minutes. Not thinking to get a camera.....duh. Then objects disappeared above clouds not to return. You tell me."],"Summary":"Looked like birds at first.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.046074","Log Number":"US-07262010-0013","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"North Port","Date of the Event":"07/26/2010 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in North Port","There were no other sightings in North Port on or around July 26th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Date Submitted":"07/26/2010 07:48 UTC","Case Number":"24771","Longitude":"-82.230745","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24771.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24771.html"]}
