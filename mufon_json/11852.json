I immediatly ran inside and grabbed my binoculars and found the object at a very high altitude moving very quickly accross the cloudless sky. I first spotted the object when it was passing by venus and had a spooky feeling about what I saw. It had a luminous green glow that made it seem bommerrang'ish without binoculars but when looking through the specs multicolored lights were revolving around it consistantly never stopping and the \"green\" glow was still there only brighter. I dont know if my neighbors took any pictures or not because I didnt. I was to caught up in what I was seeing and am wondering if there is going to be any other witnesses"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"46.004929","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/31/2008 10:35 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08012008-0002","Summary":"Heard neighbors talking about an object in the sky and went to look out of curiosity","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11852.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11852.html"],"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Butte","There were no other sightings in Butte on or around July 31st 2008"],"City":"Butte","Case Number":"11852","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.004929,+-112.605438(11852)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11852) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
