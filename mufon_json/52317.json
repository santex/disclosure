I pull out my Bin I had that was 1000 yds. I was telling my wife this is strange but as I was looking at it was so bright it was in the L shape and I could see the stars in the back ground but this object was bigger than the stars, after a hour it seem to fade away I was going to use my camera but it was a 10x I never took a picture of it so I apology I have never saw something like this before, I wonder if anybody else seen what I saw last night."]}
