{"Object Shape":"Disc","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn Feb 12 2012 at approx 11:20 am my 10 year old daughter caught a snapshot of a ufo up close. The photo was taken between Richmond Tx and Wharton Tx. My 10 year old daughter was taking pictures with her camera and I told her to stop because the clicking from the camera was well you know. Anyhow she stoped and when she went scrolling through the pictures she yelled and started to cry because she was terrified at what she saw. I immediatley looked and was astonished by what she had came across it took me a couple a days to sink in what was captured. So now I just build enough courage to share this amazing close up photo with the world. I do have to original photo and storage disk available."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"35827","City":"Wharton","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35827.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35827_submitter_file1__158.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35827.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/15/2012 11:06 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"10 year old daught Caught close up photo with camera","Object Features":"Dome","Log Number":"US-02152012-0007","Longitude":"-96.094217","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Wharton","There was one other sighting in Wharton on or around February 12th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.332966,+-96.094217(35827)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35827) map </A>","Latitude":"29.332966","Date of the Event":"02/12/2012 11:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
