I looked up at the sky as I so often do. I saw a bright orange light high up in the sky(about the size of venus to the naked eye) for about 6 seconds, it appeared to be stationary and then the light went out. I could just see a spec of light remaining where the orange light had been which appeared to move but then I couldn't keep track of it because it was so small. I thought it could have been a satelite reflecting the sun but I'm not sure. This is my 4th UFO sighting in ten years however each event has been entirely different."],"Date Submitted":"05/17/2009 11:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.92959,+-1.471449(17040)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17040) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"GB-05212009-0003","Summary":"Bright orange light, looked very high up but remained still.
