We were watching the full moon in the clear sky at about 9:20pm. Suddenly, a bright orange spherical object appeared in the sky to the right of the moon. The object would grow and shrink. It looked like Jupiter does in the night sky only orange. It would also stop and hover, and then move and stop again, while changing shape. The object continued until it located itself underneath a star. Then, it seemed to disappear within itself."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37163.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37163_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37163.html"]}
