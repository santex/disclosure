We looked up and I saw what looked to be a stealth bomber at first but did not have the staggered tail. Just straight across with a slot in the back. You can tell it was huge by the outline and as many stars it covered while it was moving. We were all asking each other what that was. No one knew. Didnt make any sound and didnt have any lights. We talked about it all night until my wife got sick of hearing about it."],"Date Submitted":"08/13/2013 01:10 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Wings","Summary":"Large Triangle Craft, no lights, no sound.","Region":"Connecticut","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-73.028123","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Waterbury","Log Number":"US-08132013-0013","Latitude":"41.578231","Case Number":"49797","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.578231,+-73.028123(49797)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49797) map </A>","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Waterbury","There were no other sightings in Waterbury on or around August 12th 2013"]}
