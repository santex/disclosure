I was on a service call about 8:30PM in June. I saw what looked like a fire ball over White Lake. It didn't move and I watched it on my way home It didn't move and stayed in about the smae place for about an hr.. It finely just looked like it just got smaller and disapeared. It might have droped in to the lake at that point I don't know? I wish I had told some one then, but In those days you didn't want to seam like you were crazy. If you want to call me I could take you to the place were I saw it so many years ago. Thanks Gene PS.
