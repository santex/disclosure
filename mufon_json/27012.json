I pulled over on the offramp which leads to coverdale road and continued watching it . It had no blinking lights at all and when it passed me i could see the back of it and it glowed a redish orange colour. It was not going very fast and from the side I could barely see it but when it passed it was quite visible. If anyone else saw it please contact me.
