I heard a kind of pulsating hum. I looked up and saw a spherical object in the sky at about 2,000 feet? At first I thought it was an helicopter, but it just stayed there for at least 2 minutes ( I timed it after about 15 seconds becuase it was so unusual) and then it just flew straight up and out of sight in about 3 seconds."],"Summary":"An object appeared in the sky - hovered for about 2 1/2 minutes and left.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
