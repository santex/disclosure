As I was going on the path, I looked to my right, the east, and in the sky there was a cigar shaped UFO. And I could not stare at it because other people were using the bike path, and I wanted to win for my team. But when I did look back, it wasn't there, and it was all the way on the West part of the sky. Then it vanished. It actually seemed like it sped away, as opposed to dissapearing. But whatever it did, it was fast. I k now it was not a plane, for a fact. And it was not moving, it was stationary, but when I looked back, it obviously moved very fast to the west half of the sky. I was kind of frightened, but at the same time I was intrigued."],"Longitude":"-82.900493","Tags":"City","trends":[""],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.426357","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/18/2010 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.426357,+-82.900493(25128)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25128) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/18/2010 05:49 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed"}
