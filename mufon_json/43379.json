At first i thought it was the black helicopter circling around the estate but it was silent and then i realised what it was and then i thought: i need to get a pictuure of it I tried to slide to unlock but the screen kept going offi managed to budge it but my hands wear numb from shock and then i got it to just unlock and just took the picture. I felt like the air was heaving on me as i stared at it and i felt numb and weak but i just stood there like i needed to revise what was happening. I noticed it had been moving upwardsfrom the distance of the tree edge, and itjust suddenly swooped up like it was a elevater shaftgoing up a inisible tube. after that i had the worlds biggest head ache."],"Latitude":"59.13131","Case Number":"43379"}
