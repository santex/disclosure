At first I thought they were two stars. While I watched one of the lights disappeared, then reappeared as two lights, red and green. After getting my wife, we saw the other light go out and reappear as two lights,red and green. We thought they were probably helicopters. my son then joined us. The lights moved to the right (west) extremely fast, and separated farther apart. they then stopped and one set of lights moved southeast extremely fast.(there were at least 5 aircraft visible in the night sky and the lights were moving at least 4 or five times as fast as any of the other aircraft). The other set of lights basically \"streaked\" east fast enough to catch up with the first set of lights. The lights continued southeast maintaining a uniform distance apart until they were out of sight to the southeast."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45706.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45706.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/14/2013 11:48 UTC","Log Number":"US-02142013-0009","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Latitude":"33.664282"}
