{"divs":["sighting detailsi was visiting someone's backyard, enjoying a nice camp fire with three others when something got my attention. i looked up to see this reddish\\pink light orb glowing quite largely in the sky. it was beautiful, couldn't take my eyes off of it as it seemed like pure light shining brightly in the night sky. i did not know what it was, but it felt like brilliant pure love. it looked like a single firework lit up, only it held its perfectly circular orb-like form and was consistently glowing its warm radiant light as if it were a living photograph. i felt like it had its own consciousness and was communicating on a higher level. i wanted to let my partner who was sitting right next to me know but for some reason i felt like it was there to communicate with me. the lights within were perfectly dispersed to form its sphere with a main bright reddish light as its core. the light was slightly transparent when i first noticed it in its expanded form. it hovered there for a few minutes as i was in complete amazement, then it became condensed, (a little bigger than a planet and glowing reddish) as it travelled across the sky beyond the trees in the distance."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.330741,+-122.198007(35910)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35910) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02182012-0009","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Auburn","Case Number":"35910","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35910.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35910.html"],"Region":"Washington","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Auburn","There were no other sightings in Auburn on or around October 3rd 2009"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"47.330741","Summary":"Reddish/Pink orb sighted hovering and expanded in form, became star-sized then travelled southwest from the sighted location","Date Submitted":"02/18/2012 02:40 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/03/2009 10:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-122.198007"}
