There were 4 of us including me. Saw ufos before so I like looking up at the stars. 3 of my friends were talking when I noticed something. This looked like a ufo ive seen before so I decided to get my friends attention. of the 4 1.5 was skeptic. 1 was skeptic the other was skeptic but open to the idea. To get there attention I pointed and said \" Thats plane is moving fast.\" They looked up because the object was kinda traveling fast. \"Yah its a plane... its a plane... its a plane ohhhhh thats not a plane. The object was traveling horizontally across the skies when it suddenly shot up. Like how you shoot a roman candle up in the air. The object was gone. That was cool never seen it like that before."],"Date of the Event":"02/02/2012 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"48071","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
