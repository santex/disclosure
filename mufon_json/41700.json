It was moving far to erratically to be an airplane, so I kept my eye on it. It was moving all over the place but keeping around the same area going in a path seemingly in our direction. It would go fast at times and then just hover at others. But one thing for sure, it would not stay still a friend of mine compared its motions to a bumblebee. I felt entranced by the object being the first time i saw something like it before. The only reason I lost track of it was due to the cloud coverage. And like I said, last I saw it appeared to be heading south."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sebring","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.922836,+-81.018982(41700)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41700) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"04:00:00","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"41700","Log Number":"US-08132012-0008","Date Submitted":"08/13/2012 03:41 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
