It didn't surprise me since there'd been so much talk with all the recent sightings. They were just hovering, and it was a clear glimpse I got, too. I don't question that they were UFOs, I KNOW that they were. I know exactly what I saw. I ended up just going about my business at the pharmacy and have never really spoken of the incident in fear of being deemed \"crazy.\" Notice, I chose to remain anonymous! That's because I still have that fear of being deemed \"crazy.\""],"Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20511.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20511.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Three Flying Saucers"}
