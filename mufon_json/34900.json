It was brighter than any stars or planes in the area. I called my wife and we watched it for about 10 minutes before grabbing our cameras. We ended up watching the object and taking pictures for about 40 minutes or so. We live close to the ATL international airport and several times planes were pretty close to the object. After looking at our pictures and video we noticed the object was disc shaped. At the time the object appeared to change shape. Around 7:40pm the object dimmed and slowly moved out of site. It was a very interesting experience. We aren���t sure what we saw��� We love going to air shows and are used to the air traffic in the area. This was definitely out of the ordinary. I used a Canon 50D and my wife used a Nikon D90"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Longitude":"-84.555341","Case Number":"34900","City":"Tyrone","Date of the Event":"01/15/2011 07:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Disc like object observed in the sky for about 40 minutes before dimming and leaving the distance.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.487109,+-84.555341(34900)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34900) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Tyrone","There was one other sighting in Tyrone on or around January 15th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34900.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34900_submitter_file1__9411-ufo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34900_submitter_file2__IMG_9398.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34900_submitter_file3__91417-ufoandsnip.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34900.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Country":"United States"}
