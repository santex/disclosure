{"divs":["Sighting Detailsa friend and i were traveling in co hwy 41 towards leeds to take some people home after the public fireworks show at the oak mountian amp.theater.its a large show with 2 other locations doing the same thing at the same to a radio broadcast. it was ling after the show around 10:30pm when i decided to ask my friend if its ok to smoke a cig in his car.as i crack the window i notice in the front right of the windshield that there's an orange glowing object above the mountian and as i look at my friend i tell him hay check it out.he looks at me and says oh thats just the reflection of your cig in the windshield and then i proceed to throw my cig out and tell him to look now.in amazement he decides to pull over and we get out of the car and watch as this thing as best as i can describe begins to acsend and decend and also move from right to left 200 to 300 feet above the mountian pulsating. then it begins to change shapes from teardrop to oval to well as i can best describe it looked like the oil in a lava lamp.almost like it was on fire but not.like it was splitting and reconnecting back together glowing the same color as a sunset. to say the least it was breathtaking.so as o try to come to terms with what happened \"come out of shock\" the object begins to ascend to about 500 feet and then vanashes.but like it was in slow motion in the same spot in the sky and faded like when a candle burns itself out.it seems like it took forever.so we take our friends to the meeting place to drop them off and then we head back towards hwy 280 when my friend notices before me that that object is on the other side of the county road in a field doing the same lava lamp thing it was before but just above groung level maybe 15feet from the ground and as he tries to pull over it dissappears but not like before it was quick like snap of a finger gone.when we got to my parents home in indian springs (about 10 or 12 miles away)and began to tell my mother and father what had happened.and in doing so my mother had mentioned she had seen something in the 60's in the sky here that made the news but it was reported to be a weather baloon over birmingham.she had given a very similar discription of what she saw so i was wondering if anybody in this area saw the same thing.or maybe someone has seen the same thing or has footage or photos of the object that would help me prove me and my friend are not crazy!!!!thanx for reading"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Chelsea","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25003.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25003.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.340111,+-86.630262(25003)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25003) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Lava lamp in the sky on the Fourth of July, 1997.","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Alabama","Log Number":"US-08072010-0024","Latitude":"33.340111","City":"Chelsea","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"08/07/2010 08:27 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Star-like, Teardrop, Other, Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/1997 10:25 UTC","Longitude":"-86.630262","Case Number":"25003"}
