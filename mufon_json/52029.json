{"Log Number":"GB-11042013-0011","Country":"United Kingdom","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had just opened the back door to throw some rubbish into the dustbin when I saw what I thought was a rocket (Guy Fawkes) but it looked like it was getting higher and higher (to high) which made me watch it for longer.I then realised that it was something coming from the West but after about 10 seconds or maybe a bit more it started to dim down as it got closer until it totally dimmed just before it got to being almost overhead in just the same way the ISS does when going into the earths shadow. It was as best as I could tell going at about the same speed as the ISS. The most striking thing was that it most certainly looked like a rocket with a trail of what certainly looked like fire.
