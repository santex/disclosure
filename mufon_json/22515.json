I looked up to the sky and saw about 6 fireballs in formation of a boomerang that dissappeared and reappeared. in all there were 7 witnesses. I was in so much shock that i didnt remember that my camera was in the car! Im not sure that the date i wrote down was corrected but i am positive that it was a UFO!I know that about a month before this sighting he had seen the same thing but it was a lime glowing light. We live right by the bay and thats where the sightings have happened. I find myself searching the skies everyday since.I lost sight of it when it completely dissapeared. Weirdest thing was that we liv next to a airbase and approx. 10 min after the sighting we heard that the jet planes were set out. 25 min later we saw a object flying really high flying quickly in the dark sky then it stopped for a split second then it zoomed by so fast."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Fireball, Teardrop","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"03/27/2010 10:21 UTC","Longitude":"-74.414777","Object Features":"None","Region":"New Jersey","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.373383,+-74.414777(22515)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22515) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"22515","Latitude":"39.373383","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22515.html"]}
