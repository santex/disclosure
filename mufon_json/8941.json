It was in the southern sky, just sitting motionless. At that distance in the sky (it was up in the sky, not at the horizon) it looked like a solid red, but it was \"twinkling\". I watched it for 10 minutes while driving home. When I looked away for a while, then looked back up, it was gone. It was not a plane: it did not move in a pattern like a plane, it did not have the white and red blinking landing lights, it never came in closer than where it sat for a touchdown (Note: I go by DFW Airport every day and watch the planes coming in for landings) and it was round. It was not a planet: it was too big, too brilliant and the wrong color red. It never moved the entire time I watched it. It was stationary. I did not think anything about it until I heard about the Stephanville sightings (and other sightings at surrounding communities). I felt I should report this sighting as it was close enough to those communities to be related."],"Date Submitted":"01/09/2008 06:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around January 9th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8941.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8941.html"],"Case Number":"8941","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States"}
