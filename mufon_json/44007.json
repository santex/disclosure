As they came closer they began to blink out one at a time. She indicated that the lights were constant- no flickering or flashing. She called me on a cell phone and asked me ifI could see them was well, as we live close to where she was driving. I went outside and looked towards the north and saw two orange-red pinpoints low in the sky, just above the horizon through some trees. The objects were a saturated orange-red, similar to the color of a neon bulb. My view of them was partially obscured by the trees but when visible they seemed bright and steady to me as well. As they drifted east I finally lost them in the trees. They were visible to me for approximately 10-15 seconds."],"Date Submitted":"11/18/2012 08:57 UTC","Case Number":"44007","City":"Hanover Park","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.019432,+-88.126882(44007)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44007) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44007.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44007.html"],"Longitude":"-88.126882","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hanover Park","There were no other sightings in Hanover Park on or around November 18th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Circle"}
