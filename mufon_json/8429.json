i currently live in las vegas nv, my story began in lompoc california near vandenberg afb. i believe i was 8 years old because i was in the 3rd grade so this was 1974 i believe. my oldest sister linda had recently had been married and i inherited her room, i had bunk beds in my old room but this room was bigger so my bunk beds where broke down into 2 beds one on each side of my room. i remember quite vividly the bed covers on the beds my mom made them, they had ww1 era airplanes on them. i don���t remember how long i had been in this room when i had this encounter. on this particular night i slept in the bed near the window as i slept in which ever bed struck my fancy that night. i remember waking from a deep sleep in the middle of the night, i turned my head towards the window and standing there outside my window as clear as day staring me in the face is what i know now as a \"grey alien\" and mind you this is several years before close encounters of a 3rd kind was released (not that i would have been able to watch it my mom never would have let me see that kind of movie back then) i remember it as if it was yesterday it was so clear he was looking right at me in the face, i remember big black eyes with a bald brow crunched up like it had a scowl on its face, with it's head tilted to one side. i rolled out of bed crawled across my floor opened the door and ran into my parents room where i announced i would never go in my room again because there is a monster outside my window! i did not sleep in my room for weeks until my father had enough and insisted i sleep in my own room. this could be blown off as just a bad dream or an over active imagination as my parents tried to do. but i suffered from what i know now as post traumatic syndrome for several years with very livid extreme night terrors and very strange sleep walking events that lasted well into my teenage years, not to mention i did not sleep anywhere near a window until i was married when i was 21. this event changed my life i never felt safe after this in my own room and once in awhile i will have a panic attack at night and have no idea why, i do not think more than a few days have ever past that i have not thought about that night 33 ago. the second event happened around 10 years ago. i had recently gone through a bad divorce and had lost a house to forcloser, me and a friend where crashing at his uncles house and had just started a new job. on this particular night the old house we where staying was hot (summer in vegas with no ac on) so i elected to sleep in the back yard in a lawn chair. this is where it gets a lil foggy i do not know if i fell asleep. but all i remember is standing in the middle of the back yard and i am looking at a glowing orange ufo disk shape (i see these described as a plasma ufo) slowly flying over my head and of to the north, it made no sound and it was only maybe 100-150 feet of the ground. i remember i was not exited it gave me a feeling of being very uneasy not exited like you would imagine i watched it slowly fly away at maybe 40 miles an hour. i went into the house and watched t.v. until my friend woke. i did not tell him for a few days, i am not sure why. the events i have reported here are true i in no way seek anything, or any attention. both these events have rocked my very core beliefs, as i get older i for some reason have been thinking more of these events and want to know why i have seen both an alien and such a clear ufo. if you tell someone you have had more than one alien\\ufo experience it completely changes the way they look at you. i no longer talk about this to my family because it upsets my oldest daughter. i have spent many years wondering about what i seen, i don���t know if they come from another planet or if that kind of travel is even possible. i am sharing these events in this forum so maybe i can understand and maybe help someone else understand what we are seeing. best regards steven b."],"Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8429.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8429.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around June 20th 1997"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Las Vegas","Latitude":"36.115946","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Nevada","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-115.165016","Case Number":"8429","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"06/20/1997 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-11222007-0006","Date of the Event":"06/20/1997 12:00 UTC"}
