My children and I was just driving up to the house getting out of the car. As I looked east I saw this object, flying just above the treetops at very close range. I yelled for the children to get the binoculars. It was app. 300 feet coming towards us. As it got to the rr. tracks. As it was nearing the tracks it made a very sharp turn, flying over the tracks north toward Jackson. I ran toward the tracks and about that time there was another one, which followed the first. They were moving very slowly. I watched until they were out of sight. starting back toward the house I heard a small jet plane which was apparently following the objects. It couldn't make that kind of turn so it continued down the road by my house. The objects made no noise whatsoever.It's hard for anyone to believe if they have never seen one. Because I would have had trouble believing if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"32.300127","Case Number":"11072","City":"Jackson","Region":"Mississippi","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11072.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11072.html"],"Summary":"round with colored lights, moving just above the tree tops making no noise.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.300127,+-90.18314(11072)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11072) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/05/1972 12:00 UTC"}
