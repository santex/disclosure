Lights blip in and out and move, but at about 2.5 of the movie a fiery disc flashes across the right of my lens. Video at start has a light blinking white to red in the middle of frame, and then a fiery disc with a 'tail' cuts in on the right, turns and exits right. there is then far away movement in the upper right, then center, and upper center left of the frame and object seems to dip in, then up and out. I will say that I felt compelled in some way to get out and start shooting, not something I normally do."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20737.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20737.html"],"Latitude":"39.73928","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11262009-0008","Tags":"City","Case Number":"20737","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"fat double-row clouds, lights blink white to red, then a disc flashes across the right of frame. didn't see it till next day, suprised me.
