{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI walked out of my local video store Family Video. After noticing star directly in front of me I proceeded to take a photograph of it. I took two separate pictures to try and get the star in the best possible focus. Days past before I looked back over the photograph I noticed the object in both pictures. In the first photo the lights appear white and in the latter they appear to be red. There were no airplanes, helicopters, weather-ballons and no noise coming from the object. Local mild traffic with nothing out of the ordinary. Looking at the lights and slots so I doubted that it was a drone or any such vehicle. I would like the photograph to be confirmed by others to verify it not being something long the lines of a glare or ballon. I do believe it to be an ufo or something other-worldly."],"Region":"North Carolina","Case Number":"52291","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","Latitude":"35.766353","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","City":"Hickory","Date of the Event":"11/03/2013 06:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52291.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52291.html"],"trends":["There have been 33 other sightings in Hickory","There were no other sightings in Hickory on or around November 3rd 2013"],"Date Submitted":"11/19/2013 01:21 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-81.301046","Summary":"took photos of star in background. later saw object in photo.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.766353,+-81.301046(52291)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52291) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11192013-0001","Tags":"City"}
