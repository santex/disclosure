{"Summary":"Three days of sightings this week","divs":["sighting detailsi've been watching the skies for years and seen many things, last winter while pulling in my drive way i witnesses in the north sky a star like (very bright white light) do a high velocity vertical descend, i searched the report sites that night and for days without seeing any postings of the incident, two nights ago while sitting in my back yard sky watching i had my neighbor come by and he started asking me why i had the binoculars with me, i told him of the years of sightings and many explained and unexplained things i've seen, at that point i glance to my right (i had turned my torso due west to speak to my neighbor) 10��� n x nw and see a bright star like object on a steady path heading s.e at approx. 500 asl (above sea level) much lower than a star right?, i reached for my binoculars while telling my neighbor that this is the reason for them, i noticed and later found out that my girlfriend was watching it for about 15 seconds before me and she said it flashed in as she was watching the sky, i have a very good pair of steiner commanders 7 x 50 binocular military grade, with the binoculars i could zoom and focus before it was directly in front of me (facing true north) it traversed the sky slowly and silent and would slightly shift from an east trajectory to a south east trajectory, i handed the binoculars to my girlfriend and then my neighbor who was speechless. all we saw was an extremely white starburst no faa aircraft strobes or red, green and yellow white safety lights. i was the last person to watch it as it disappeared in the eastern sky by fading out. we ( my girlfriend and i ) have seen this from two other different in town locations and different trajectories since then, i believe that this area has a very large amount of un identified air craft traffic being very close to a large commercial airport and most people being pre occupied with the traffic on the streets and not watching the sky. i've witnessed spheres as large as a small suv flying in tandem between houses to flying in formation while splitting up and going in separate directions and against the wind. some of these sightings have been witnessed by people who have been sitting with me while watching our skies. my feelings and of those with me during this particular sighting where stable no anxiety at least none admitted speaking for my self i have no problems with these sightings or what they may be, i understand the government's stand and why and look at all of the sightings objectably i know many types of aircraft commercial, private and military, i understand logistics and i'm a high tech professional. the only time i felt anything was when two suv sized spheres\\orbs flew over my head about 106 asl in tandem during a late winter 7 years ago at the same location..... thanks and watch our\\your skies."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.665052","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/05/2008 08:45 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"11999","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/05/2008 08:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-74.205691","Region":"New Jersey","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.665052,+-74.205691(11999)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11999) map </A>","Object Shape":"Egg, Sphere, Other, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Elizabeth","There were no other sightings in Elizabeth on or around August 5th 2008"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08092008-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11999.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11999.html"],"City":"Elizabeth"}
