It looked like a trace made by little shiny stars vanishing. The object appeard from out of nothing, and disappeared from out of nothing, in the sky not very far from me. It flew in horizontal direction. It couldn't have been a plane, a balloon or fireworks. The speed, light intensity and traject are not compatible with any object here, specially because it appeared and disappreared in the clear sky. It couldn't have been a falling star as well, it was too close to here, and it wasn't falling, it was flying. I saw other spaceships before, I can descrbe them in details if you want. They were very close to me. The first was hovering less than 50 meters away. I was looking at it from the 8th floor apt window with my brother. We were kids but we know what we saw. Not a long time after that, I saw another object flying over my buildng. I was alone and I still ask myself if I really saw it. I'd like to know about dreams..."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-23.548943,+-46.638818(7083)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7083) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Log Number":"BR-05232007-0004"}
