Then the light started to faint - object was oval shaped from my point of view (its hard to tell)its colour was maybe gray.The object was approx. 5km away. And then suddenly this object changed its way. I tought it went north but it seems it did the opposite. It happened so fast I just couldnt realize - it was gone. I was driving my car and I managed to snap 2 photos durin the event. I drove alone. I just happened to have my phone at hand when all this happened. And luckily I just did wash my car so that windshield was clean! And what made feel uncertain about all this is that in the photos there is two objects - I only saw one. I would like to remain anonymous Sincerely, Mr. P"],"Log Number":"FI-01082007-0003","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Kymenlaakso","Object Features":"Other","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder, Disc, Fireball, Unknown","Latitude":"60.832959","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"26.723506","Source":"MUFON","City":"Kouvola","Tags":"City"}
