We have a window that faces the south the blind was up and the window was open.A bright orange light just above the tree line caught my attention i watched it for about ten seconds and it dissapered ijust kept watching all of a sudden it appeared higher in the sky.That got me off the couch i went to the window and watched it was like someone shut off a light switch and it was gone.By this time i am thinking that this did not look like a plane light or a star. i then went outside and stood out there for about 10 minutes at this time my girlfreind who had been watching tv in the bedroom came to the door and asked what i was doing when i told her she laughed and said get in the house.I walked up on the deck and looked to my right there it was again i yelled debbie hurry there it is she got there in time to see it before it dissapeared when it did another one came on.we both stood there watching and then it dissapered my girlfreind acted a little uneasy after she witnesed this and went back in the house i stayed out there about 5 more minutes but i didnt see anything more when i went in i asked her what she thought she just said probably some kind of plane i said not like any plane lights i have ever seen and not a planet they dont turn off and appear in othe parts of the sky"]}
