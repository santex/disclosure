Just used to lookling up when airplanes fly by but this this was turning at 90 degrees every turn it took. and it crossed the horizon from east to north west in like 2 to 3 mins! Never seen something move so fast and take such turns. this event happened ages back. but its a vision i can never erase from my mind.
