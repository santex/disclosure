As I sat there I look at the night sky in an easterly direction.I noticed two airliners in the sky at that time, one in the northeast sky and the other in the southeast sky.At this time I saw what looked like three lights in a triangle formation across the sky from the east.Then the lights started to move around each other in a clockwise direction. At the same time the three lights started to move to the north very fast and very high out of my sight. This all took place in around 30 seconds.I was very excited about the whole thing.it covered the entire sky within my view in less than half a minute, thats got to be moving very fast."],"Latitude":"42.492764","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Waterloo","There were no other sightings in Waterloo on or around April 4th 2006"]}
