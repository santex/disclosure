I was standing in the driveway. I did glance up and saw a group of lights to the south. They were heading to the SE. There was no particular formation. I was waiting for a sound because I live near Camp Lejeune and New River Air Station. There was no sound. There were no aircraft prior to or afterwards. Some of the lights went to the north and some went to the south, while some continued on the same SE path.I lost sight of them beyond the trees. I was curious and thought it was odd due to the lack of noise due to the speed they were moving. I looked and listened for a few minutes, but saw nothing else. I called the dogs in."]}
