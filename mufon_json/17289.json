Last night this bright flash came out of nowhere in the backyard on the house. Laye on my back on the tanning chair in the middle of the night one fly by and turn off its lights right when it hit the tree to the left, this happens everynight. Then another flashed its lights. Sometimes I wonder if they are humans like Jesus or something or they are aliens. All I think about now is Jesus and Mary. I dont know why they are here everynight or what they want but activity is slowly increasing and my mom and dad dont believe me and act afraid of me when I am so afraid to even go out in public or talk to anyone. Last night was like my 200th UFO sighting in 4 years. Much love and respect"],"Log Number":"US-06012009-0009","Latitude":"41.919991"}
