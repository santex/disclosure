Vallarta, second floor. One night we noticed this flashing light, way up in the sky. It was moving, but staying stationary in it's place.. I got the video camera and when I was able to 'close up' on it, it looked almost like a strange energy force, multi-colored and moving very rapidly, but staying in the same spot. Almost like a squiggly line moving in every direction and changing color. I've never seen anything like it. It stayed there for hours, then it would disappear for a while, then reappear. It wasn't there every night, but did come and go over a period of a few weeks. Then, we never saw it again. I have hours of video footage of it. The video is on a MiniDV8 tape. I could send it to you but I want it back of course. Let me know."],"Longitude":"-105.219917","Country":"Mexico","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Other, Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/15/2005 09:00 UTC"}
