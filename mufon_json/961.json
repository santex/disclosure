It wouldhave appeared to have been an airplane or such, except for the fact that it wasgoing straight down at rapid speed and then disappeared. The speed wasdefinitely more than an object would normally fall at. It is because of thisspeed and the fact that it was directly in front of us and we did not see theobject go up before coming down that we knew it cannot have been a firework orground-launched incendiary device. It was far enough that we do not know if itmade sound, yet close enough that we looked down a few streets to see if wecould see it where it may have landed. Witness 2 believes it landed, and quitepossibly the light went out just before landing. Witness 1 believes itdisappeared from view - perhaps the light went out but it was still there.Shortly thereafter (no more than 5 minutes) 3 or 4 helicopters were circling theneighborhood."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/961.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/961.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.700934,+-73.462068(961)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (961) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"961","Longitude":"-73.462068","City":"North Massapequa","Date Submitted":"12/02/2000 11:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Bright green light ball falling from sky at accele","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/02/2000 11:15 UTC","Log Number":"","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
