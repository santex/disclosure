We live in a very rural area, so it was very dark with a nice starfield. I happened to be looking in the right place at the right time. Two yellow lights faded in in the northeastern sky, one just a little brighter than the other. I thought it might be an airplane at first, but I've never seen any airplane with yellow lights. They moved slowly, headed south, and were visible for about 30 seconds until they faded back out like they were never there."],"Date Submitted":"11/14/2009 11:07 UTC"}
