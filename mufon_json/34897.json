{"Summary":"observed a bright orange/yellow shining straight down to the ground, could not see to the top.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01162012-0011","divs":["sighting details in 1978 i lived in a duplex in stevensville, michigan. i lived a quarter mile form the cook nuclear power plant. one night while watching tv, i got up to get something to drink and noticed a really bright light outside in the backyard. we had a sliding glass door that lead out back. i opened the door and went out to find out where the light was coming from. outside to my left i saw a bright yellow\\orange beam of light shining to the ground. i looked up to see where it was coming from and could not see to the top and i did not hear any sound from it. at this point i felt a sense of fear and went back inside. my girlfriend at that time worked at the power plant as a security guard. the next morning she came home and asked me to guess what she and others had seen at the power plant. she was shocked when i replied, a ufo. then i told her what i had seen. the next day when her son and daughter came home after staying in battle creek for the weekend. i told them what i seen and they did,nt believe me, so i took them to the bottom of the hill and to the left where the bottom of the light was shining. when we got there, we noticed that the weeds that were around 4ft high were laid flat in about a 12ft.round area. not burned, just laid flat. on the way back to the house i noticed there were two small steams between the house and the highway. the one closest to the house had what looked like gas on top of the water, and the one closest to the highway was clear. the strangest thing living there were our neighbors. they had two small children ages from three to five. the walls between our duplexes were thin, and in the year we lived there we never heard the children, laugh or cry or anything. i never spoke to the man, but i did speak to the woman on one occasion. she seemed very pleasant and nice, but at the same time had air about her that seemed very distant and cold. kind of what it would feel like talking to an android, and no i don't think she was an android, but the feeling was so strange and i have never forgot it. if you are wondering why i am writing about this now, i was talking with a friend the other day and the subject came up and my friend said i should contact mufon so i did. this sighting was also reported in the local news papers and other witnesses that worked at the cook nuclear power plant."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34897.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34897.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.022247,+-86.515495(34897)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34897) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.515495","Date of the Event":"09/16/1978 11:17 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Stevensville","There were no other sightings in Stevensville on or around September 16th 1978"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.022247","Case Number":"34897","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Stevensville","Date Submitted":"01/16/2012 05:41 UTC"}
