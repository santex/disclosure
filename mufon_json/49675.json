I could see them pass between a house and a line of trees about 50 yards away. Impossible to tell how far away they were. They kept coming, passing behind the line of trees. I estimate 50 - 100 or more passed by in about ten minutes. They were not in a formation, just randomly passing by. After about ten minutes there were no more. I had no idea what they could be. I was not afraid, just amazed and curious."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08102013-0014","Date of the Event":"08/09/2013 11:10 UTC","Region":"Massachusetts","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.760498,+-71.079066(49675)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49675) map </A>"}
