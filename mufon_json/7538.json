yes! i did.\" and i said \"no\" the craft. she said, \"what craft\" and i pointed into the sky just about the buildings and said \"there\", \"do you see it\" its a ufo. just then she grabbed on to my arm and said \"oh my god, what is that??\", all i could say was that i didn't know. it then shot another fireball at the ground and we both jumped in fear. i asked if she saw that and she stated yes. i asked her if she saw what i was seeing floating above the buildings and she said \"yes, i see it...what is it?\" all i could say at that time was \"it's some kind of space ship.\" oh my god what were we looking at?? i\\we had never seen anything like it before in our lives. just then while we were staring at the craft, it started to move toward the road that came to the guard shack at the warehouse. i said to her, \"it's starting to move, do you see it?\" yes! was the response. it started to slowly move in a southernly direction, when it got to the road we were both frozen in fear and shock and disbelief. just as it reached the road it turned westerly toward us and started coming right at us. it was so low that i could of hit it with a rock...it traveled toward us and my wife started to panic and i told her to stand still and don't move. she was so scared...and was grabbing on to me really hard. as it headed toward us i became aware that there was no noise what so ever...it was absolutely quite. everything started to go into slow motion at this point, and i remember looking over to the guard shack to see if the guard was seeing this and he was in his booth with the door closed and the light on. it was only moving about 1 mile an hour if that, and it continued on toward us. as we stood there in disbelief and amazement it flew directly over the top of us...no lights, solid black and amazingly quite. i could not see any windows or landing gear or engines or anything...i remember thinking that i was just frozen stiff and didn't understand why. i considered yelling at it and decided against it...didn't want to make them mad or something i guess. it flew over our heads and flew down over the fence line of the warehouse. it seems like it got to just the about end of the fence line, around 500-600 feet away and turned to the left and then just shot up at about a 45-50 degree angle into the nights sky and was gone in nothing flat. again it made no noise what so ever. it took off so fast i couldn't believe it...maybe around, i don't know, like a bullet being shot out of a gun or something like that...just extremely fast....and then it was gone. strangest thing i have ever seen in my life...the reason i am now writing about this is because for years i have been reading articles and watching tv and videos about the subject and have never seen or heard about in the past a ufo shooting fireballs at the ground before...and i am most interested if anyone else has ever seen anything like what i have described. i believe i have seen pictures of a similar looking craft before and could still draw it our if needed. about five minutes after our sighting, a truck pulled in and we jumped on it and went into the warehouse and unloaded it...once we left around 7am we were to scared to drive in behind the buildings to see if we could see any burned spots or anything...it is something i have always regretted not doing. and this is my story of what we saw many years ago..."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arizona","Object Features":"Dome","Object Shape":"Disc, Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Other"}
