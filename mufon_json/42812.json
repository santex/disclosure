When I looked up, I saw a red ball of light ascend from behind a building; I'm thinking it was in the parking lot, which is out of sight line from where I live. It ascended in an arcing manner. I said \"no way,\" and pursued my sight-line on foot because the object had gone behind the leaves of a tree in our backyard. It was totally gone. No noise, no trail, no nothing."],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.808782,+-96.676559(42812)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42812) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"A red glowing ball rose up and disappeared behind tree. when chased to look it was totally gone","Latitude":"40.808782","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere"}
