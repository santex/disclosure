{"Case Number":"29844","divs":["Sighting Details I WAS SITTING IN MY GARAGE LOOKING OUT TO THE WEST TO WATCH SUNSET, WHEN FROM THE WEST CAME A LARGE BLACK SPHERE WITH NO REFLECTION ON SURFACE OF OBJECT IT PRECEDED FROM THE WEST TO EAST THEN IT STOPPED AND MADE 90 DEGREE TURN TO THE NORTH ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AS A JET, THERE WAS NO REFLECTION OF ANY KIND OF LIGHT ON THE SPHERE , BUT IF YOU PUT TOGETHER FIVE JETS AT THAT HEIGHT THIS BLACK SPHERE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SIZE OF 5 JETS IN DIAMETER ! . AS I AM CLOSE TO THE INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT I THOUGHT IT WAS A AIRPLANE BUT IT HAD NO LIGHTS AT ALL , SAID OBJECTS ALTITUDE WAS IN BETWEEN A JET LANDING AND HIGH ALTITUDE AIRPLANES. I THEN CALLED BROWNSBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT AND NO ONE CALLED IN ON SAID OBJECT I WAS VERY SURPRISED ! COULD NOT CONTACT THE AIRPORT CONTROL TOWER. I ALSO HAD THE STRANGE FEELING THAT IT WAS TALKING TO ME , THAT WE ARE GOING TO MEET AGAIN SOON ? SOMETHING ABOUT TRANSFER OF INFORMATION ."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"06/30/2011 09:10 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.152974","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Indianapolis","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.777126,+-86.152974(29844)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29844) map </A>","Summary":"LARGE BLACK SPHERE","Date Submitted":"07/02/2011 04:23 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07022011-0005","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29844.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29844.html"],"trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There was one other sighting in Indianapolis on or around June 30th 2011"],"Latitude":"39.777126","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana"}
