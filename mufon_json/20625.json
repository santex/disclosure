Saw a Black Triangle at about 700 ft altitude flying northwest towards Holloman AFB. I could not tell its exact size but I believe its around the size of a fighter jet. I told several friends about this, one of which knows several Airmen. The airman said it was not a UFO but the replacement for the F-117. They call it \"the raven\". Now we know. Those arent ufo's, they are America's latest stealth birds."],"Log Number":"US-11202009-0005","Date of the Event":"11/15/2009 04:04 UTC"}
