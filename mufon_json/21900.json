It came from the South South West and changed direction and headed over Cold Lake South. and it then headed East, this was 30 min before sunrise. I have been in the Airforce for 13 + years and this was no plane or Jet. The airbase was quiet when I got to work 20 min later, with no flights in or out. This was no plane. It made no noise, just bright gold color star that moved slow and disapeard to the east over Cold lake south."]}
