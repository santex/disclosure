It was 9:55 p.m. in the Swansea Grove. A Giant red almost noodle shaped bright object was hovering 100 feet above a home on the edge of the pond in Ocean Grove with a super ember looking red glow. It then curled into an almost ball shape and moved silently over the Grove and over the coal plant and cooling towers which can be seen flashing red at the bottom of the screen. It then moves towards the Taunton River. It is followed by another one, a few seconds later which is captured in a video taken on the phone. It again features a long curved noodle like shape and at times a round shape. Every five or ten seconds it glows incredibly red and changes shape. Santa? A strange nighttime flying weather balloon or military? No idea. Three witnesses. One strange night"],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Fall River","There were no other sightings in Fall River on or around December 2nd 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Other","City":"Fall River","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Massachusetts","Case Number":"33788","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33788.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33788.html"],"Latitude":"41.709291","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-12032011-0005","Summary":"Tube like red glowing thing that curled into ball like shape with tube extrusion","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/03/2011 09:31 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States"}
