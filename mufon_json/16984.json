It is a spherical, milky white orb with something on the bottom, some kind of small protrusion. It's almost translucent, but you can't see inside of it, still pretty much opaque. Relatively windy day today, you can see the clouds moving kind of quick. Altitude is relatively high, clouds passed by and you could see it was above the clouds as its view was obscured by the clouds. Object is not moving AT ALL, not moving in any direction or changing altitude. If this were a weather balloon, or even a giant tethered balloon, you would definitely see some sway to it as there is definitely some wind up there. Considering it's altitude, the thing has to be just massive.. VERY weird..."]}
