It was around 9pm and they were not in any type of formation and seemed to float along rather slowly at first then went fast. As they flashed, there was no specific time between the intervals as they flashed randomly. They made circles around the mine and dissipated over the mountains to the west rather quick. When I was watching them for a good 30 mins or so it gave me chills and I wish others would have seen what I SAW."]}
