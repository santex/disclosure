I pointed at it saying it was pretty high up to be a helicopter ( because it started to just hover ) and there was no sound to this light . It seemed way to close to earth and the light way too bright to be a sattelite ( i often see sattelites looking at the night sky and often map the night sky on my Starry Night program on my computer ) It is rare to see any aircraft at our location in the trinity alps of the New River . Suddenly the light zig zagged right to left , right to left so fast ( I have never seen anything move so fast ) then suddenly stop and go straight up out of our atmosphere leaving a small vapor trail ( The object emitted no vapor trail until its sudden lightening speed departure into space ). We both yelled out Oh MY GOD ! THAT WAS A UFO ! I thought to myself maybe it is some new technology we have , but then thought why would something humans made have to leave our atmosphere so suddenly . The object made no sound moving or hovering . It was hard to determine the size as although it was clearly in our airspace ( About half the altitude of a high flying commercial jet ) it was only visable as a very bright light . It took me this long to report it because I thought it was insignifucant compared to other reports , but it was an event I will never forget ."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20022.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20022.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Me and another person witness a ufo event at beggining of nighttime","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"20022","Date of the Event":"01/20/2008 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-10192009-0011","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
