[note: the trigger for his decision to finally hunt on the internet for anorganization to which he could report this incident, was the documentary airedin march, 2001 outlining the jan.2000 southern illinois case involving policemenand civilians in various locations.]"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.671389,+-93.705833(1153)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1153) map </A>","Longitude":"-93.705833","Date Submitted":"03/31/1997 09:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"1997, 800-1000ft,w/in 3/4 mile, 6-8rectangular lig","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1153.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1153.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1153.html"],"Region":"Iowa","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"41.671389","Date of the Event":"03/31/1997 09:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
