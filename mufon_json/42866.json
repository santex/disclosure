{"Date of the Event":"09/02/2012 09:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband , and 2 sons went to the blueberry festival to see the balloon launch (glow) just before dark, and to view the fireworks after the glow. It had been stormy, so they did not launch the balloons as planned, they lit the gas in a big fire display ( not attaching the balloons. They did this for over a half hr. or so. Then around 9:30 they started the fireworks. At least it was dark, maybe between 9:30or10:00. The fire works are fantastic, they have these big huge fire bursts, that vibrate your whole body. I have never been or seen these anywhere else. Halfway thru the show, my older son text me on his phone and showed me it on his phone, to look up, ufos. We were sitting way up front, under the fireworks, I had earplugs in and sunglasses on. My husband and son said halfway thru the show, 5 dozen starlike objects (moving stars) traveled east way above the smoke from the fireworks. I saw a few. Before the show started and after wards,, since it was partly cloudy from rain that day, there were only 3 or 4 bright stars visible. So my son who are not interested in ufos, actually said that they were ufos that they saw. I didn't see them since I don't care for the booms and bright lights. I know they were wondering what they were cause they moved and then were out of sight. My husband who doesn't really get into ufos really thought they were. I'm surprised other people didn't report them."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Plymouth","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Indiana","Date Submitted":"09/27/2012 11:50 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.347495,+-86.304408(42866)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42866) map </A>","Longitude":"-86.304408","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Plymouth","There were no other sightings in Plymouth on or around September 2nd 2012"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"41.347495","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"42866","Summary":"moving stars 5 dozen","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-09272012-0018","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42866.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42866.html"]}
