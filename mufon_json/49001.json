I thought it was a helicopter. When I got closer I seen a triangle shaped UFO that was now stationary, hovering over the treetops, with now not only the red light, but circular lights on each of the three corners of the bottom of the vehicle. Also there was a red and blue light on the bottom of the middle of the vehicle. I had passed almost directly under it as I was driving down the road so I was a maximum of 200-250ft away from it at my closest point. I could not believe that a vehicle of this size had no sound emitting from it."],"Summary":"hovering above the tree tops.","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49001.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49001.html"],"Log Number":"US-07172013-0004","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Old Forge","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/17/2013 05:53 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.38211,+-75.753029(49001)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49001) map </A>"}
