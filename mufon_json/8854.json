{"Weather Factors":"Rain","divs":["sighting detailswe were driving from riverside, ca to kingman, az. at about 20:00 pm, on the highway i-40(going east), about 20 miles before the town of essex (somewhere between ludlow and essex, san bernardino county.) we spotted a very large object on the sky (not too high in the sky, probably about 2000 feet.) it was raining a lot at the time. the object was definetely not a reflexion or hollogram. there were four people in the car (me and three friends, all sober and rested before the trip to arizona.) we were driving at about 60 to 70 miles per hour on the i-40 freeway, so the driver did not want to stop on the shoulder. i insisted to stop because i had a very good camera and binoculars in the car trunk (but he did not.) therefore, we have no photos or recording of the object. well, to make the story short, the object we saw resembles those of the movie \"independence day,\" but much smaller. perhaps 3\\4 of a football field (it was big.) we could see a lot of the object's details, such as openings that look like sort of windows (but dark,like leading to the inside of the object), a lot of seams (like doors, gates ???), a lot of irregularities on its surface, greyish self illumination (sort of.) the object was round (like a saucer), as we drove past it we could see what amazed me the most about this sighting: it looks like a bowl upside down. the bottom was not flat, but rounded not as much as we could see sideways towards the top. it was stationary, did not seem to move at all. as we kept driving we lost sihgt of it at the distance. the object's geometry was so defined in all dimentions that it can not be an illusion or hollogram as the \"authorities\" would say. we've talked about this event zillions of times. although we have no picture of the object, we can remember all those details very well. whatever it is, it is real."],"Date of the Event":"03/15/2003 08:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"It looks like one of those crafts from the movie \"Independence Day,\" but much smaller.","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8854.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8854.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.001938,+-92.733364(8854)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8854) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/15/2003 08:00 UTC","Longitude":"-92.733364","Log Number":"US-01142008-0016","City":"essex \\ ludlow(I-40)","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"8854","trends":["there have been no other sightings in essex \\ ludlow(i-40)","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Latitude":"39.001938","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Appendage(s), Other","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
