(it was hard to tell as i was focused on the screen of the video camera). i have worked on military aircraft in the past, worked on the flight line at night & was at sea. no way were these lights from any type of plane or helicopter. i wish i had a tripod!"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"10/14/2013 06:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"29.179635","Case Number":"51554","Summary":"4 orange lights rising from the horizon in a straight line. they slowly faded away, but the even started again a few minutes later.","Longitude":"-82.253494","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Ocala","There was one other sighting in Ocala on or around October 11th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"10/11/2013 09:28 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Ocala","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51554.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51554.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.179635,+-82.253494(51554)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51554) map </A>"}
