{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my back porch, I noticed right below cloud cover, off in the horizen a unusual bright light. It appeared as a star at first glance. The object hovered for around 10-15 seconds. The ufo appeared to be powering up its warp drive. The object got extremely bright the last 5 seconds of hovering then ejected itself from earth in a curved path heading away from earth. It left a tracer behind it that slowly faded away. It was mabey 3 seconds of tracer before it faded. I couldnt see where the object itself went after that due to the cloud cover . The clouds themself were overhead clouds with gaps in it were the night sky could be seen. Yet the clouds did not obstruct the horizon sky north of my position either."],"Summary":"Bright light warp drive into space leaving a tracer.","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"49786","City":"El Paso","Latitude":"31.76167","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.76167,+-106.477681(49786)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49786) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/13/2013 01:51 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:18","Log Number":"US-08132013-0002","Date of the Event":"08/12/2013 11:25 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Longitude":"-106.477681","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49786.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49786.html"],"trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in El Paso","There were no other sightings in El Paso on or around August 12th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
