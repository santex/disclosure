When it was hovering there I was watching the clouds go by it and it never moved, I grabed my binocs and found it was not a bird but a dark matalic ball and at that point I ran inside to grab my camera and wouldent you guess it was gone, seeing enough footage of the balls above mexico city it looked the same."],"Case Number":"18095","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/11/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Folsom","There were no other sightings in Folsom on or around July 11th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-07152009-0009","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-121.172748","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18095.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18095.html"]}
