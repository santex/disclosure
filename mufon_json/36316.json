{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New South Wales","Longitude":"150.862739","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had left a friends home late when looking in a northern direction i notice three orange lights hovering independently in a triangle formation. The brightness of the lights would fluctuate very slowly. No air traffic around. No noise could be heard. I observed the objects for a long time and was confident it wasn't of human engineering. I estimate the lights were at least 3 to 4 miles(approx 6km)away. It was late and had to leave. Years later i met a UFO enthusiast who ironically had seen and filmed the same lights on the same night from a completely different part of town, long before i had ever met him."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"-34.008376","Date Submitted":"03/07/2012 10:51 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ingleburn","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36316.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36316.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-34.008376,+150.862739(36316)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36316) map </A>","Summary":"Three orange lights hovering independendly in a triangle formation.","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"AU-03072012-0018","Country":"Australia","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"36316","Tags":"City","City":"Ingleburn","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/21/2001 11:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
