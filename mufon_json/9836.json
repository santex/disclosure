{"Tags":"City","Summary":"Low craft emitting bluish .lightning with no thunder","Case Number":"9836","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Hawaii","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile on my way back from a late doctors appointement, my friend Gale and I noticed a flash of blue lightning to our left.It remained \"lit up\" for a long count of approximately 2 to 3 seconds. She stopped the car and we were looking at the spot where it had been. Then it (the lightning) happened again. This time we saw definition and it stayed lit up for another long count of 2 to three seconds. It looked like it was coming from an object 70 ft. or less off the ground. We could see the dark outline of something and the lightning came out of the bottom of it. The lightning looked like it was in a glowing martini glass. The top of the \"glass\" tapered down to the \"stem\" and the lightning went through the center of it. There is a small hill in the back of the object and it was below the top of it. We couldn't see exactly what it was but it was not small. I would say it was about 100 ft. long and 30 ft. high. The \"martini glass\" was fairly large and it glowed off the bottom of the craft. There was no sound as with lightning and it was VERY bright. Gale and I looked at each other and she said \"Nobody is going to believe this\". The object was less than a quarter mile away. There was no sound at any time. Then it just disappeared. The next morning a friend dropped over by my house and I asked her if she had noticed anything \"weird\" last night. She (very excitedly) said \"You mean the blue lightning\"? I said yes and she told me that her and her boyfriend and my landlord and other people down the street she had talked to saw it also and they were all talking about how beautiful it was and how it was so strange that there was no thunder and how it lit up the whole area. We didn't get a good look at the object but for an outline of it against the hill. It definately was something that none of us had ever witnessed before. I,ve heard that there is a small resevoir below where it was hovering. Truly mysterious."],"Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"02/03/2008 07:02 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Pāhoa","There were no other sightings in Pāhoa on or around February 3rd 2008"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-154.94375","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9836.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9836.html"],"City":"PÃÂhoa","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-03052008-0005","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:01:08","Latitude":"19.501613","Date of the Event":"02/03/2008 07:02 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=19.501613,+-154.94375(9836)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9836) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
