I noticed something that sounded like a flare being fired and looked up. The object I saw was blue and orange and was moving extremely fast but was at the same distance from me as a plane would be, I first thought it was a meteor until it stopped completely and then made a turn to the south. I was shocked, I am typically pretty skeptical of things like this, and wanted to disprove it in my mind, but I was unable to when it moved the way it did, I have never seen anything quite like it. I was shocked by it, and my husband just looked at me and said, I told you so, haha. I didn't see it again all morning even though I was out driving. I was able to prove it wasn't a meteor shower as we drove out to the country and were unable to see anything at all the resembled a meteor."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16608.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16608.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/21/2009 01:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04212009-0014","Longitude":"-97.513628","City":"Oklahoma City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.47694,+-97.513628(16608)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16608) map </A>"}
