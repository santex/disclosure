(3) when i first reviewed the footage i saw a quick black blip on the screen and knew it was something that i could not identify without further investigation. so, i slowed it down and looked. (4) there are three frames. the first two show something orb-like in shape. the third frame, closest to the sun, shows a reflection and maybe even a shadow from the saucer part (thus i am inclined to say it was a saucer with a dome, kinda like a hat). (5) during the sighting i was skeptical that i would actually film something since i was intentionally trying to debunk a claim that i would see something if i filmed the sun. after i saw the footage i was very intrigued and excited. (6) i did not even see it with the naked eye."],"City":"Eureka","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"U.F.O., A.B.E., Vimana, Drone?","Latitude":"40.804791","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12242012-0012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.804791,+-124.157693(44761)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44761) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44761.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44761.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Date Submitted":"12/24/2012 11:09 UTC"}
