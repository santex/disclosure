{"Region":"Saskatchewan","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn June 25th 2013 sometime between 9pm to 10pm after my cousins grad reception ended we all headed out into the parking lot where we could take some pictures. About 10-15 minutes being in the parking lot people began to leave and we were getting ready to go as well. Then looking up at the evening sky i noticed an object. The object was round and looked like a ball. The color of the object was grey or silver ( Looked as though there was a light before it was not see able anymore) There was no sound visible to hear. I snapped 3 pictures 2 of them did not turn out properly but one did. There where about 8 witnesses to the object. The object flew straight and over head a bit fast and disappeared behind some trees. We then lost the object. Take a look at the picture i snapped (Has not been tampered with only cropped and zoomed for a better see). I believe this was no airplane, Drone, Weather balloon, or helicopter."],"Date of the Event":"06/25/2013 10:05 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"50.458722","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.458722,+-104.604487(48550)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48550) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48550.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48550.html"],"City":"Regina","Case Number":"48550","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Regina","There were no other sightings in Regina on or around June 25th 2013"],"Log Number":"CA-07012013-0014","Country":"Canada","Summary":"Grey or Silver Ball UFO (June 25 2013) Regina, SK","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/01/2013 05:31 UTC","Longitude":"-104.604487"}
