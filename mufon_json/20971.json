{"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","divs":["sighting detailsit was shortly after sunset, around 10pm or so, sometime in july or august in 1997. we were living in ravenna, michigan at the time, when i took my telescope out to look at the stars. ( it is a 8\" celestron c\\s) my son, who was 10 at the time, was with me. we had both been out before, in the past , and had seen saturn, jupiter and mars several times, so we knew what those looked like. on this night, we were looking west, toward lake michigan, when i noticed a fairly bright, orangish star. i found it in my telescope and immediatly realised that it wasn't a star, as it was quite round. my first thought was that we were looking at venus, as i had yet to actually see venus in my scope. i went inside the house to check what planets were available to see. at that time, i had a program on my computer that would show the night sky on any given time and date. according to the program, venus should have been directly east of us, not west. i thought maybe it was mercury instead, but according to the program, mercury should have been under us, not visable for that time of night. all of the other planets should have been above or behind us as well. i went back out to look at it again and was shocked. now there were two orangish, round objects, one on top of the other. i asked my son to look in the scope. i said \"do you see both of them?\" he looked at me and said \"both? there's 4 of them\" i looked again and he was right. there were 4 round objects going straight up and down, like pearls on a necklace. we looked at each other for a minute, then i went back to the telescope. the objects started moving down. i tried to follow them with my telescope, but they eventually disappeared. we tried to make some sense of what we saw, and thought that maybe it was some sort of optical illusion caused by the atmosphere. we continued to look at other stars for about an hour, when i noticed a orangish object rising in the west. we thought it might be the same thing that we had seen an hour earlier, so i swung the telescope around to look at it. as i was about to get it into site, my son said \"it went out\". i looked around, and it was gone. i asked what he meant by 'it went out'. he said that it just went out, like someone had thrown a switch and turned it off. i still think it was probably some sort of illusion, and that somehow we were seeing mercury distorted by the atmosphere. but with all the recent reports of glowing orbs, i'm begining to wonder just what it was that we did see."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20971.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20971.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.189465,+-85.936993(20971)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20971) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.936993","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"4 round sphere/orb like objects","Region":"Michigan","Log Number":"US-12122009-0006","Date Submitted":"12/12/2009 10:48 UTC","Case Number":"20971","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"43.189465","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ravenna","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"06/30/1997 12:00 UTC","City":"Ravenna","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
