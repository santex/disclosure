I was in the passenger seat of my mother's minivan, driving home on A1A. I don't believe my little brother or sister were with me, but my Mom was. As we were driving home, in the later hours of rush hour, I noticed 9 white lights pretty close to the ground. The lights seemed to form three triangles, 3 lights per triangle at the tips. the triangles seemed to just hover above the hightway for everyone to see. Being dark, you could barely make out the craft, but surrounding lights helped a bit. Both me and my mom are largely skeptic and the both of us are atheist, so my mom passed it off as something explainable, but I was transfixed. We eventually passed it on our way home, and I never saw the lights since. Two or three years later, I learned about the Belgian Triangle incident. The craft seen was largely similar to the ones I had seen, and the habits of the craft reported were the same. Both seemed to hover slowly and over large numbers of people. I am not sure what it was, and I have considered the possibility that it was a blimp of some sort, or a sattelite, but none of the blimps common to the area during TPC golf season(the approximate time of the event) emitted lights in that arrangement and the lights were too close to belong to a sattelite I assume. So maybe it's a type of aircraft? I'm not ready to go ahead and say it's of alien origin, because I'm not a believer of extraterrestrial visitation, although I'm open to the possibility if enough evidence ever comes forth and I do believe in extraterrestrial life in some shape or form in the universe. The question of what I saw has eaten at me for four years now, and after finding this site, I decided to document it here. I know it's been too long since the event for an investigation of any sort, but I decided that it would be good to at least share my experience."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/31/2006 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
