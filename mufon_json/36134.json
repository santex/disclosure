We finished up around 2.00am I went outside first wile my co worker set the alarm to the building (burger king) I was covered in degreaser from cleaning the smoke stacks. I was filthy dirty and tired so I laid down where a car would park and looked up��� This is when I saw it right above me with my own two eyes! It was 3 green triangles in formation flying from west to east. I was so scared I ran back to the door and yelled for my co worker to come out and look but he was to busy setting the alarm so I turned around and studied it the best I could and I know one thing it was as real as they get! My mind was not playing tricks with me!!! My co worker came out and saw the tail end of the event but he did not see it like I did!!! It���s been years and ive only told a few people but now it���s time to tell the world.. Oh ya about a couple of weeks after the sighting there was a news broadcast on kxly news 4 Spokane.. The broadcast was a man looking for anyone who had seen anything strange in the sky anytime recent and there was a phone number to call��� So I did and I talked to a retired military officer who wanted to meet me for lunch and talk further but I got scared and hung up the phone. I only wish to share my experience with the world as this event has affected me for some time now!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36134.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/36134_submitter_file1__ufo.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36134.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
