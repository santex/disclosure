The craft looked like a bullet and had BRIGHT green and white flames. The craft was moving faster than any human made air craft I have ever witnessed. It looked like it was flying at such high speeds that the craft actually started burning up green and white flames that were truly magnificent. The craft suddenly appeared and the trajectory was a curved descend. Once we seent he craft it and it started to descend we lost sight of it due to the tree tops of our location. Furthermore, I dialed my friends phone number and described to him what had just happened to me than suddenly my phone connection got distorted and went dead when I had full service (my friend's line was a LAN line)."],"trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Langhorne","There were no other sightings in Langhorne on or around April 12th 2012"],"City":"Langhorne","Longitude":"-74.919596","Log Number":"US-04132012-0014","Date Submitted":"04/13/2012 11:01 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.179024"}
