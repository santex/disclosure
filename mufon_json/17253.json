My place is in the landing pattern for aircraft coming and going from Seattle airport. However last night while stargazing on my back deck I got a glimpse of a bright light. Just as I was turning my head I observed a light that was in the southern ski and vary bright! Not your typical landing light from aircraft. As soon as I saw the light and realized it was out of place it imploded in and was gone! I didn���t observe any lights in the area from where it was to associate it to an aircraft, no flashing strobes nothing, it was just gone. Also, before the sighting I thought I saw a bright light just in the corner of my eye. As I would turn my head it would be gone! Did anyone else see this light?
