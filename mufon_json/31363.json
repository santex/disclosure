This is the 3rd time an object like this has flown directly over our house. This time we were able to grab our video camera. This thing was huge and relatively quite. It made a sound that was almost mechanical, not sure how else to describe it. You could see windows in the craft, but unable to see what was flying it if anything. I flashed a flashlight at it a couple of times, but nothing happened. This is not the same thing we see on a nightly basis outside, this object seems to becoming a weekly thing. Is anyone else seeing these things? We have 3 witnesses and video. Maybe the video can be enhanced, it was recorded in 720p HD."],"Date of the Event":"08/31/2011 09:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08312011-0026"}
