One was ahead of the other and they were quite a distance apart from each other. The first I noticed was moving in a straight line, fast, then as I looked a little to the left of the sky & the first object, I saw another object same size, the color looked a little different then the first. The first one was more silvery, like a star color, the second was amberish. I watched them until they both went out of view. It was a clear night and I saw planes in the sky before, during and after the sightings. I even said out loud that there were no blinking lights on these two objects like there are on airplanes. I felt like, all right, something is going on because this is not the first time I have seen objects like this. But I have never seen two of them in the same sky and formation at the same time."],"Summary":"I noticed two objects moving in a North to South direction.","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.730669,+-73.236725(7006)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7006) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"7006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7006.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7006.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
