{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMyself and 2 fishing friend have camped for 10 years on an island on a lake in mid-Maine for the last 15 years. Always at the end of September when the island is empty. We take a boat ride at sunset to have a few beers and enjoy the view. On our way back in the dark we decided to circle the island. There is a campsite at the east end of the island which I had viisted before. It is wide open and grass covered. Blue orbs the size of basket ball were jumping and rushing through around the site.We witnessed this for 10 minutes till we passed a point.My friend driving the boat was to spooked to stop. The next day we hiked around the island to the site. The grass was 4 inchs high. But not a blade was laided done. No foot prints. Nothing."],"Summary":"Blue spheres.","Longitude":"-69.444369","Date Submitted":"03/26/2010 10:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":[],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22509.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22509.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"22509","City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/28/2006 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"45.260763","Region":"Maine","Log Number":"US-03262010-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.260763,+-69.444369(22509)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22509) map </A>"}
