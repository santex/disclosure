{"Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"11376","Object Features":"Dome, Unknown","City":"Fairless Hills","divs":["Sighting DetailsI live in wisterwood which is about a mile from the oxford valley mall. I walked outside my house at about 9 30 with my gf and I happened to look up into the sky and saw this egg shaped aircraft. It looked a little strange so it caught my attention. It was hovering in the sky above the oxford valley mall direction. As i looked at it, it started out slow then took off. Ive never seen anything so fast in my life. It disappeared like something from a movie. I know this was a UFO because there was a plane traveling at the same time and it was no where near as fast or looked like this did. It looked like something from a movie. I was shocked because i knew what i had saw."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.183014,+-74.848574(11376)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11376) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11376.html"],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Fairless Hills","There were no other sightings in Fairless Hills on or around June 20th 2008"],"Longitude":"-74.848574","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval, Unknown","Summary":"egg shaped aircraft blinking","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07022008-0003","Date Submitted":"06/20/2008 09:30 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/20/2008 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"40.183014","Country":"United States"}
