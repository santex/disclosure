{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"New Jersey","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI let my dogs out in the back yard for the last time before going to bed. Standing on deck I looked up and saw a big bright star. It started to move, but more like hoping or jumping. You could not miss this, it was too close to be a star. I went to the front yard to get a better look. No sound of a motor, as it got closer it looked like 2 bright stars together. A small plane , I could hear that engine flew right near the bright lobject. I live near AC airport and FAA. Center. I got the dogs back into the house and yes I was afraid. Iam 61 year of female, widowed, only lived in this town 1 year 8 months. I really don't want to go see if it's still there. But I would like to know of anyone else who saw this. I know pilot of small plane saw it. I would like to call police but --- they might think I crazy or something."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43856.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43856.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Absecon","There were no other sightings in Absecon on or around November 11th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.486836,+-74.543679(43856)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43856) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/11/2012 11:55 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-11112012-0030","Longitude":"-74.543679","Latitude":"39.486836","Date of the Event":"11/11/2012 10:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Absecon","Case Number":"43856","Summary":"2 very bright white stars together -- jumping back and forth side to side"}
