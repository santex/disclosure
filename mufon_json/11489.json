{"City":"Harrisville","Longitude":"-83.287729","Summary":"I saw a fiery ball slowly crossing the sky that I thought at first was a meteor. It moved slowly / steadily. I watched it cross the sky over Lake Huron.","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting outside with my daughter at our campfire while camping at Harrisville State Park in Michigan. Around 11pm, I looked up into the sky and saw a fiery ball crossing the sky from west to east. At first I thought it was a meteor but it was quite large (about the size of a dime), and did not streak or throw off sparks. I was quite puzzled about what I was seeing. It progressed slowly and steadily across the sky. My daughter and I ran a few feet to the beach to get an unobstructed view as it crossed the sky over Lake Huron. It seemed to hover for a minute or 2 and move sideways back and forth for a while. It then moved more quickly across the sky until it was no longer visible towards the horizon. It was silent and did not appear to have lights of any kind except the fiery glow. I have know idea what this might have been but if anyone has any ideas I'd like to hear them!"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Harrisville","There were no other sightings in Harrisville on or around July 1st 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.658522","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.658522,+-83.287729(11489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11489) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball","Weather Factors":"Windy","Date of the Event":"07/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-07082008-0016","Case Number":"11489","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11489.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11489.html"]}
