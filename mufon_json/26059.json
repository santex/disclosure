We had the BEST crab feast ever (but no alcohol). We went down the hill (Sanjon st)towards a dead end towards the beach. We stopped at the stop sign to turn left. Over the ocean (just south of us) we both saw a large cigar shaped (gray in color) object hovering over the ocean and then it started moving towards the direction of land (semi fast). We tried to drive along the beach and track it down to take a picture, but by time we got to the beach area at Seward, it was too far down to take a picture or see clearly. This thing seemed like a giant barge or something in the sky. It was huge! Seemed too long and too flattend (cigar not round) to be a blimp or plane. No other aircraft was in the sky. I thought it was a cloud formation (it was cloudy) at first until we saw it moving, gliding smoothly, but a good speed twords land. This was a first for us."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar","Region":"California","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Ventura","Date of the Event":"10/21/2010 06:23 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26059.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26059.html"],"trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Ventura","There were no other sightings in Ventura on or around October 21st 2010"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-119.225215"}
