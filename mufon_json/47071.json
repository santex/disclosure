Initially thought airplane but object's lights were not consistent with navigation lights on aircraft. I am a 21 yr Army vet and have seen many US and foreign aircraft ... this wasn't an aircraft with which I am familiar. After watching it hover I decided to go in for a break. After two hours the object was essentially static in its same position. Three hours later it was still visible in the same trajectory and relative position (45 degrees above horizon) but noticeably smaller causing me to assume it was making very slow progress eastward. Even later that evening I could only barely make out the object but it still appeared to be flashing red, green, and blue lights (equal brightness) sequentially."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around April 28th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.151862,+-110.885379(47071)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47071) map </A>","Region":"Arizona","City":"Tucson","Longitude":"-110.885379","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47071.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47071.html"],"Log Number":"US-04292013-0011"}
