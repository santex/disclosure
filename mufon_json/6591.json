The sky was just starting to get dark and I noticed a very bright star to the west of where I was standing then noticed the big dipper start to form. That's when I saw a star like shape moving, only this time the shape moved South to North and was moving slowly. There were planes in the sky that had blinking lights, this object did not have any blinking lights and it was luminious like a star. When I look up at the sky I look to see if any thing is moving, and that is what first made me notice it. When I saw the object I was like \" not again?\" I just noticed something the other night, and around the same time too. My feelings were of astonishment and anxiety, also I said I can not report this, I just reported something the other night these guys are going to think I am nuts..."],"Date Submitted":"03/20/2007 07:35 UTC","Longitude":"-73.244295","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
