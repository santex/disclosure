I stared at it for a few minutes trying to determine if it was a conventional aircraft but could not identify any features to support this. After watching it change color and fade in and out, I went inside and grabbed my camera to take a few photos. Unfortunately they did not come out well, but it is apparent what I saw was larger and brighter than a regular star. The object was stationary the entire time and did not appear to have any identifying features standard to conventional aircraft. Photos available upon request by an investigator."],"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"San Tan Valley","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/08/2012 11:46 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36339.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36339.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in San Tan Valley","There were no other sightings in San Tan Valley on or around March 8th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.175347,+-111.527519(36339)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36339) map </A>","Case Number":"36339","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
