{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was with my mom when it happened. She was on a businesstrip in Sunne, Sweden. I'm not sure about the date, but I am pretty sure it was the end of July, 2006. We were staying at the \"Selma Lagerl���f Spa & Hotell\". When the time was maybe... 10.45PM I went back to our room. My mom was still downstairs talking with some friends. I think our room was on the 4th floor. I'm sure it was the top floor, but I can't remember how many floors there were. I undressed and got ready to go to bed. But, wanting to see the stars, which I love, I went out on the balcony and looked up in the sky. The first thing I noticed was 3 lights, much more powerful than the stars. They were shaped in a perfect triangle and they were colored... I think there was two white and one red. However, the red light was switching all the time. In a random or advanced pattern, the red light switched positions all the time, maybe one switch per second. Of course, a white light took it's previous place. I looked amazed at the sky, because I have always loved UFO:s, science and the paranormal. I had goosebumps all over, my heart was pounding and I felt really happy. I ran for my cellphone with camera and tried to film it. But cellphones aren't so good at filming the nightsky with, and I couldn't see anything on it. Instead, I looked at the time. It was 11.02PM. That I can remember perfectly. As first I had seen the triangle, I thought it was a UFO. I tried to make it look like something else. But a plane moves, this one was standing perfectly still. A plane has different lights, with simplr patterns and other colors. A tower needs... a tower. And there was no such tower beneath it. A helicopter makes noise, this was noiseless. So I finally came to the conclusion that this was a UFO or something that looked very much like it. I watched it for maybe 5 minutes, but it didn't do anything at all. So, I went to bed. But I was truly happy, because I felt that maybe they weren't moving because the lights were a message for me or that they were watching me."],"Latitude":"59.836558","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Sunne","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Sunne","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"A triangular object hovered above our hotel","Date of the Event":"07/26/2006 11:02 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"18605","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=59.836558,+13.144046(18605)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18605) map </A>","Region":"VÃÂ¤rmland County","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"13.144046","Log Number":"SE-08112009-0013","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18605.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"Kingdom of Sweden","Date Submitted":"07/26/2006 11:02 UTC","Weather Factors":"None"}
