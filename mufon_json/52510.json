When we made a left onto Lloyd in downingtown i happened to look up and saw two fire balls flying a straight path across the sky; 1 big and 1 small. I quickley called my husband and told him to go out on the deck to look at them. He knows every airplane known to man and probably built a model for almost all as well and he too, was baffled. They were so quick too. I turned the car around for a second look and they were gone. My husband said that while outside watching, he heard no sound from either object. I went to bed that night and couldnt breathe. I think i might have been feeling anxious over what i had witnessed. I dont usually seek out websites to express things, but i feel obligated to report this."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
