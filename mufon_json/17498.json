{"Case Number":"17498","Date Submitted":"06/14/1992 09:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhat I���m about to tell you has left me wondering what it was I witnessed 17 years ago. The incident took place at my then residence, 981 Gill Ave, Oxford Michigan in Oakland County, on a Sunday evening in June 1992 (not clear as to the exact date). At approximately 9:30 pm, my wife (at that time) and our three small children had been watching television in our living room and were now getting ready for bed. There was a storm brewing to the south of us, which was producing a brilliant light show, as summer storms usually do in Michigan, I was intrigued by the storm and watched it while my wife got the kids off to bed. I had been watching the storm now for a few minutes when my wife came back into our living room to kiss me goodnight, she wasn���t interested in the storm and went off to bed, I told her I would come to bed in a few minutes. As I continued to watch the storm, I began to notice a glowing white ball of light to the west of the storm, it didn't blink or flicker and it was hovering just above the tree line approximately 3 to 5 miles from my line of sight. My first thought was it must be an airplane or perhaps a helicopter, but after a minute or two I noticed it didn���t move like airplane, it moved a little bit at a time (unlike an airplane), I was thinking it must be a helicopter. I became more fascinated by the ball of white light then the storm and decided to step outside to see if I could get a better look, this is when everything got very strange. First, you must understand that my house sat on the corner of a very busy road (Gill St. & Drahner Road) you can mapquest it, the speed limit on Drahner was 45mph, everyone exceeded that! Needless to say I was now standing in the middle of Drahner Rd. watching something that made no sounds, moved very slowly and had no visible shape, just a bright white ball of light floating directly above the tree line and gradually getting closer to me, keep in mind I was walking down the road in the direction of the ball of light which seemed to be wanting me to come closer to it (I know that sounds strange but I felt as if something wanted to observe me, has much as I want to observe it) the ball of light was directly above me now at a distance of maybe 20��� to 25���, at this time I had also noticed I was clearly farther away from my house a good 35��� to 40��� away, I had walked down the middle of a busy road, didn���t see one car, didn���t hear one sound, not even a breeze, I observed the light for maybe two or three minutes from this position, I was feeling a bit terrified now because I knew this wasn���t a helicopter, and it definitely wasn���t a plane. The light was very bright and it was impossible to make out any kind of shape. It slowly moved up and over the trees and that was the last I saw of it. I then realized I was a good distance from my house, in my pj���s, in the middle of Drahner Road, and still absolutely silent. I immediately turned around and began to run back to the house, I got back into the house and noticed it was now around 11pm. I ran down the hallway to our bedroom and woke my wife, I tried to explain I just saw something weird in the sky and needed her to witness it. She came reluctantly to the kitchen, where we looked out the back window, there wasn���t anything in the sky for her to see, I told her I had just witnessed something I couldn���t explain, she told me, ���go back to bed you���ve been dreaming���. I didn���t sleep that night, not after that. I don���t know what it was I saw, it wasn���t a plane or a helicopter that much I know. I put this incident behind me, but for whatever reason it���s been in my thoughts for a few months now. I have a new wife and family and reside in Arizona, I���m a Broadcast Engineer for a satellite corporation, my wife is a second grade school teacher, we have two young children together, I don���t use drugs, I don���t drink, and didn���t when I had the sighting, I just have the urge to tell someone about this. I wish I had called the police, fire department or someone official when this happened to me, maybe someone else saw it besides me.
