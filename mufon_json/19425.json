{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI just pulled out of my driveway when I looked up towards Mount Mansfield and noticed a very large, triangular shaped, light hovering over the mountain. At first, I thought it was possibly northern lights then quickly realized it definitely was NOT. The light was so big that it is very hard to describe. It was a very large triangular smoke-like light. It hovered there for a few seconds then it looked like it went straight up in the sky and vanished into the atmosphere. CRAZY! I called my mom immediately, then my brother. He then told me about this site. He called me back 10 minutes later to tell me people in Maine and NY reported the same thing tonight. WOW I am completely blown away! I was a skeptic but I'M A BELIEVER NOW! I sure wish I had time to get my camera out. . . THAT WAS AMAZING!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"44.476882","Case Number":"19425","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.202622","City":"Burlington","Object Shape":"Cone, Triangle","Summary":"No solid object just a VERY large triangular shaped light that hovered then vanished","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 08:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Burlington","There was one other sighting in Burlington on or around September 19th 2009"],"Region":"Vermont","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.476882,+-73.202622(19425)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19425) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 09:32 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09192009-0042","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19425.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19425.html"]}
