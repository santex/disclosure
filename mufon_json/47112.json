This activity is becoming more frequent and I know that I am not the only witness who lives in this lake. These craft appear triangular and solid with bright white lights resembling search lights on its ventral surface, as well as white and red running lights that flash sequentially. They maintain a more or less straight flight path and fly at very low altitude, less than 500 feet from ground level. I am obviously excited and curious, as this isn't the first sign of UFO activity near this area."],"Date Submitted":"05/02/2013 12:35 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Coatesville","There were no other sightings in Coatesville on or around May 2nd 2013"]}
