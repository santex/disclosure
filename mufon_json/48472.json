Overhead I heard a jet so I looked up to see what kind it was. To the west, high up I saw a jet with a contrail heading west. But right behind it, also very high up was what looked to be a white ball. I could make out the shape of the jet, this was as large but she shape of a ball. It didn't leave a contrail and seemed to overtake the jet just to the left of it. It was moving at a similar speed. That was what struck me as so odd, it was the shape of a ball, white in color. After about 5 seconds both disappeared in the clouds. I went to Flight radar 24 and found a jet heading west but only one in the area. 9:00 AM over berks County Pa. I saw a strange light back on April 1st at night and reported it, this occurred during the day."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
