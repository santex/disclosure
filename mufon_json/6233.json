{"Tags":"City","Summary":"no object sighted very very strong explosion with strong burnt smell","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Latitude":"34.297855","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing outside my business cleaning garabage cans out. I then heard and felt a very very strong explosion. then seconds later I experienced a strong burnt smell. Two other people outside experienced the smell. Many people heard the sound. I then called the Sheriffs Office to report and explosion. A search of the area found nothing. I then called them back to have them get in touch with Texas DPS for a NORAD contact. Texas DPS did get them in contact with NORAD. NORAD did confirm an explosion. To be exact they said it was a large house explosiion; however they could not pin point such. After a search of the county nothing found. This moring the Air Force says they dont have a clue as to what it was??? Again NO objects of any kind were or have been reported at this time. To add to this at the time of the explosion it was so strong I felt I need to dive for cover. I spoke with a local firefighter and he expressed the same.
