It quickly descended into the treeline or cloud in an arc shape. It lasted just a few seconds, but the object was very large and in front of the clouds--not like an airplane or jet at all. Hard to say if it was a meteorite--but if it was, it was very large...large enough that I waited to listen to hear if it hit--but there was no sound, and it didn't have a trail, and didn't streak through the sky--it definitely curved through."],"City":"Greenland"}
