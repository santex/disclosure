{"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI heading East while driving on Southeast Mill Plain coming up to SE 164th ave when I saw the cross shaped flying object in the sky. It appeared sort of flat, then turned sideways which is when I noticed it looked like a cross or plus sign. It had blinking lights on the shape. I was traveling about 40 MPH and was able to keep up with the object. I pulled into the Best Buy parking lot to get a better view. It continued moving through the air. I got back into my car and started to follow it again while heading towards my home. It started to turn off to the left (North) when that direction for a few minutes, then started to head West. I arrived home a few minutes later and asked my wife to come outside, but by the time she made it outside, it was pretty far away and she couldn't see the lights. This was around 9:45 pm tonight on March 13, 2012."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"45.642437","Date Submitted":"03/14/2012 01:35 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36451.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36451.html"],"Log Number":"US-03142012-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Vancouver","There were no other sightings in Vancouver on or around March 13th 2012"],"Summary":"I was driving on SE Mill Plain when I saw the cross flying object in the sky","Longitude":"-122.498697","City":"Vancouver","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Washington","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.642437,+-122.498697(36451)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36451) map </A>","Case Number":"36451","Date of the Event":"03/13/2012 09:40 UTC","Object Shape":"Cross","Country":"United States"}
