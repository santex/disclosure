There were many other cars, but none noticed or just didnt care. They were a yellow-orange in color and they did not pulse or flash. The reason I recorded, or tried to, was because I could not see any shape and they all moved freely from each other. I followed them for a minute (approx.) and pulled over at the street near the post office. By the time I pulled over it appeared that they went straight up (not abruptly) and disappeared. I then went to the KFC parking lot and called a couple of friends and reviewed my video. Its a really bad video!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31030.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31030.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.760594,+-90.601532(31030)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31030) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/20/2011 12:17 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-90.601532","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"31030","City":"St Charles","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in St Charles","There were no other sightings in St Charles on or around August 19th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
