waited for orb to go up in sky again but saw nothing. dogs were barking furiously, some one yelled shut up and every thing went silent. ti was cold but it suddenly became even colder. a jet was going overhead and i could not hear the sound of it after it passed by, which i thought was very unusual. got the pups back inside and continued to watch, but saw nothing else. then all of a sudden i heard the cyotes howling and yepping to the north of me, i went back inside and to bed. myself and the pups were sick for a few days after that. one would not eat(b) and(t) the other had a rash on his stomach. my cat smooth had a bald spot behind his two frount legs, and would not stay in the house for longer than to eat. i was sick to my stomach for about 3 days and could only eat saltines. since then i have had problems sleeping. the pups have been aggitated.this was 10-20-28-08contacted by m.m.z. mufon10-29-08. since then i have had a continuous series of unexplained marks on my body. little marks on my collar bone like cat scratches, soar and irritated, small round, wounds above my ankle on my left foot and leg. strange dreams, feeling sick again,pups aggitated. where i had my tooth removed in6?23?08 a strange gray object worked its way out of the wound. unfortunately i threw it away. but afrer an mri in december i had a boil appear behind my upper left(last)moler and now there appears or feels like some thing is wedged in behind it. 12-20-08 my son and i were returning from gainesville and my grand daughters graduation, we took a rural route home, on our home i saw a light through the trees, i thought it might be a hunting camp or tower of some kind, but it was not it is to swampy in that area for anything like that. i never minentioned it to my son as the road is rough aand we had a 45 degree turn to make up the road. it did how ever seem to me now thst it took longer to get home thsn it should have. since then i have had a rash in and around my navel,small blood moles appear on my stomach, like some ome put wax on my stomach and pulled all the hair folicals out. my doctor said they could be the results of an infection. i do not know if my son has had any side effects, he has not mentioned it if he has. signing off for now bar. ps the last orbe was white round and had red and blue light changes in the right side. i felt no alarm, just a little anxious. we only passed one truck on the road, with like very bright hallegin lights that were above the hood of my sons bronko. the road is uneven, bumpy and no dividing lines, so we had to drive slow, for about 10 miles or so until we got to the newly paved road section. about the size of a regulsr marble. since this time i have noticed the water that flows from my bathroom faucet sometimes flows to the left rather than the right.????????? i thought it might be some kind of seddiment on the screan so i cleaned it it still dose it. pss went to family cemitary recently, when i arrived it was cool my pups like to run and play search for deer sents. they did not allert to anything but when i went inside the fince there was a wooshing sound like a low flying jet, only not as loud as a jet, softer more muted then a rush of heat about 5-6 degrees warmer than it had previously been a seconed ago. i looked up the trees did not move with the sound or the heat. there was a sound like a deer snorting his\\ her alarm, a seconed or two later there was a more throaty sound. maybe a bear made it. but that would not explain the jet sound nor the heat i felt. needless to say i gathered the pups up and we left. i felt very uncomfortable and anxious. and i have felt that way ever since. this happoned two or three weeks ago."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"12/23/2005 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"14979","Date Submitted":"12/23/2005 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Sphere, Square, Rectagular, Star-like, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Since moving to this location in 2005 I have had the feeling I have been stalked.","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Mayo","Latitude":"30.055361","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Mayo","There were no other sightings in Mayo on or around December 23rd 2005"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.055361,+-83.167308(14979)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14979) map </A>","Log Number":"US-01182009-0008","Longitude":"-83.167308","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply"}
