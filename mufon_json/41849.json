I was outside with my brother in law looking for meteors when a VERY bright orange red sphere appeared over Lake Michigan to the west I ran inside to tell my parents and nephew and retrieve my camera. We observed the object for approximately 2 minutes, it stopped for about 20 seconds then continued east. It then dimmed changed shape slightly then disappeared at 80-90 degrees. My camera with new batteries took one photo then froze open and would not work even with other batteries, when I checked the SD card NO image was recorded!?"],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
