I AM USED TO OBSERVING SAT AND METEOR. USUALLYSATS ARE NORTH TO SOUTH,AND METEOR ANY DIRECTION. THE THING ABOUT THISOBSERVATION THAT I FOUND REMAKABLE IS THE VISUAL. IT IS THE UNREMAKABLE THATOCCURED TO ME. APPERARED TRAVELING WEST. DARK, BUT AS IF REFRACTING THE CITYLIGHT. VERY FAST. MUCH FASTER THAN AIRCRAFT THAT USUALLY TRAVEL IN THIS AREA.AIRCRAFT OUT OF DFW AND LOVE FIELD USUALLY GO OVERHEAD ANY GIVEN DAY. SO FROMTHAT I WOULD SAY THAT OBJECT SPEED WAS MUCH GREATER. NO LIGHT EMMITTING FROM. NOSTROBE NOTHING. I HAVE BEEN OBSERVING AIRCRAFT ALL MY LIFE. FROM THIS I CAN ONLYGIVE A GUESS THAT THIS OBJECT WAS VERY HIGH, AND VERY FAST. ABOUT FOUR TO SIXSECONDS, VISUAL TIME. ENOUGH TIME FOR ME TO SEE STAND UP AND AQUIRE AGAIN. WASPRETTY COOL. JUST ANOTHER TO ADD TO THE LIST OF PERSONAL ENCOUNTERS WITH THEUNIVERSE. AS WITH MOST SKY OBSERVATION HERE, LIGHT POLUTION MASKED THE OBJECT INTHE END."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1904.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1904.html"],"Latitude":"32.766796","Date of the Event":"10/05/2002 04:08 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.766796,+-96.599159(1904)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1904) map </A>","Longitude":"-96.599159","Date Submitted":"10/05/2002 04:08 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Mesquite","There were no other sightings in Mesquite on or around October 5th 2002"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Oval","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Texas","Summary":"ROCK"}
