The three lights seemed to be in a triangular formation and were moving incredibly fast with no sound; no jet engines, no props, no rotors. The object had no running lights, only 3 constant white lights, and was certainly flying well below the cloud ceiling. I would estimate the flying height of the object to be 4,000 to 5,000 feet up. The object moved across my field of view, across the top of the treeline from right to left, in about 6-7 seconds."],"Date Submitted":"10/08/2008 11:38 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.525656,+-71.095289(12966)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12966) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"42.525656","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12966.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12966_submitter_file1__light_appearance.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12966_submitter_file2__ufo_2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12966.html"],"City":"Reading"}
