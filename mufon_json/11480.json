{"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Lansdale","There was one other sighting in Lansdale on or around January 22nd 1996"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsEvery night after I use the bathrooom, I always look out my back window into my backyard. At approx 5:00AM-- what I saw was so amazing I woke up my children - (then 14 & 11) andcalled my next door neighbors. About 30 feet beyond my window there are many trees-in a wooded area--I saw a hovering disc shaped object with orange & yellow blinking lights. It seemed to be scanning the ground. There were also yellow blinking lights going back & forth in about a 10 yard stretch from my neighbors property to mine. This entire episode lasted about an hour until daybreak -then either it disappeared or was not visible. I called my local police to see if anyone else reported this siting-they said no. But 2 officers came over to my house & looked around but saw nothing--The next day my neighbor & I walked into the woods where I had seen the siting & again there was no indication of anything being there where I saw it. I was constantly being teased for what I saw --like I made it up --but to this day I still have a very vivid memory of that startling experience. And I do believe it was something that cannot be explained.. I feel very fortunate to have witnessed such an extradinary site. It gives me the chills when I recall the episode."],"Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11480.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11480.html"],"Log Number":"US-07082008-0007","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.250525,+-75.276836(11480)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11480) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.250525","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"01/22/1996 05:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-75.276836","Object Shape":"Disc, Fireball, Saturn-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"11480","Date of the Event":"01/22/1996 05:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Lansdale","Summary":"I saw a hovering object with yellow & orange blinking lights in my backyard"}
