He said there was someone pulled over behind us. Then suddenly the craft shot up and was gone. The only thing I remember is pulling over. I cannot remember the craft or the people behind us. Years later I was hiking near a large lake (daytime) when I heard a sound above me, in my mind before looking up I pictured something as large or larger than a football field ( the sounds was just so powerful), needless to say I was frightened to actually look, but even so I did and to my amazement there was nothing there physically, but the sound was there and i could hear it slowly move off to my right over the lake then it was gone."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25689.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25689.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.155171,+-123.198703(25689)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25689) map </A>"}
