The next day I was at the balcony smoking a cigarette and saw this light coming from south to north over the sea to my left (East). I grabbed the camera and took 3 photos, it was fast. I downloaded and what I saw was just a smudge, but I saw something odd! I'm attaching the pictures maybe with some software you can see it better, Thanks."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/14/2009 04:42 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.013171,+-80.14552(15517)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15517) map </A>","City":"Hollywood"}
