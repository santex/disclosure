As I passed the trees, the light was very bright as when an airplane is approaching you in an angle where you can see its headlights. However, the light remained stationary and no sound came from it ( I lowered my car window to try to hear anything). To verify if the object was moving I decreased my car speed to about 25mph and it still appeared stationary. The object appeared too close and too big to be star. At least every other star I ever saw. When I reached my destination, I got out of the car and the object was still there, stationary. The light was solid and did not blink as stars do. After finishing the task at hand which lasted maybe 15 minutes I drove back home but was not able to locate the object in the sky any longer. All other stars that I recall where in the same reference position."],"Longitude":"-73.187947","Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"41.190928","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Bridgeport","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/30/2007 05:25 UTC","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Region":"Connecticut","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Bridgeport","There were no other sightings in Bridgeport on or around September 30th 2007"],"Summary":"Very large star like object with bright white color","Log Number":"US-10062007-0004"}
