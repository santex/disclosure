We looked up. Saw a plane. Then saw the craft. 6 more appeared in a few minutes. All the same. All over the sky. They were flashing in a circular pattern very fast. They were flashing red white and green. Very distinct. We watched them hover. The first one we saw was moving left then stopped immediately and moved right at the same speed. Lasted for about 45 minutes. The crafts hovered then just disappeared. Very weird. We counted 3 airplanes in the sky at the time. Flying away from the crafts."],"Date Submitted":"11/16/2012 11:15 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date of the Event":"11/16/2012 10:30 UTC","City":"Stewartstown","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.782438,+-76.627254(43959)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43959) map </A>"}
