{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were traveling North on Hwy 169 just North of Garrison, Mn. My wife was driving and she pointed out what appeared to be headlights of a plane and said something to the effect of ���look how low he is flying���. I looked to the Northwest of our line of travel and saw what appeared to be one plane following another very low over the trees. I said something to the effect of ���there are two of them, and look how close they are following each other. They must be military or maybe helicopters.���. The first object crossed Hwy 169 in front of us and disappeared. We passed right under the second object and I stuck my head out of the passenger window and initially was looking straight up at it. I could see it silhouetted against the stars. It was at this point that I realized that it wasn���t any normal plane, or helicopter. It looked similar to the outline of a stealth jet. The object went out over Lake Mille Lacs. It was moving too slow to be a plane and it wasn���t making any noise. It only had green lights on its underside and it wasn���t shaped like a plane"],"Longitude":"-93.820062","City":"Garrison","Case Number":"44071","Date Submitted":"11/21/2012 07:06 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"two flying objects crossed path. passed under second object. no sound and going to slow with improper lighting.","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Boomerang","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.295634,+-93.820062(44071)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44071) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44071.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44071.html"],"Log Number":"US-11212012-0010","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Garrison","There were no other sightings in Garrison on or around November 16th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"46.295634","Region":"Minnesota","Date of the Event":"11/16/2012 08:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
