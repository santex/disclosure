{"divs":["Sighting DetailsSighting #4 May 4, 2004 8:00pm I spotted a bright orange-red ball appearing from the northwest. It was low in the sky, tree top height to small airplane height. It seemed to fly erratically and going slowly (30mph) as it got closer. Right above the corner of my street it took a right turn up my street (north). My husband and I chased it up the street just to see where it was going. It is strange but people on the street never looked up even though we were running and pointing and saying, ���Look!��� We ran 2 blocks more when it picked up speed and was gone. I think it was about the size of a Volkswagen beetle."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.748074,+-104.980513(18948)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18948) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"18948","Summary":"Not Provided","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18948.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18948.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"39.748074","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-104.980513","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-08292009-0012","City":"Denver","Date Submitted":"05/04/2004 08:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/04/2004 08:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around May 4th 2004"]}
