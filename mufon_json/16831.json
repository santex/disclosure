I was traveling east on the PA turnpike. Around 4:30 am in Sept. I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star in front and to the left of my car about 2 miles away. It just appeared about 500 feet off of the ground and shot straight down into the woods and disappeared. It was not like any shooting star I have seen and I have seen many, The way it came out of nowhere and then into the woods was very odd. My first thought after I saw it was holy crap I think I just saw a UFO?! I was pretty freaked out to say the least. It was a little east of Morgantown PA, which has plenty of woods around if anyone is familiar with it. Maybe it was a shooting star, but I have never seen anything like that before."],"Log Number":"US-05072009-0017"}
