(i usually have the blinds in my bedroom about 1\\3 of the way down.) i forgot until saturday evening when i turned on my television and my tivo that i had recorded during the exact time of the event. because i'm very sure that it was the second burst of static that caused me to turn off the television, i can time the start of the event (using the tivo clock) at precisely 10:42. in retrospect, the static on the television is very interesting. our cable service is very reliable here and is not affected by the weather at all. neither my sister nor i can ever recall seeing bursts of static since we've had this service (more than four years) and they are dramatic. both are preserved on my tivo. witness two: on the evening of friday, 5\\21\\04 i was in my bedroom reading. a very powerful thunderstorm had been right over our building for approximately ten minutes when my sister came into my room and asked me to come look at something. i glanced at the clock and noted that it was 10:46pm. she asked me to look out the window in her bedroom at the sky over rock creek park. i saw at different times 1, 2, 3, or 4 blurry, yet distinct white lights moving counterclockwise in an apparent oval shaped orbit. the cloud cover was heavy, but my perception was that the lights were within or circling one particular cloud. the lightning was intense and lit up the entire sky several times as we watched the lights. the lights moved constantly in an erratic, jerky fashion, seemingly unaffected by the lightning. their movement appeared ghostly to me and i thought of casper cartoons. their shape is harder to describe. narrow at the bottom and wider at the top is close ��� almost torch-like with indistinct edges. it was my impression that their blurry, undefined appearance was due to the cloud cover and extremely hazy skies. after about ten minutes the intensity of brightness dimmed and i realized that only one light was still visible as it gradually disappeared. the storm raged on for another few minutes. my sister and i talked for a minute or two and i went back to my room at approximately 11:00pm."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.903092,+-77.032876(30028)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30028) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/06/2011 06:41 UTC","Summary":"Fireballs over Washington, DC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30028.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30028.html"],"Case Number":"30028","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Washington","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Washington","There was one other sighting in Washington on or around May 21st 2004"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/21/2004 10:42 UTC","Log Number":"US-07062011-0022"}
