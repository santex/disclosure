It would drop in the sky about 2 feet until it was behind trees ! Came insisde & told my husband & then he went to the front yard & called me out there was 7 \" unidentified flying Objects \" that circled above our house for 2-3 hrs . I have watched many planes , helicopters & jets fly over my home in the 23 yrs I have lived here and these were not any of the above !! Very quiet and would just circle , following one another tried to get pictures but all ya really see is a light in the sky !! This is not an airplane , jet or helicopter , this has been going on approx . since the end of June & almost every night between 9 pm & 11 pm !! I was very shocked , and had to call my children to have them see these objects !!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25040.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25040.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/09/2010 08:41 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Objects flying around area for approx . 2-3 hrs bright light then will move & see flashing & very slow moving.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.180554,+-74.915826(25040)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25040) map </A>","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-74.915826","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Langhorne","There were no other sightings in Langhorne on or around August 8th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.180554","City":"Langhorne","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball, Square, Rectagular, Triangle","Log Number":"US-08092010-0012","Case Number":"25040","Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States"}
