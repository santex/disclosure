I'm not a UFO hunter or anything. We are close to an airport and some UK and US airforce bases. In the large picture, the object is 1 third from the top and 2 fifths from the left. It looks a bit like a beach hat if you zoom in on it. I didn't notice it till I opened the file on my PC as a RAW file. The shot was taken just outside Norwich city centre."],"Date Submitted":"11/21/2008 04:24 UTC","Summary":"I just found this after checking the RAW file."}
