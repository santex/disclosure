It was extremely long and large, like a giant oval shaped light which reappeared again and again about 15 times, each time, getting dimmer. As if it was heading deeper into space. It was extremely unusual as it was extremely up from space vs. the sky, and it kept me watching each time it reappeared as I counted. It did not eminate from anything flashing upward to the sky. It eminated from something up in space. It was very unique and unusual to see a light coming from space, and re-appearing up to 15 times before it finally dimmed to where I could no longer count its appearances. It was re-appearing in the exact same spot vs. moving or traveling, and it certainly was no helicopter. It was just this gigantic glow of light, likely hundreds or thousands of feet in length, giant, and appearing from space, noticeable in the night's sky."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/19/2012 05:17 UTC","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around January 13th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"34976"}
