{"Object Flight Path":"Other","divs":["Sighting DetailsI walked into my back yard for a breathe of air, looked up and saw a brightly lit blue object in the sky.I watched for a few seconds as it made some small-ish circles in the sky.I realized it was not a helicopter or airplane,and I yelled for my husband to come see it.We watched as it made incredible soaring and diving movements,as well as circles and holding perfectly still.It looked as if it was playing in and out of the clouds. It reminded me of a hawk or vulture flying on thermals,it was incredibly graceful and smooth moving. We watched for at least ten minutes,it moved south east from where I originally saw it, and simply vanished. We were amazed by the object's fluid movements. We were glad we both saw this object, it's movements were very beautiful."],"Case Number":"41842","Latitude":"33.5898","Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-08182012-0021","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There was one other sighting in Phoenix on or around August 17th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-112.151383","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41842.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41842.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"cobalt blue, brightly lit,appeared to be almost a flat line","Date Submitted":"08/18/2012 07:59 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/17/2012 10:40 UTC","City":"Phoenix","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.5898,+-112.151383(41842)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41842) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
