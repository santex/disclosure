It angled sharply upward then, all the time looking like it was afire, and finally, after maybe 3-5 minutes, disappeared when it was very high in the sky. It was traveling in a northeast direction. We have a lot of plane traffic but it was definitely not an aircraft. My first reaction was that it looked like a hot air balloon burning."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Inver Grove Heights","There was one other sighting in Inver Grove Heights on or around January 24th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-93.072722","Summary":"flaming","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Inver Grove Heights","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35259.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35259.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/26/2012 09:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
