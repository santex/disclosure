When I reviewed my photos I noticed that one had two black circles (one larger than the other) against the moon. I can't tell what the objects are but I do not believe that they are the result of a smudge on the camera lens since I took a photo seconds before this one and seconds after and they do not have these circles on them."],"Date Submitted":"03/19/2011 11:46 UTC","Region":"Louisiana","Case Number":"28316","Summary":"Two black circles against the \"Super Moon\"","Date of the Event":"03/19/2011 07:08 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28316.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28316_submitter_file1__super_moon_19march2011_two_black_objects_DSC00040.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28316.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
