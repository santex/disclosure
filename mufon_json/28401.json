Before the actual 5 second occurence, I also saw three craft, and in my perspective, these were small civilian aircraft often seen coming to and from our local small airports, nothing of extrateresstrial origin. These three craft flew from east to west and seemed to be an equal distance apart, going at the same speed across the sky and the green ball event happened within a few minutes after they flew by. This may help to exact my time of sighting. The ball also went from the south to north direction, but from my vantage point did not go as far as I30...Could be more than one ball that night?"],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Date of the Event":"03/23/2011 09:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/25/2011 08:38 UTC"}
