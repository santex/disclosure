These balls of light appear randomly and we observe them whenever we go out and night to look at the stars or when camping. The orange lights split apart, move in random directions and sometimes steak across the sky at tremendous speed with no sound at all. As many as 5 people have seen them at one time. The last time we saw them here was a few months ago when the children were camping in the back yard. A few minutes after the object went out of sight, 2 helicopters flew over very near us and they were nearly silent. The lead chopper turned on it's spotlight and aimed it somewhat in the direction of the area where we saw the ball of light. We have seen these things so many times over the years, we just look and don't get very excited or spooked about it anymore. We call it \"our UFO.\" I am fairly certain this is some sort of military PsyOps experiment or some other covert drone program."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"05/17/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-82.215123","Case Number":"42551","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.442115,+-82.215123(42551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42551) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/14/2012 04:48 UTC","Summary":"For years we have been seeing glowing balls of light over and near our property.
