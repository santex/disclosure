We viewed it on MEade Capture View binoculars and caught some video. I also took video with FlipCam which i will upload here. This lasted for two hours. It ascended slowly away from us. The object seemed part triangular and part round. The lights werent \"blinking\" but flashing rapidly from inside somehow. All colors of the spectrum. It made us wonder if it was using the light as energy. We saw four more ascending slowly awhile later although they seemed farther away from us. The colors flashing or spinning were red, blue, green, purple, aqua, yellow and I believe I saw orange too. I have never seen a star like this and I looked at other stars last night which did not compare so please don't think it was a star!! Other members in my family saw it too. We watched for hours."],"City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"33950","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"46.889092","Date of the Event":"12/09/2011 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Unknown","Log Number":"US-12102011-0011"}
