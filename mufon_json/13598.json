The stars were very bright and off to the southeast I see this one exceptionally bright star. As I watch it begins flashing these different colors almost in sequence. Blue, yellow, red then back to star-like white. I watched for 15 or 20 mins and all of a sudden it's gone. It never moved or at least I never saw it move to my knowledge."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.394214,+-118.537526(13598)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13598) map </A>"}
