A few of us were hanging out at my place on this warm summer evening, when I noticed this very large ball of light outside the balcony window, I yelled for every one to look at this thing. I had the presence of mind to remove the screen as not to ipede my view of the light and stuck my head out the window. Rolin, Fred and myself all had our heads through that window in seconds. That light zoomed away from us in the direction of the Pearson Airport silently and disappeared within 6-7 mins."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-01152007-0006","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around June 30th 1990"],"Case Number":"6166","Longitude":"-79.376114","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/30/1990 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"43.660186","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"A large spherical silent glow","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6166.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6166.html"],"Region":"Ontario","City":"Toronto","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.660186,+-79.376114(6166)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6166) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
