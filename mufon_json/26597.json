I pointed it out to my golf buddy but since it wasn't God he didn't pay much attention to it. I observed it on the 15th hole at Northmore Country Club on Grand Lake St Mary���s. This was tube or cigar shaped either white or silver. It had what appeared to be some red markings towards the front lower portion. The craft was low about as low as a single engine plane fly���s. It had no wings and no props and made no noise moving slowly or not at all. I had my club in my hand when I seen it took my shot and it was gone. I regret not watching it longer. I spend a lot of time looking up for something not really sure why. At this course I have observed a A-10 fly over and tip it's wing, I could see the pilot, 3 huge helicopters at one time that had to be military, several black helicopters at different times. I am very familiar with the skies around this course. This observation seems very similar to case number 26582."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.541019,+-84.490675(26597)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26597) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/15/2010 06:36 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Disposition":"IFO"}
