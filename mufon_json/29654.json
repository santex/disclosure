{"City":"San Francisco","Longitude":"-122.416496","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting in the garden looking up at the stars when a very low flight of 4 discs flew directly overhead SE to NW. Discs were low - size of a penny - and in a fluid formation. Bright white with a brownish outer rim glow. No navigation lights and moving very fast. Caught sight of them for 3-4 seconds before they were obscured by buildings. Height - < 1000ft (but maybe lower depending on object size) and silent. I fell out of my chair.
