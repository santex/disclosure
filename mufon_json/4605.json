We were listening to music at the time. Then, my dad pointed out a strange object above two towers. I thought the object was a tower when I first glanced at it. The object wasn't any tower, because the object was oval shaped and amber colored with a reddish tint. It just sat there in the sky. So I went to get my Ipod again to see if it did anything weird like the last time, but as soon as I turned around it was gone. My reaction was pretty stunned and we talked about it for awile. We lost sight of the object when it disappeared. My dad said he went over there a few days ago and said that where the object was (in between the towers) that there's nothing there."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.942984,+-87.145116(4605)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4605) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.942984","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4605.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"4605","Longitude":"-87.145116","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Rensselaer"}
