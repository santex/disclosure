I looked up to the sky like I normaly do to see if anything \"funny\" was going on in the sky. I am a firm beliver in ufos and always try to keep an eye to the sky. Well anyway I thought it was a star, but no, it was was moving. My dad said it might of been an airplane but the light was bright enough if would of made a sound being that low, there was also no blinking light like most planes have. So to compare it was about a little brighter then venus in the night sky and had moved across the sky in an exact arc and slowly dimmed out into the horizon. I also looked on nasa, there were a couple iss passings but according to the degrees and elevation listed it was alot lower then where the object was I saw and it was also too bright because the iss was about 800 miles north. So without a doubt I belive that this object was not from the earth."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.948816,+-90.36422(16077)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16077) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/17/2009 08:24 UTC","Summary":"Bright star-like object moving across sky at constant speed.","Latitude":"40.948816"}
