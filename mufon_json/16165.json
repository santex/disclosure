{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"41.619445","divs":["Sighting DetailsSOMETIME DURING THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF AUGUST IN 2009 BETWEEN 9 PM AND 9:45 PM, AN EXTREMELY FAST, PULSATING ORANGE ORB WAS SEEN AT 30 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON STRAIGHT WEST FROM MY BACKYARD IN PLAINFIELD MOVING WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED IN A NORTHEASTERLY MANNER. THE ORB PULSATED WITH A REDDISH-ORANGE COLOR AND DID NOT LOSE ALTITUDE NOR BREAK UP AT ANY TIME. SKIES WERE 25% OVERCAST WITH CUMULUS CLOUDS TO THE WEST. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE PULSATING LIGHT HAD A LONG FREQUENCY OF ABOUT 10 SECONDS THAT NEVER CHANGED. THE SPEED WAS SO FAST THAT IF I WENT INTO THE HOUSE FOR A CAMERA I WOULD HAVE LOST SIGHT OF IT. I WATCHED IT TILL IT DISAPPEARED TO THE NORTH. ALSO, PLANES ON APPROACH TO O'HARE AIRPORT TURN TO LINE UP WITH THE RUNWAY. THEIR AVERAGE SPEED APPEARS TO BE AT LEAST 150 MPH AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE CRAWLING. SO THE SPEED OF THE ORB SEEMED TO MOVE AT LEAST 950 MPH. THERE WAS NO SONIC BOOM OR ANY KIND OF NOISE. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING FROM YORKVILLE AND TO OVER CAROL STREAM."],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Plainfield","There were no other sightings in Plainfield on or around July 31st 2006"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-88.202869","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16165.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16165.html"],"Case Number":"16165","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Pulsating reddish-orange orb moving extremely fast in a northeasterly fashion.","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/31/2006 09:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/31/2006 09:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Plainfield","Log Number":"US-03222009-0003","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.619445,+-88.202869(16165)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16165) map </A>"}
