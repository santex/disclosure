I saw some good meteor showers. spotted one by a star around 12 am. the star seem to move. Thought I was crazy. so I stopped and stared at it. and it seem to hover in a circle. I immediately got my fianc��� to look at it to see if she seen the same thing to make sure I wasn't nuts. She seen it too and asked me what it was I said I don't know. than it faded out and came back on but kept moving in weird patterns. obviously very fast giving the high altitude it was at. She asked me if I thought it was a helicopter. I told her it was impossible. It moved way too fast. and the stop and start of this object was too fast. if I wasn't looking for meteors I would have never would have noticed it. was wondering if anyone else had seen this or if possibly the military had something going on around this time. is near the Lakewood base and McGuire base. also would like to know if anyone else spotted this. I really never seen anything like this and I am not a believer in ufos but I cannot explain this hoping someone has a explanation"],"Region":"New Jersey","Country":"United States"}
