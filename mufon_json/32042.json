The plane appeared to be approximately 1000 feet from the red light and followed along the entire time I watched. When I saw them, they were several miles away from my location. As i watched the red light, what looked like a meteor, like a streak of yellow-orange light, came from the left out of the dark sky, again like a meteor, and ended at the red light. The path of the \"meteor\" light did not waver. It was straight into the red light. I told a friend who was with me to look at it, and he saw the red light but was too late to see the light streak. We watched them slowly head S-W for approximately 5 more minutes until both the red light and the plane went below the roof lines of the near-by houses."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.558901,+-105.773667(32042)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32042) map </A>","Summary":"Moving red light being chased by plane (parallel).
