Number":"14147","divs":["sighting detailsit all started i was sitting in a restaurant at the maxim hotel and casino in las vegas nevada in 1981 a guy leans over to me and my wife and says do you believe in ufo.shis name was bob lazar and im like sure and he starts telling me about a place outside las vegas nevada called area 51 id never heard of this place and starts telling me he worked their and tells me about spacecraft that the feds have hidden in this area after an intence chat for 3 hours he gave me a map and asked if he could hide in our room as the feds were trying to kill him you know the story he said they had erased his identy and bob was trying to tell eveyone he said so it would be harder for the feds to kill him well just meeting this guy im like no you can;t come to our room i have one bit of info that you didnt see on the show on bob lazar this will make my story true he told me he had a bottle of fuel from the craft at area 51 and they wanted it back (them and they) had broken into many peoples houses bob knew trying to find it do i know where it is i cant say as im scared for my own life from this guy (the map got stolen from my house in nd )the map told me how to get their that night we drove out to the area (only on wednesday nights) he told us and we stopped in the desert in our van it was so dark you could not see your hand in front of your face it was about 10-20 miles from las vegas north on the interstate than go west we sat their in the dark for about 1 min and got freeked out and left it had the feeling like someone was watching us we never did see the craftbut we were close to the spot he said im sure you have heard all about this guy and i have seen the show on tv about himbob lazar years after this incounter with him after meeting him our lives were never the same as we found ourselves being followed not that we were looking for people folowing us but it just happened im here to tell ya that was weird cuz the guy that followed us was an albino i know it sounds crazy but its true and let me tell ya you notice an albino following you when you live in nd now years later we were driving from colorado almost home in nd a friend was driving my van and i said check out that weird light <zed thats my friends name being tired and grumpy from to many miles driveing said thats an antenna no i said its to high he argued with me he said i can see the tower coming down nows it;s 2 am and it;s not to far out in a field real dark and i said no it doing somthing over that farm house just than it did a 180 with lights blazing and i said see that ain;t no tower as we kept driving down the interstate at 2 am in north dakota at 25 below zero you can stop on the interstate cuz their just isn;t any cars so i said stop stop and as it got closer it got real big and it was not stopping getting closer i said go go than stop stop we than opened the van doors and got out on the highway as it went over totally a freek show for sure it was no higher than a crop sprayer ,maybe 500 feet so it was no star type sighting it went over us with a woosh and it was hugh it was like it wanted us to see it i had a pregnant wife in the van and the next thing we knew we lost 3-4 hours and we were standing on the highway watching it go away but it did go away totally it was up around 500-1000 feet totally silent and just watched us i;d turn on the van lights and the craft would back off just floating their it was round in the front with windows all across the front like a ship you see on the ocean and the back came to a tip so it was not totally a diamond cuz of the front windows but it looked like a diamond if you get what i mean we got back in the van and drove the last 10 miles home watching the sky and as we drove it followed us and flew down the golf course we were freeked out to the max it followed us home and sat outside the window to the south just hanging their watching us we got into the house and i hid behind the wall looking out the window and it just hung their even after day break you could see the star type light than it was gone it had a light on the front and a light on the back and it discuised itself as two stars but i could see the outline of the craft between the stars \\ lights one real werid thing was on the highway we all said we saw cars comming maybe two miles away and they never came and they never went by yet they were comming we all talked about that after it was over for days and now years my belief is that these craft belong to the feds they fly them around i believe they stole the technology from somewhere maybe roswell i don;t know but one thing is for sure when you see a craft like this your life will change and you will never be the same you cant go outside without watching the sky i actually bought a old farm house just to watch the sky the location of the sighting was mile mark 130 on interstate i-95 in north
