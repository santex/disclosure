We were on our fourth or fifth cocktail when all of a sudden we heard what we can only describe as an \"Earth Shattering Kaboom\" followed by seeing an object traveling low in the sky from west to east too rapidly to be an airplane. My friends assured me that I was not seeing things and that they too heard the loud \"kaboom\" noise. While we are confident that this event will be thoroughly investigated by your organization, we feel obligated to inform you that we have both video and photographic evidence of this event and we shall not be ignored. Thank you for your diligent work in solving these mysteries.
