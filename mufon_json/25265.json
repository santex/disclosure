Southern Oregon is not noted for many airplanes at night. In fact seeing 1 is uncommon, 2 is very rare. On this night we counted 5 roughly at the same time. 3 moving south, 2 of which at a high rate of speed, and 2 moving in an easterly direction. The 3 moving south and 1 of the easterly lights were obviously airplanes due to the straight line flight and the blinking lights. One of the easterly lights was farther away but obviously larger and brighter than all of the other lights. As we were watching it, we took our eyes off of it for 2 - 3 seconds to see where the other aircraft had went. When we looked back, it was gone. The sky was clear and devoid of any clouds. Temp was approx. 70 degrees."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.448677,+-123.319782(25265)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25265) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09022010-0002","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"25265","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
