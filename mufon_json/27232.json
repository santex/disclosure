the answer: there's no way i could have missed it! i got goose bumps and was a little freaked out. i called a couple of friends to tell them what had happened, but no one answered. so, i called my mom. i didn't touch it. i left it on the floor. i'll deal with it in the morning. i got up just after eight. it was gone. i live alone. i have no pets. the doors were locked."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"27232","Log Number":"US-01032011-0015","Latitude":"45.530772","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Summary":"Small object moving due South, made 90 degree turn, then another, then continued South.","Object Shape":"Cigar, Egg, Oval, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.530772,+-122.667557(27232)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27232) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/17/2010 01:53 UTC","City":"Portland","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
