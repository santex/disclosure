It seemed to be more than two air- craft flying in tight formation. It appeared in the western sky and traveled silently and swiftly going South. We could not see the shape of the aircraft as it was too far away. It seemed to decend slightly, while going southward, and disappeared behind trees and rooftops until we could no longer see it. The red lights on this were vivid, like the red of a stop light. The lights seemed to flutter back and forth in an almost strobe light effect. The aircraft was silent, and although traveling very fast, we heard no jet engins. These were not helicopters as they were completely silent, nor was it a commercial plane with steady beacon lights. We don't know what kind of aircraft it was-- some new, silent military plane they are taking out on manuvers maybe? This was a lot like the first sighting we had a few days ago of a similar aircraft with red lights on it."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"36.832258","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Red lights over Clovis, CA.","Date Submitted":"09/01/2010 04:58 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.832258,+-119.697529(25256)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25256) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"08/31/2010 12:00 UTC"}
