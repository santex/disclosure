However, they danced back & forth and up & down like gigantic fireflies about 3 to 5 miles west of my house, heading west along the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains, making no sounds. They flew back & forth, up & down like fireflies - no man made objects could maneuver like that. My 11 year old daughter, 26 year old step daughter and my wife also watched them for 10 minutes until they appeared to descend against the side of the foothills and the lights were gone. None of us have ever seen anything like it. They definitely were aircraft sized lights. It was too dark to take a photo."],"Date of the Event":"08/04/2009 10:12 UTC","City":"Rancho Cucamonga","Country":"United States"}
