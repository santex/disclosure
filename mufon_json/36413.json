I see a lot of air traffic and live in the woods away from town where every clear night reveals pristine skies. 10:30 looking in southern sky, miles away from the airport miles away but just above mountain line, a light brighter than anything in the sky catches my attention in an area of the sky where neither the moon, Jupiter, or Venus are - for they are 90 degrees west of said object. Bright pulsating light moving in a pendulum motion then disappeared after 4 minutes. Absolutely weird."],"Case Number":"36413","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
