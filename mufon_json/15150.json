{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIn Brazil, there is a city called Itatira in Ceara State. It's a city with 17.000 people. The entire city is in panic because there is a light since November 2008 following up the city people at night. There are more than 100 reports. People are afraid to leave their houses during the night time. Fishermen stopped to fish because they are in panic. The Brazilian Intelligence Agency is starting to research all the facts. A girl took a picture of the light that is following the people during the night time. I'm sending this picture for you attached. There are people saying to the newspapers that they got ill after they saw the light. So, that's a new case that needs to be searched."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Itatira","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-39.624623","Country":"Brazil","Latitude":"-4.527487","Object Shape":"Cylinder","City":"Itatira","Case Number":"15150","Summary":"Itatira City is in panic - Lights are following the population at night.","Date of the Event":"11/01/2008 09:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/01/2008 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-4.527487,+-39.624623(15150)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15150) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"BR-01272009-0004","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Ceara","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15150.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15150_submitter_file1__ITATIRAOVNI.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15150.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
