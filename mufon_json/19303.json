{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOut in front of my daughters home. look up and very bright light appears as close as a helicopter overhead. there was no sound as it moved directly north. then suddenly it turned on a dime to direct east. it traveled some distance and then just suddenly disappeared. there were no running lights of any kind. it just appeared to be an intensely white glow. I have never seen or ever expected to see something like this ever. but Me my wife my daughter my son in law and my youngest daughter all witnessed this together. my youngest daughter recorded the last seconds of this event on her cell phone video recorder. I have 47 years of experience looking into the sky, and have never not been able to identify everything I have ever seen.I cant explain this one."],"Date Submitted":"09/14/2009 12:18 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Coeur d'Alene","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Coeur d'Alene","There were no other sightings in Coeur d'Alene on or around September 13th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19303.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19303.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-116.772626","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"19303","Summary":"Bright light 90 degree couse change no sound very close disappeared.","Latitude":"47.681623","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Idaho","Log Number":"US-09142009-0002","Date of the Event":"09/13/2009 08:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.681623,+-116.772626(19303)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19303) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
