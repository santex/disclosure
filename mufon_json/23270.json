{"Latitude":"42.830556","Country":"United States","Case Number":"23270","divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and i went out for a walk from our home at 9:10 p.m. thursday may 13th 2010. we left the house and walked to the driveway where we have a clear view of the eastern sky. it was then that we saw an extrememly bright red\\orange sphere 1\\3 the size of a full moon moving very slowly in the sky directly in front of us. the object was on a straight line course sse and after approx. 1 minute changed to a se course until it eventually dissapeared from our view. the object did not make any sound and did not have any strobe beacons or landing lights. i work at a major airport and have a very good idea of what aircraft look like in flight. the night sky was partly cloudy but the object was not passing through them. shortly after the sighting a small single engine craft flew over us on a nne course and was intermittently obscured by the clouds. also the sound of the engine was clearly heard and the strobes clearly visible. to us this meant that the unknown object was flying below approx. 2000 feet and was not an aircraft of any type known to us. the object was moving at less than half the speed of the single engine craft. when i first saw the object my initial reaction was that it was a ufo. once we got over the excitement of the moment we continued on our walk. a block from the house we ran into a neighbor walking her dog. she appeared excited and asked if we had just seen something strange in the sky. she had described the exact object we had seen."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23270.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23270.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/13/2010 09:10 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Date Submitted":"05/14/2010 03:44 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Merrimac","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Red/orange sphere moving slowly","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Merrimac","Longitude":"-71.002778","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.830556,+-71.002778(23270)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23270) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05142010-0004","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Region":"Massachusetts"}
