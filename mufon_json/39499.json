My first thought was jet fighters with extremely large head lights. As they got closer they appeared to pulsate like fire and become larger but no sound. Then the one on the right arced to the right at a rapid speed. The one on the left began a sharp acr to the right as well. The one in the center made a fast sharp left turn. When that happened the other two stopped their direction and instantly resumed formation with the center one. As they headed in this new direction all three of their lights became faint and they disappeared over the tree line. These things travelled way faster than any plan in the sky and changed direction instantly. I called for anyone to look, my wife and son came out and saw the three as they began to fade."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Springfield","Latitude":"39.928755","Case Number":"39499","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"06/16/2012 09:45 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39499.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39499.html"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Summary":"Three bright lights zig zag through the sky","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.928755,+-75.362527(39499)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39499) map </A>","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
