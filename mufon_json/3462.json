It was hovering about 75-150 feet above me. It had 4 bright lights. 2 of which were blinking different colors. It made a whoaaaaaawlllllllll sound. Not too loud, but I could hear it. It hovered there for a bit, something like 25 seconds, then zoomed off northeast. I was outside for about an hour now waiting to catch something then I decided to report it. Thank you."],"Summary":"Not Provided","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","Latitude":"37.348576","Case Number":"3462","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.348576,+-121.888396(3462)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3462) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/20/2005 05:20 UTC","Tags":"City"}
