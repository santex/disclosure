As it came over my house, a little south of me, I noticed a star. The star seemed out of place because the sun had gone down but there was still some fant light. What I thought to be a star brightened up and started moving, slowly going east. It was about 35 - 40 degrees above the horizon, as it went east it very abruptly turned to the right heading south by southeast. It was still quite bright at this point, then faded and went south by southeast at a high rate of speed. I live under several flight paths, from all the airports and military bases. This object had no other lights or strobes, and traveled way to fast to be any of ours when it sped off. I lost site of it as it was too far away at this point. I was a little bumed, I wanted to see more. I always have and always will look to the skies!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Chula Vista","Summary":"Watching helicopter, noticed star moving then hovering then moving east, abruptly changed coarse moving sse, same altitude, brightened , high rate of speed","Log Number":"US-10312013-0012","Latitude":"32.62615","Date of the Event":"10/31/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California"}
