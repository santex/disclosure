It hovered like a helicopter but too high in the air to be one. We watched (clear night) and then suddenly it took off and vanished, literally vanished! Then within a few moments it came back in view and then a few moments later it took off and vanished again. We were driving and did look around the sky to see if we could see again but we didn't. It was definitely a flying machine of some sort and lightening fast. It must of had the capability to either travel at the speed of light or be invisible. I've heard rumors that the military bases around here have these anti-gravity craft...after seeing this, I believe it."],"Log Number":"US-02082012-0005","Region":"California","Latitude":"34.689343","Date Submitted":"02/08/2012 06:05 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Case Number":"35564","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
