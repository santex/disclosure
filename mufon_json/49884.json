I am guessing the object may have been one mile in the sky. object was southeast of me so I could not use the western sunset or moon to see outline of object. I was waiting to hear the regular jumbo jet sound but object was much quieter but had low rumble whole way. It took about one minute to fly from where I first noticed it until I lost sight of it going north toward St. Louis. I live 80 miles south of St. Louis. This is first time I ever seen anything like this. I have seen many large and small jets. I have never seen or heard a stealth bomber, but if I had to categorize it I would think that it would sound and look like that. Feelings were excitement and wonder. Like I said I have never seen anything like it before. If it happened to be a stealth bomber it was still a neat experience."],"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"08/15/2013 08:45 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
