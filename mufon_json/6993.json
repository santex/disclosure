Got my camcorder and filmed this","divs":["sighting detailsi had just came outside to have a cigarette. i saw this object slowly cruising over the building in front of me. it was moving too slow to be a plane and too fast to be a blimp. it made no noise. when first spotting this object i knew right away it was not conventional aircraft. it was strobing around it multicolored lights, just like in close encounters the movie. it looked like that game simon. i ran inside and grabbed my camcorder. when i came back out the object had shut off its multicolored lights and switched them to all white. the object creeped over just a few hundred feet off the ground above my yard. it moved from north to south directly above my street.the noise in the background halfway through is cars driving by. it was a friday night so alot of traffic on the main street next to mine. i am sorry i had the autofocus turned on, so filming the object became blurry towards the end. it comes back into focuus a couple times and has a strange shape to it. i didn't turn on the night vision till the very end. you can see when i turn it on. to me, it looks square. two bright lights in the back, two dimmer ones in the front. maybe strobing lights on either side? to me this is not a plane or blimp. life isn't scripted, this was reality so i was overly excited and hysterical while filming this. heres the livevideo link to it. i am having trouble sending the footage, i think the file is too big. http:\\\\www.livevideo.com\\video\\7945bba146f747678e0588001d08001c\\ufo-over-boardman-ohio-may-4-.aspx"],"Log Number":"US-05082007-0007","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ohio","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6993.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6993.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/04/2007 10:30 UTC","Longitude":"-82.905993","Latitude":"40.421187"}
