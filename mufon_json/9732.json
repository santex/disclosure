In just a minute or two, he ran in the door yelling for me to come outside and look at this. I immediately grabbed my glasses and went outside where he showed me an object flying very slowly west over hiway 377. It had three huge lights--a very bright white light and bright red and blue flashing lights. I then went in the house and called my teenage son to come out to see it. We all decided that it could not be a plane because it was flying too slow and it could not be a helicopter because it made no sound. My husband tried to snap a picture with a regular digital camera, but the camera was not made for great distance at night. The guys decided it was flying at around a half mile altitude. It was quite large to be that far away. We just watched it from our front yard untill a treeline blocked it from sight."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-98.599688","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9732.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9732.html"],"Latitude":"31.899089","Tags":"City"}
