Out of nowhere, ahead of us in the sky heading from east to west was a green fireball with a red tail. It traveled very fast, perhaps like an item entering the atmosphere, but usually things that fall from the sky do not have this type of coloring. Usually they are just the color of light. This was definitely green with a red tail, and it was moving fast. We looked to the west, expecting to see it hit or to see a flash, and saw nothing. We were not drinking, and are both 50 years old with good careers. Cathy thought it looked closer than I did. She thought it was closer to the ground, just over our heads. I didn't think it did."],"Latitude":"38.147844","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Festus","There were no other sightings in Festus on or around July 31st 2009"],"Date of the Event":"07/31/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18447","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/31/2009 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Green fireball with red tail going through sky to earth","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08022009-0012","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18447.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18447.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-90.328291","Source":"MUFON","City":"Festus"}
