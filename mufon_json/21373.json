The spheres were to the left of our vehicle and seemed pretty low and large up in the sky. The SUV in front on of us must have seen it too because it began swerving all over the road and kept changing turn signals. Then we saw one orange sphere at a much higher altitude flying at a high rate of speed, in southeast direction, followed by an airplane flying at a much slower speed. While sphere approached west horizon of mountains, blinked out of sight. The plane pursued it until then and flew in circles after it disappeared. My mother and I were very excited and amazed by the presence of the spheres. I was pretty sure they were ships and not made by our military."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-01062010-0005","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Region":"New Mexico","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Tularosa","There were no other sightings in Tularosa on or around January 5th 2010"],"Summary":"Brilliant glowing oranges spheres","Latitude":"33.073973"}
