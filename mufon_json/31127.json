I saw a bright white light about 20-30 feet above a neighbour���������s house. I first thought it was a plane, but it was silent and moving slowly towards my garden. I picked up my camera (NOKIA P100) and tried to take photos and video, but the camera isn't brilliant at night. I managed to take a few photos and a short, poor quality video. The object slowly and silently went above my garden towards my next door neighbour���������s rooftop it hovered occasionally and I managed to get a few stable photos, it seemed to be changing colour to orange. After a while the object disappeared behind my next door neighbour���������s rooftop. I felt great; I have seen a UFO in the late 70's early 80's and I have always watched the skies for others since then. The second object appeared roughly the same place as the first around 10:15pm on the same night, but at first this one was orange coloured. I took two photos and a video which lasts about 1 min 10 seconds. The photos are shaky as is the video, but you can get a rough idea of what the object looks like. To me it seemed as though it was pulsating bright orange colour and later it seemed to flash from orange to green and orange again. The object went over my neighbour���������s gardens \"maybe\" 500-600 feet high and eventually got too distant to see any more. I have submitted photographs and videos; the sound on the videos is my garden water feature."],"Longitude":"-1.478031","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Nuneaton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"GB-08242011-0005","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
