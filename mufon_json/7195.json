Then I saw it, a circular disk shaped object it was kind of shiny and was traveling approximately three times the speed of an airplane that later flew by, it was going west to east. Though I tried to point it out to my friend, he didn't see it. At first I thought it was a spot in my vision from the light but I then looked some where else and I didn't see it so I thought it must be a UFO. I didn't think much of it at the time. I lost sight of it after it disappeared into a cloud I then went inside with my friend to tell my dad and he told me to file this report so I did."],"Summary":"My friend and I where looking at the couds and I saw a circular disc object fly across the the sky and dissapear in the couds.","Date Submitted":"06/10/2007 08:10 UTC","Region":"Washington","City":"Washington","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Case Number":"7195","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7195.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7195.html"],"trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around June 10th 2007"],"Date of the Event":"06/10/2007 08:10 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.903492,+-77.034766(7195)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7195) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30"}
