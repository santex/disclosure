I asked him what he was looking at and he told me a very weird \"star\" or \"airplane\". I was lying down half asleep but after he said that I got up thinking it's just an airplane...well as I started to observe it we both noticed that the object was moving to slow and flying to low and to bright to be an airplane or helicopter. first it appeared star like then as it became closer it was CLEAR that it was a UFO!!! It sort of wobbled in a bobbing like motion and it hoovered with NO SOUND. When it got closer to the power lines I saw that it was cylinder shape, with black coating and red and white lights I also noticed that it had no lights like an airplane or helicopter this scared me to death!!!!I called the other kids in the apartment to witness what we had seen to make sure we were not crazy and everybody was pretty shaken. We live on the 3rd floor so our view was accurate. My son was so shocked he could not sleep for days. Now I watch the sky more everyday.. PEOPLE WE ARE NOT ALONE!!!!"],"Object Shape":"Cylinder","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"Undisclosed"}
