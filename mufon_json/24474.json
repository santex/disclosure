{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were testing out google skymaps on the droids as I walked my friends out to their car. Noticed large star-like object slightly west of Polaris moving moderately fast upwards in the sky about a foot by eye. It then stopped, became slightly harder to see for a second. The object then jetted to the west at a quicker speed until it disappeared over the horizon. Total visible time about ten seconds. It did not appear to be any plane, satellite, asteroid, or artificial cloud study of any kind. Both myself and my 2 friends witnessed this ufo. We have never seen anything like this before."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Stationary star like object, slightly west of Polaris, moves upwards northbound, then jets to the west.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/12/2010 11:37 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24474.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24474.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"24474","Latitude":"42.740061","City":"Warsaw","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"07/13/2010 01:40 UTC","Log Number":"US-07132010-0002","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Warsaw","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.740061,+-78.132788(24474)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24474) map </A>","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-78.132788"}
