I was sitting in my squad car along US 41 just north of Williamsport. I was watching traffic on the highway, when what looked like a ball of fire went over my car travleing in a north east direction. I thought it was an aircraft that was on fire. I waited a minute to see if was going to crash. It did not. I then call the Attica City car, and asked if they could see anything. They said that they were downtown, and could not see. I then heard a Tippicanoe County Sheriff car call and said that they could see somthing in the sky travling in a north east direction. A Carrol County car then reported the same thing. Shortly after that a Cass County reported the same thing. Years later (1984) while working (sheriff dept.) Myself and a resurve deputy saw the same thing at a town called West Lebanon. The object was moving in a northeast direction. I stopped my car and we got out and watched the object. I even made a motorest stop and get out an look with us. The object then disappeared in the clouds."],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Latitude":"40.294204","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9508","Log Number":"US-02092008-0004","City":"Attica","Date of the Event":"02/10/1976 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-87.248899","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Attica","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
