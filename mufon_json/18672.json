{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"49.152434","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["sighting detailsi was fishing with a group of friends in the tofino area we where trolling for salmon at the time, caught a 32lb fish ;d we made a break for lunch on a local beach after we docked the boat we went back to our campsite grabbed our bbq and surf boards and hung out on the beach for the rest of the afternoon surfing eating our freshly caught salmon had a fire and just hung out for the rest of the day and part of the night. that 'night' was a full moon so myself and my friend \"n\" decided we would surf throughout the night with the ocean being kind of illuminated we got some good waves in a couple nice wipe outs :d but for the most part it was fun now at around 11:00 - 12:00 not 100% sure what time it was just guessing i observed what i had thought was a 'satalight' joking i told \"n\" \"look a ufo\" he laughed said 'yeah nice satalight at this point we where still in the ocean in the 'lineup' and wernt really paying much attention to the sky we rode another wave in close to the beach i was getting sick of the cold ocean and bad wave breaks and we decided to go back to our camp site. once we where on the beach i was taking my leash off and felt compelled to look into the sky again and the 'satalight' we had thought was orbiting our planet was now 5 - 6 \"satalights\" with no color \\ shape that i could make out at the time because of the distance they where no longer orbiting i told \"n\" to look up he could not believe what he was seeing neither could i being curious i went into my bag that was laying on the beach took my flashlight out and started flashing at the \"craft\" satalight what ever all 5 or 6 of the craft completely vanished without any explanation and 1 appeared directly over the ocean infront of us i'm not talking \"quick movement\" hazy vision of the object i mean in the blink of an eye it went from a small cluster of weird [cms\\tg\\pd] in the sky to being directly in front of our faces i cannot explain to you how the object looked in terms that i truly understand all i can say is when it appeared infront of us where the waves where breaking over the ocean it looked like molten lava and was changing colors rapidly from an almost liquid magma red with tons of movment around the body of it to an almost white color overtime then it was almost blinding the only way i can explain it in the phase that it stayed after a few minutes of doing some weird [cms\\tg\\pd] when it appeared is the most shiny sliver metallic look i've ever seen in my life it looked like a ring polished to perfection. at this point \"n\" was telling me to run i told him to go to the campsite and grab the camera i ran into the tree line behind us scared for my life actually yelling at \"n\" saying \"grab the [cms\\tg\\pd] camera\" i kept watching this 'thing above the ocean' it couldent have been more than 300 ft from me \"n\" came running back saying i got the camera i got the camera, now what i'm about to tell you i'm going to assume that you are a legit research group mufon i've spent the last 2 months researching \"ufo\" space etc etc etc, not knowing what to do with what me and my friend came across and the footage \\ material we obtained being afraid and we'll the story and footage and thing that was given to us sounds and looks completely [cms\\tg\\pd] nuts =\\ we started recording this 'craft' walking back onto the beach and what happend next changed my life and everything i ever believed or thought was possible. i grabbed my flashlight and started flashing it at the craft again trying to get the attention of what ever the [cms\\tg\\pd] was above us we stood there filming for about 5 - 10 minutes and nothing happened then suddenly the craft that looked to me like something out of startrek and was giant in size opened on the right side of it and another small craft came flying out of it the noise the larger craft was making i can't explain it almost sounded like how a 'frequency' would sound i guess it was alien to me the noise it was making this 2nd craft that came out was the same shiny metallic silver as the larger one it approached us and hovered above the sand in front of us about 1 inch possibly off of the beach now this is where the story gets a little bit unbelievable but keep in mind we have good footage of this not a shaky blury image but actual footage of almost the entire event. a person came out of the 2nd craft and when i say person i mean human an actually person not one of these grey looking big eyed aliens people get 'abducted' bye or some martian looking thing it had eyes ears a nose feet hands etc the only difference was she had absolutely no hair what so ever it approached us \"n\" looked at me and said \"[cms\\tg\\pd] run\" i said no wait wait this person had facial expression i.e emotion etc she had looked just as afraid of us and confused as we where bye her, i looked at this person and said hello thinking possibly it speaks english me being completely nervous and not knowing what to say it then stoped about 3 - 4 feet in front of me and made a weird sound i don't know if she was trying to communicate or what but in any case it was really strange i held my hand out trying to show submission so she didn't think we where 'hostile' she felt my hand \\ arm her skin almost felt synthetic and she was cold really cold she then felt my hair and wetsuit made another noise and pointed at my flashlight with a 'confused' look on her face at this point i was no longer scared and when i say scared when this 'craft' came onto the beach and the one that hovered above the ocean arrived i can't explain the fear that came over me. its like nothing you will ever feel. i picked up the flashlight and she backed up a couple of feet i think she might have thought it was a weapon of some kind i threw it on the ground in front of her and she picked it up examined it and walked back to her 'ship' went inside of it we still stood there filming the hole time saying 'i cant believe my eyes etc' and my friend \"n\" you'll see in the film made a stupid comment saying 'think i could get with her' and i laughed she then came back out of the craft and the same way i gave her the flashlight she through something at my feet i picked it up she then came over and touched my arm again which was really creepy because of the texture of her skin and how cold and pale it was then went back to her craft 'docked' with the larger one and it disappeared again we sat on the beach for another hour or so trying to figure out what the [cms\\tg\\pd] to do with this circular object she gave us i still to this day have no clue what it is what its used for or anything it has what looks like math all over it and a few strange drawings and you can move it around like a rubik cube we where going to call the military but thought that was a bad idea then we where going to contact the media and send them this thing and the footage anon but thought that was a bad idea as well for the past few months i've had this video and this thing and i don't know what to do with it. please e-mail me back via [cms\\tg\\pid] and tell me what you think my best option is for this and if there's been anyone else with a similar experience i'm also contacting nasa and possibly the local tofino police thanks"],"Country":"Canada","Region":"British Columbia","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/09/2009 11:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/09/2009 11:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Tofino","There were no other sightings in Tofino on or around June 9th 2009"],"Log Number":"CA-08142009-0017","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18672.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18672.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Tofino","Tags":"City","Case Number":"18672","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.152434,+-125.902493(18672)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18672) map </A>","Longitude":"-125.902493","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Breath taking..."}
