Formed a half circle approximately seven miles in diameter. Calculation based on distance from each light. Had an extremely bright light, but when viewed from behind, was a miniature V shape, which the two back parts having white blinking lights, and a red blinking light in the front. Not commercial aircraft based on flight patterns and ability to stay in pattern with other three lights. Only four lights spotted. Lights disappeared one-by-one without any trace - they were not above my car at any time and could be viewed out any of the windows with no problem. Lights had ability to hover, which is impossible for commercial aircraft to accomplish, with the exception of the Stealth Blimp. However, after viewing the pattern, I came to the conclusion that the aircraft seen was not a Stealth Blimp - the characteristics were not the same."],"Object Shape":"Other, Unknown"}
