Was on an airplane flying from Tulsa, Okla to Florida. We left Tulsa mid morning. The plane had just leved out. Was taking pictures of the clouds below when I saw a light moving from the back of the plane to the front. This happened several times, There were 4 pics taken, 3 of the pics show lights 1 shows a ship like object convex shaped. The objects just took of from the away from the plane. It was moving faster then the plane.The people on the plane setting next to me looked at the pics and we were all kinda weirded out by the whole thing. There was anouther picture taken on my way to show a friend the pictures I had taken on the plane, the sun was sitting and I was taking pic of the sunset when I looked at the pic later, there was an object simular to what I had taken on the plane. We are in the process of getting a cord to download the pictures from the picture phone to the computer."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.158612","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4798.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/4798_submitter_file1__001ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4798.html"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Case Number":"4798","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.984695","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05192006-0002","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
