{"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"British Columbia","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy boyfriend and I stayed at Whistler, BC for a week. We were out on the deck looking at the night stars when we saw what seems to be a green beam blinking in the sky. It was sometimes faint and sometimes more visible. It appeared transparent, but whenever a cloud passed by, we see it blinking. After looking at it for 10 or so minutes, we noticed a grey stroke right above the Ursa major. The stroke looked like it aligned with the green beam, although they were not attached and were a distance from each other. After looking at it for about 30-40 minutes, we saw 2 more green beams blinking - one above and one far below. Again, they were only visible when clouds passed by. They were all aligned together, and if you connect the beams together, it would form a straight line. After about an hour, they all disappeared, including the grey stroke."],"Longitude":"-122.959423","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38024.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38024.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Summary":"3 green beams of light blinking over clouds","Latitude":"50.116168","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Whistler","There were no other sightings in Whistler on or around May 8th 2012"],"Object Features":"None","Country":"Canada","Log Number":"CA-05092012-0007","Case Number":"38024","Object Shape":"Cylinder","City":"Whistler","Date of the Event":"05/08/2012 11:11 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.116168,+-122.959423(38024)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38024) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/09/2012 04:02 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
