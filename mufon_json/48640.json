I was looking around to see if there were any more fireworks. It was then that I noticed a bright orange, low, steady light moving through the sky. I noticed it over the south side of the lake, moving northeast. As it came closer to me it faded almost instantly, off to the northeast. I was feeling since I first saw this, that it was a UFO who had come to observe the fireworks. It was huge and bright, unlike your typical flashing airplane light, and too large and low for a satellite, in my opinion. I was amazed that I was seeing this. The object merely faded into space. It seemed as if I should have kept seeing it, since it was so huge and bright. I mentioned it to my friend that did not see it. She agreed it was likely a UFO. I am amazed that there are similar reports of this in other states."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07052013-0016","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.340022,+-93.762228(48640)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48640) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Big Lake","There were no other sightings in Big Lake on or around July 4th 2013"],"Case Number":"48640","Region":"Minnesota","Longitude":"-93.762228","Summary":"This was a bright orange light moving steady through the sky, as low as a small plane would fly.","City":"Big Lake","Latitude":"45.340022","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 02:05 UTC","Country":"United States"}
