Turned down alley and saw what appeared to be embers from a fire in the sky I stopped car and listened for any sirens nothing it appeared to be a few blocks over coming up from house I was sure it was a house fire with embers floating up into the sky but when I noticed they were moving up down and side to side and one shot out of the group and flew at a very fast rate of speed to my right I knew this wasn't embers from a fire I got my cell phone out and tried to take pics but I was so nervous and the street light wouldn't allow my pics to come out I gave up and continued to watch my wife was with me she said I was nuts and made me get back in car she saw it to . So I got in my car went to gas station a few blocks from my house and kept looking in direction lights were coming from and still saw them I guess it went on for about 10 minutes its like they we flying up from the ground up into sky I felt excited that I actually witnessed it I am a knowledgeable person and could tell this was very unusual and haven't really talked about because you had to see it to believe it .
