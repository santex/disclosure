I was watching the movie Pirates of the Caribian: Dead man's Chest and at 1 hour 46 minutes and 43 seconds into the movie there's a scene where Keina Knightly as Elisabeth Swann is saying a phrase. In the sky behind her a object crosses the screen behind her until its cut from the scene three quarters across the screen. Has nothing to do with the plot or movie and maybe was not supposed to be noticed. I only noticed because I watched it on DVD and could rewind and think what the hell. May be nothing. Sorry if I am wasting your time. mike"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"bright spot in movie back ground sky not sci-fi movie ???????"}
