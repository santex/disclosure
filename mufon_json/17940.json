When I looked up and saw this ball of light just going across the sky. Was going in a perfectly straight line headed SE of Abilene Texas. It was very bright and pretty low. Thought at first maybe a sattellite but oddly enough like on cue their was a sattellite going across the sky in the same direction and this was much much smaller and dimmer than this light that I saw. It didn't change directions at all just went pretty fast but not super fast in a straight line till it got out of sight. Was about twice as bright as im gonna guess thats Jupiter in the sky in July."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17940.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17940.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/08/2009 06:07 UTC","City":"Abilene","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There were no other sightings in Abilene on or around July 8th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Ball Of Light","Log Number":"US-07082009-0012","Longitude":"-99.725564","Date of the Event":"07/08/2009 06:07 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
