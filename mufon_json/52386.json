Shortly after, it reappeared further on a straight path without any cloud cover in the sky that night. I watched while driving and it disappeared again and did not see it for another few minutes while driving. It then reappeared about 5 minutes later on my NE side further past a tree line, but noticeable and as I watched it changed from one yellow light to two yellow lights in a row and then very quickly became 4 yellow lights and then it was gone."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"52386","trends":[],"Country":"United States","Summary":"yellow light - looked like a meteor without a tail at first glance","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-72.570542","Latitude":"44.565523","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Vermont","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.565523,+-72.570542(52386)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52386) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52386.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52386.html"],"Log Number":"US-11232013-0005","Date Submitted":"11/23/2013 09:18 UTC"}
