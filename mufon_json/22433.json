{"Date Submitted":"03/22/2010 12:24 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsHi I was driving towards Roswell, New Mexico Saturday night from Spring Break vacation���about 200 miles west of Roswell (the city I was approaching before I saw the UFO was pretty big���it might���ve been Albuquerque���but don���t quote me on that)���when all of a sudden in the upper left hand corner of my windshield I saw an amber-colored orb. Right when I looked up at it it zipped across the sky, immediately stopped���as if inertia had no effect on it, zipped across the sky again, immediately stopped, zipped again across the sky and disappeared. When it zipped off into the distance the last time and disappeared, it had a light trail that followed behind it���similar to the warp FX in the original Star Trek TV series. I���m attaching a picture that I drew of the experience, labeled and everything."],"Date of the Event":"03/20/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"None","City":"Albuquerque","Log Number":"US-03222010-0002","Region":"New Mexico","Case Number":"22433","Latitude":"35.087011","Country":"United States","Summary":"Amber orb shoots across the night sky.","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22433.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22433_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22433.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.087011,+-106.648877(22433)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22433) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There was one other sighting in Albuquerque on or around March 20th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-106.648877","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
