There were lights in the sky but I couldn't capture on video. I made a second video but the light wasn't in it. This light looked like a star that moved from east to west then stopped suddenly and shine like a star, it never moved since then. The Object next to the moon I thought maybe lens flare but it moved and returned. After watching the video I realized the pulsating sound seem to coincide with the pulsations from the moon. Please let me know if you have seen the moon behave like this."],"Date Submitted":"06/22/2013 10:00 UTC","Summary":"It was green blue appeared diassapeared and reappeared","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"New York","Object Shape":"Circle"}
