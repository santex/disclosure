We observed this for over 2 hours and also observed several planes flying by the object. We noticed around 5 other object with only red and white lights moving just as slow, but they were at a much higher altitude. We watched planes fly around them also. We called some neighbors to go outside and observe them also. We didn't have a telescope to look through so used out binoculars, and could definately make out the different colored lights on each craft, and also see the definate flashing pattern of the lights. We quit watching after awhile because of the extreme cold. Each time we went out to look again, the crafts of objects were still there, they had just changed the place they were hovering."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.661486","Latitude":"45.638728"}
