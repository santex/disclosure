At one point, one of the smaller clouds appeared as if someone took an eraser and made a perfect mark in the middle of the cloud. In one picture you can see the mark in a cloud in which I just had described. There was no aircraft visible at this time. I've seen planes and helicopters fly through clouds before and never seen them leave a print like what I saw in the clouds on this particular day. Note the 3rd picture, in the lower part of the picture you can observe the cloud at there is a partial area that is looks like someone erased a little section perfectly."],"Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 10:19 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48701.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48701.html"],"Latitude":"41.614829"}
