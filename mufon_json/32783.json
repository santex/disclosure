{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking from my house to the bus stop around 6:45 in the morning, and I was with my brother. I looked up because I had this gut feeling. When I looked up, I saw this giant bright orb, hovering above me, and I stare it it, and then it shoots away so fast, I can barely understand what just happened. It was a really bright orb. My step-dad is a huge believer of UFO's and aliens, and he has had a couple of experiences with them, and so I am also a total believer as well. But as soon as I saw that, I freaked out and got really excited, and told my brother, and he doesn't believe me but whatever. I told almost all the people at my bus stop, and they thought I was just messing, but I wasn't... And I lost sight of the object because it shot across the sky, and disappeared."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-75.515548","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.063409,+-75.515548(32783)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32783) map </A>","Case Number":"32783","Log Number":"US-10222011-0010","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Paoli","There were no other sightings in Paoli on or around October 21st 2011"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Date Submitted":"10/22/2011 04:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.063409","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval, Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32783.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32783.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/21/2011 06:46 UTC","City":"Paoli","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"I was walking to the bus stop, and I looked up and saw this giant bright orb hovering, and then it shoots across the sky."}
