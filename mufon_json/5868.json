After the plane passed over, I spotted a star which defied the bright daylight in middle afternoon. It was around 3:15 p.m. in San Diego, CA. I thought it was a supernova. I was curious and grabbed a binocular to take a look. It was an extremely bright shaped sphere in stationary position for 15 minute or so. Afterwards, it went westerly direction fast until it disappeared in few minutes time. I judged it to be in very high attitude. I knew the \"metallic��� sphere was not a white weather balloon because it was lighted very brightly without producing any shadow made from the sun. The weather balloons can not interfere with heavy commercial flight patterns here regardless in low and high attitudes. It was not a satellite as no satellite can orbit earth in westerly direction. It was not a shooting star as I have seen them. There is something baffled with the lighted white object in stationary position and then moved fast. There were no blinking lights as planes are required to have them. Why lighted? I called it an UFO."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"5868","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"California","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:25:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.720019,+-117.153105(5868)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5868) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12042006-0001","Date Submitted":"12/02/2006 03:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 151 other sightings in San Diego","There were no other sightings in San Diego on or around December 2nd 2006"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
