{"Summary":"Repeated unknown events","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle, Other","Case Number":"19213","Region":"Tennessee","divs":["sighting detailsto whom it may concern: it has taken me 25 years to write this down in its entirety and share it with any one else.��� please forgive me if i ramble.��� i was sixteen years old.��� i had been up talking to a friend of mine on the phone and decided to go to bed.��� my mother and step-father and younger sister were already in bed asleep.��� we lived in a modest size single level rancher in tennessee. i went to sleep and was woken up at 12:34 (yes, i remember the exact time) by a painfully bright light outside of my window.��� i remember thinking to myself, \"oh great, drew (a boyfriend of mine at the time) has wrecked his stupid car in the yard...i'm gonna get in so much trouble\"...so i got up out of bed to go see what was going on.��� i pulled my hair back because it was just a mess and quietly opened my bedroom door.��� it was an old house and the floorboards creaked, doors popped, etc...so i had to be particularly cautious getting outside.��� i put my hand over the keys in the lock so they wouldn't make any noise when i turned them, and stepped out onto the back porch.��� the light was so bright it looked like daylight outside but i knew it wasn't.��� i opened the back door on the porch and started to step out onto the steps....but instead....i started rising up...very quickly...i was shocked...at first i couldn't understand what was going on...i looked down and could see my house and street getting smaller...i could feel the wind around me but (even though it was february) i wasn't cold. i also realized that for whatever reason, i was not scared. i saw my high school....everything.....then i realized i was over a nearby park....and looked up.��� there was an array of three lights tightly together, almost like stars, that i began ascending toward.��� the lights \"opened\" into a triangular shape and i seemed to pass through that interior space. i was in a room of sorts...it was a huge room.��� it was filled with people.��� humans. i could see....hundreds of them it seemed.��� they weren't afraid either.��� we all stood in lines and there were other people that seemed to be asking each one of the humans a question.��� just one question.��� i could hear voices responding....i knew my turn would be soon and i knew no one knew where i was.��� i saw, what i thought was a telephone laying on a shelf and stepped out of line and went to call my friend chris to tell him what was happening because i knew he would call my mom, and my other friends right away.��� a small woman, older looking than anyone i have ever seen before, came over to me and gently put her hand over mine and said i should \"put that down\" because \"it wasn't what i thought it was\".��� she was kind and gentle and led me back to my line. it was my turn at that moment.��� they asked me my question...i remember responding...then suddenly i felt like i was being sucked back down fast.....and was back in my room.��� where i fell on my bed and went into a very deep sleep.��� i never said a word about what happened to anyone....i knew that they would say i was crazy or something.��� so i kept it to myself. i have tried for 25 years to remember what my question was, what my answer was....and i can't ever seem to recall.��� i wouldn't even be writing now, if more had not happened to me in more recent history. when my daughter was 7 (i was 29) my second husband and i had a small apartment in an extremely rural area of tennessee that where he and i and my two children lived.��� it was attached to his sister's main house and was over a work shop.��� i was woken up, at 12:34 am...yes, i looked...and that is exactly the time it was...again, by a tremendous bright light shining in my second story apartment window.��� i tried to wake up my husband but i could not get him to rouse.��� i heard the door to our apartment open...i heard footsteps coming up to our living area from the workshop....i got up to see what was happening....as i came out of my bedroom, i heard the footsteps reach the top.��� i should have been looking at someone\\thing...but there was nothing.��� there were two or three large skylights in the apartment and i could clearly see the entire room. after a second or two of silence...i heard the steps go right in front of me, pass me and head toward my daughter's room.��� my eyes kept straining to see what they should be seeing...but i never \"saw\" anyone.��� i saw her door open...i ran...fast....through her door and into her room and said out loud...\"you stay away from my daughter!\".��� the light blinked out instantly.��� i was left standing there shaking and still seeing \"blue spots\" from the light.��� for the record...my daughter was not home that night...she had decided to spend the night with a friend of hers.��� her room was empty.������ the next morning, i went down to my sister-in-law's house for coffee...and casually asked her if her son had gotten home late that evening.��� she said no, he had been home all night.��� she asked me why, so i mentioned that i thought maybe someone had headlights or something and was trying to play a joke on me...and told her about hearing the footsteps.....she laughed...then said, \"oh! you saw the angels too!\".��� i was numb.��� i asked her what she meant....and she told me that she had a visit from something she decided was an \"angel\" that night around midnight....and that she has had those visits before.��� i excused myself from the conversation....i was feeling more than faint.��� it was the first time i had ever had anyone else verify an experience for me....it left me quite shaken. many years have passed.��� i am now 41. ��� i no longer live in tennessee.��� i live in maryland.��� i have only told two other people about this...my mother...and my husband.��� i have never breathed a word of it to my children or anyone else.��� a couple of months ago, my youngest child, who is 6, got up one morning and asked me what the bright light outside of his window was during the night.������ he said it was so bright it woke him up.��� my husband and i are exceptionally anxious...this time i didn't wake up....i really don't know what else to do.��� we deadbolt our doors and make sure our home is as secure as possible.��� but, i am not convinced there is really anything i can do to protect him. ��� i don't even know for sure there is anything to protect him from...��� i have a couple of loose theories but nothing that really adds up...i just really feel...alone.��� my experiences don't seem to be like others. i have read so many of these commercialized experiences of being abducted, etc.��� i do know several things for facts...1) i was not dreaming..nor was i suffering from \"sleep paralysis\" at any point.��� 2)��� this has apparently been going on for some time now....3) i am not crazy��� 4) no \"experiments\" have been done on me that i am aware of, 5) i have no \"traumatic\" memory of anything bad happening to me whatsoever, 6) there were no little gray people with big black eyes (although the woman that told me to put the item down was shorter than me and seemed extremely old...), and 7) i was not the only human being on that ....ship?��� i know other people have had this experience...i saw them having it.... i am just scared now...and i don't even know of what.��� i am sure you must get a million messages like this a day.��� i thank you for your time and if you do not have any answers, i understand.��� i don't have any either.��� i just desperately needed to tell someone about this... just...in case."],"City":"Chattanooga","Log Number":"US-09102009-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.05234,+-85.30428(19213)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19213) map
