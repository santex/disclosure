(i saw one once before in daylight in this same area in '87 or '88. that one was closer and the c-130s stopped their touch-n-goes until it passed.) i observed 6-8 spheres flying erratically. they just looped around individually with no apparent destination. kinda like a swarm of gnats. observed over a minute. they gathered and ascended toward a particular point and disappeared. then a straggler came from the south and rose to the same point and disappeared too. i don't know if they actually \"disappeared\" or just ascended out of sight very quickly. i suspect the latter. videotaped on iphone but they were too faint to appear on camera. i just felt surprised and excited."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"32.72196","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45397.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45397.html"]}
