Very far away but extremely bright fast blinking lights changing colors appears to skip across the sky. I saw several, about 4 come together over Route 42 AC expressway. Then A low flying aircraft flew above the tree line over my house, I couldn't make out the exact shape but the front was in a V shape with lights across it. I didn't hear much sound. It then flew and joined the other objects in the sky. The next night I went outside and saw 2 objects in the same spot as the night before but hovering lower to the ground and closer in distance to me. Ever since I have been scared and can't sleep.
