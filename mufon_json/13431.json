{"City":"Stephenville","Log Number":"US-10312008-0008","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsBetween 7:30 PM & 9:20 PM I saw six different occurences from white moving lights in pairs or flashing up to three & four. Speeds were easily 3X commercial aircraft. Also an orange flashing with mixed colors as referred to by someone else who also saw it in Case 13423. I also got it making a quick altitude adjustment. I have multiple photos, 10-15 sec. exposures off a tripod (Nikon D3 camera using a 200 MM lens), of all these. All taken last night from my place on the edge of Hico by Stephenville. Contact me. If you have investigators in the area they need to come see me."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"Numerous photos of rapid moving intermittent light, white & orange.","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"32.228246","Date of the Event":"10/30/2008 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/30/2008 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-98.199613","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were 5 other sightings in Stephenville on or around October 30th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13431.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13431.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"13431","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.228246,+-98.199613(13431)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13431) map </A>","Region":"Texas"}
