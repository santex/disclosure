I looked up and saw two very bright objects almost directly overhead. They appeared very star-like in their color and luminositiy. Around 80 degree above the horizon. They were traveling south by southwest. They were moving at the same speed. Just slightly faster than the speed a satellite will track across the sky. The brightest one was the most southern one. Their distance was (fully extend your arm above you, give the peace sign, the distance from index to middle finger was the distance seperating these objects). The flight charcteristcs were very similar to watching the ISS fly over. But I have never seen saltellites travel in a pair before, on the same trajectory and speed. In perfect formation. These lights were visible for around a minute and a half. I started my visual track when they were already almost directly overhead. Weird huh. If you have multiple witnesses or know what this is, please let me know."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","City":"right over colorado sprin"}
