I looked up at the stars as I usually do and observed a sphere of light, resembling a star in relative size, but which constantly and rapidly changed colors from red to blue to white, in no discernible pattern. I watched the object for approximately 30 minutes. At that point I came back inside with the \"star\" still in its place, more or less. It seemed to move but not go anywhere, if that makes sense. At that point I returned to the house, as I had seen these lights before, sometimes in greater numbers. I am still unsure as to what these lights are. I tried to take video of it, but as I only have a digital camera it just came out as a flickering pinpoint of light and does not do justice to what I saw. I came here hoping someone could give me a possible explanation to this phenomenon, whether it be mundane or not."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42354.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42354.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Georgia","Date Submitted":"09/07/2012 05:50 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-84.33739","Summary":"Multi colored light blinking and hovering.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.106185,+-84.33739(42354)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42354) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle"}
