My girlfriend and I were riding our bicycles around 2100 hours and had just turned around @ the dead end of our street. From what I remenber,for no reason I happened to turn my head to the left and looked up. There sitting above the telephone wires was a very long (dark gray or black in color)cigar shaped object which had colored lights on the bottom. There was no noise, not a sound. We just looked at each other and took off without looking back. We were so scared. When we got to my house, a cup of cocoa was in order. Cocoa fixes everything when you are a kid. I believe anything that one remembers for almost 50yrs, that scares the crap out of you, is factual and did occur. I will never forget this. I will be submitting two more sightings."],"Case Number":"8577","Log Number":"US-12082007-0008","Date Submitted":"08/31/1957 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Cigar shaped object with colored lights hovering above telephone wires","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
