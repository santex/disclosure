At first it was bright red and moving slowly from north to south. As we watched we could see that it was obviously not a flare as the altitude and speed remained constant. It appeared to hesitate occasionally but that could have been my imagination. It also made absolutely no sound. It slowly changed color from bright red to white and seamed to flicker or pulsate every 30 seconds or so. After approx. 4 minutes of slowly moving in a southerly direction it gradually faded away."],"Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Oregon","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Grants Pass","There were no other sightings in Grants Pass on or around July 4th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07052011-0016"}
