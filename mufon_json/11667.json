Please see attached photos and form your own opinion. It is a very small sphere in all of the photos except in the one photo. It did appear to be moving in a flight path over the cemetary. The first photo I took was of the Sacajawea cemetary sign as we were entering the parking lot. The object is in the distance to the left of the sign above the power poles. The next picture was of the three head stones and the object is to the right of the center headstone. It looks like a disc in this one. Much more pronounced. The next photo was of Sacajawea's headstone by it self, the object is to the left of the headstone just above the hill and further aware. The last photo is of Sacajawea's monument, if you look in the distance behind her you can see the sphere again to the left almost even with her right elbow. You will have to zoom in on these that was the only way that I discovered them. I dont know what this is but I do believe that this is a UFO. I am going to view the other photos that were taken by others that were with me. I did not see it while we were there. I realized that it was in the photo after we got home from vacation. If you do not get the photos please contact me and perhaps I can email them directly to an email address.
