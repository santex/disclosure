I thought nothing of it. In fact it took several looks at the photos while zooming in to notice this. I don't remember exactly when the photo was taken. I do remember however that is was taken in 2009. I did not see this object when looking directly at the cloud formation. I' not sure if it is another part of the cloud or something else. I just thought I make you folks aware that this is not the first photo of something unusual in the same general area of downtown kansas city. I will submit them also."],"City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"22363","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":[""],"Latitude":"37.972263"}
