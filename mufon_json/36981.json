We were driving north west on MD 175 between Fort Meade and MD 295 around 9:37 when I saw what I first thought was a low moving cloud. It was in the sky ahead and visible above the trees as it crossed the highway ahead. There was relatively no wind this morning, the trees were not blowing, nor did I observe any other swiftly moving clouds as one observes during blustery weather. It was just this one \"cloud\" object and it was moving from left to right across my field of vision. I had just enough time to register it visually, think, \"What the heck is that?\" when it disappeared behind the tree line to the right of the highway. I never recovered a visual off it. It was moving very swiftly and was almost the same color as the grey cloud cover. I am claiming it was a UFO, because it was an \"object\" it was \"flying\" and I could not identify it."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
