My wife and I both saw several redish-orange orbs in the sky, aprox 1500 ft. They were moving away, up the I-90 corridor. What got my attention as a inactive officer for the US Air Force, was the two jets in a circle observer pattern flying around the objects, one of each side, about a half mile away from the objects. It was clear that whatever these were, they were of interest to our military. This was around the old Medina Air Force base, which used to be a missile silo before it was annexed by Lackland."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-98.70072","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around March 25th 2012"],"Tags":"City","City":"San Antonio","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"03/25/2012 07:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"29.38009","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-03282012-0019","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.38009,+-98.70072(36970)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36970) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/28/2012 03:29 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown"}
