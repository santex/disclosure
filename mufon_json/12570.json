I was watching my clock.It was five minutes to two when I noticed it moving and five minutes after two am when It was gone.I. remember It was a very cold winter night.I always no matter what time it is look in the sky since i was a kid. And I am sure the moon is never where I saw it that night.That is why I took notice and observed what I did. I was completely shocked and figured no one would believe this.I'm not absolutely sure of the day but absolutely sure of every thing else.I got up to use the lavatory.Before returning to bed I stopped to look through the window.That is when I saw what I saw.I know it was not a full moon so I can only speculate what it may have been."]}
