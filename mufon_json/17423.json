These things are now following me. I have more than enough evidence to prove my wife and I are not crazy. Alot of this is the same as the aceti-orb phenomena. However occasionally like tonight there is something very unique about this 1 ufo I am seeing. I have only seen this type on 1 other occasion. It moves and evades like a jelly fish. Wnen we first spotted it we were going to MCDONALDS and to take some migraine medicine to friends. whatever it is it followed us home. Its over my house now this is normal in greer, sc. This town has been a hotbed since Jan., 6th, 2008.
