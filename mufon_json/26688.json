{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"BR-11212010-0006","divs":["sighting detailsi am an amateur astronomer. i was studying physics for three years and a half and i know the southern sky, where i live. that was my only sighting in my life and i never talked about it with anyone. i would like to report this sighting, because i found your site seriously. i was watching the sky with my small telescope with a 100-fold increase. that night they were visible to the west, mars, jupiter and the moon (half moon). at approximately 11 hours pm a little below the moon, a red object appeared, almost as bright as mars. i quickly pointed my telescope at the object and was amazed at what i saw. a huge hexagonal object with a jet red below it. the object was black, but you could see your way, because it was illuminated by sunlight. your speed was relatively slow and i could perfectly accompany him using the levers of the telescope. after a few minutes following the object, it has exactly opposite the moon, which gave me a reference to then calculate its size. follow the object for about one hour, and from a certain point i no longer needed to move the telescope. at that point i was looking at the object underneath. that was approximately in the region of formalhaut. the jet of energy emitted by this object was very different from anything i've ever seen in my life. it looked like a mix of \"flaring\" with laser light. on the following monday i called the astronomical observatory of campinas, and did not give me much attention. they asked me to describe the sighting eto in the end i say, \"what you saw was a weather balloon.\" honestly, i know a balloon. do not release balloons burst of energy, not hexagonal and not fly out of the atmosphere (so that the object was illuminated by sunlight). i then calculate the size of the object with the data i had on hand, i could calculate the minimum size of this object, and was surprised to reach the size of 17km (11 miles) from side to side. i would like you to get in touch with me and guide me on how best to publicize this sighting. much appreciated, *(wit's first name deleted--cms\\sg)."],"Country":"Brazil","Summary":"Not Provided","Object Features":"Other","City":"Campinas","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"26688","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Campinas","There were no other sightings in Campinas on or around September 2nd 1984","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"SÃ£o Paulo","Date of the Event":"09/02/1984 11:00 UTC","Longitude":"-47.060769","Latitude":"-22.898175","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"11/21/2010 06:36 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26688.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26688_submitter_file1__avistamento-1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26688_submitter_file2__avistamento-2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26688.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-22.898175,+-47.060769(26688)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26688) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other"}
