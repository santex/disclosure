The object was black and was shaped somewhat like a surf board, but rounded at both ends. In the middle, on each side, were two small triangular \"fins\" of equal size. I did not observe any lights. It was most definitely not a plane, blimp, helicopter or bird. It was moving in a straight trajectory. I did not know what it was, but could tell that whatever it was, it had been manufactured and was not natural. I assumed it was probably some sort of military plane. I was driving at about 75 mph so the object was only in my line of sight for a few seconds. Because of traffic I was unable to pull over quickly enough to see exactly where it went. I assume it remained on its flight path. At the speed it was flying, it would have likely been out of my visual range anyway if I had been able to pull over."],"Source":"MUFON"}
