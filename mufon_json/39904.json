Once I remembered there was no radio tower in the area, I slowed down and woke my wife in the passenger seat. I observed the light moving and pulled over to the side of the road to get photos. My video was full and I took a few photos. My wife observed that the lights all around the object were cylindrical and faced multiple directions. The object was traveling a easterly direction about the speed of a helicopter but without any sound or the usual blinking tail lights. It went out of view in about 2-3 minutes. The photos taken show multiple colors and appear more rounded than our observed triangular shape. They resemble something similar to the back view of the engines from the Millenium Falcon from Star Wars. Excited to have viewed and photographed a sighting."],"Summary":"Driving westbound 441, observed bright glowing redish object appearing triangular.
