He said at first he thought a car was coming down the street because of the rumble it made. Though he then saw the silouette against the evening sky and saw two lights on one side. He came and yelled for me to come see it before it was gone. I was watching t.v. in my bedroom. We ran out on our side porch and I saw the rear of the craft as it flew west. It seemed to me from the lights that were steady and the lights that were blinking that it was some kind of conventional craft but it was flying so low and slow it struck me as odd and my father was adament that it was triangle shaped. It also seemed flat to me as the lights I saw were in one line with no visible tail. It seems to me it could be a airforce plane that could be responsible for some triangle UFO sightings."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Wings"}
