{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my back porch looking at the sky when I noticed something that I thought might be an airplane, due to the airport being in that direction. The object I watched had a red light below a blue green light and sort of a white search light and moved from about 65 degrees to 75. degrees slightly zig-zag motion until it stopped in the sky when the white light became predominant. I looked to the right of the object and noticed that in a slightly curved line was 4 other star like objects.. One had a rotating white light with more of the red light in view. They were stationery in the sky. I looked around at the sky and noticed the sky was clear and the stars were visible except in the area where the objects were. I had to go in for a few minutes and when I returned, the objects were gone."],"trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Toledo","There were no other sightings in Toledo on or around August 10th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"I noticed a star like object moving in zig-zag motion in western sky moving eastward.","Log Number":"US-08112013-0026","Case Number":"49727","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.68321,+-83.568371(49727)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49727) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Region":"Ohio","Date Submitted":"08/11/2013 04:46 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/10/2013 11:05 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49727.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49727.html"],"Latitude":"41.68321","Longitude":"-83.568371","City":"Toledo"}
