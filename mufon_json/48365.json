The light was a soft white color and moved left to right and then dropped down and rose up again and vanished. I was scared and ran across the hall into my older sister's room for comfort. The next day I noticed a scab on the left side of my lower back. scar remains there after all these years, it is about 10 mm in size. I have only seen the scar in a mirror since I can't directly view this area of my back. I have no idea if this mark on my back has anything to do with the light I saw."],"Longitude":"-92.354829","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Arkansas","Case Number":"48365","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-06232013-0028","City":"Mabelvale","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48365.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48365.html"]}
