She opened the back door and saw a very large UFO hovering in the sky. She told me the next day that it was in the direction of the US Navy base Johnsville Naval Air Station. This is where the astrnauts trained for space missions. I call ed the Officer Of TheDay at Johnsville and he confirmed that there was an event the night before. I called the Northampton Township police dept. and they confirmed an event that prompted approx 500 calls of a sighting. I called the local newspapers and they would not comment on this.
