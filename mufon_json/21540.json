{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy Children were on our porch of our 2nd floor apartment. It is a perfectly clear day, and they both started yelling \"dad what is that?\". I looked to where they were pointing and observed a shiny metallic ball flying northeast, which would flash a bright neon red occasionally. It went out of our line of sight behind some pine trees about 100 yards from our location, and did not reappear on the other side. It was traveling quietly and very fast."],"Longitude":"-117.422867","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Spokane","There were no other sightings in Spokane on or around January 18th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Spokane","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"Silver ball flying in a straight line, alternating red flashes of light, no sound","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21540.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21540.html"],"Latitude":"47.66576","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/18/2010 11:15 UTC","Case Number":"21540","Date Submitted":"01/18/2010 02:24 UTC","Region":"Washington","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01182010-0004","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.66576,+-117.422867(21540)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21540) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
