I've had some \"sightings\" over the years but I could attribute most to aircraft from the Willow Grove AFB or other local airports. However, in 1998 I had an experience that I - to this day - cannot explain. I was in my living room, watching TV around 9 p.m. The house was very quiet, short of the TV. I started to feel a rumble that resembled the same feeling you get from a large woofer speaker with the bass turned up. Nothing in the house was moving, as you might expect from that type of vibration. I figured it was just a neighbor kid blasting his car stereo or something. Thing is, it went on for about 20 minutes. I finally got irritated and went outside to see what was going on. I stepped out the front door and the noise stopped instantly. Our neighborhood is pretty quiet so I just took a quick look, no longer hearing the noise I figured the kid had moved on. It was a beautiful November evening and all of the leaves were off of the trees. I stargazed for a few seconds and looked above our house to try and find the big dipper. I found something quite different. Above my house, maybe a few hundred feet, was a patch of sky the size of a football field which was completely blacked out. You could see the stars around it but the silhouette itself completely blacked out the background. There were, what I thought were, running lights around the shape, but there was no rhyme or reason to them ��� varying in intensity and color. The shape itself looked like a cross between a Stealth bomber and the front of the Concorde. It was absolutely massive and absolutely silent. It was alarming because of the sheer size of the object and the fact that it was moving so incredibly slow across the sky - I thought it was going to crash. I stood there watching it as it crept along the sky. Instead of crashing, it just glided silently and slowly above my home. I was dumbstruck. I watched it track from a west-southwest direction to east-northeast. Once it had moved, what appeared to be, a couple of miles from my home it sped up - quickly. Then it suddenly, literally vanished. I continued to stand there wondering what the heck had just happened. I went back into the house and the noise was gone. Ten years later, I'm still trying to come to grips with whatever that thing was."]}
