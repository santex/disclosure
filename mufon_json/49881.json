{"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"New Fairfield","Log Number":"US-08152013-0032","Summary":"High Altitude Object traveling South to North","Latitude":"41.505624","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsOver the past two years I have seen this same object at various times of the morning and night fly the same course, South to North from directly overhead of my location to approx 30deg. above the Eastern Horizon. During this sighting, I noticed that the object at one point became noticeably brighter for about three to four seconds. I believe this to be due to the \"craft\" being exposed to the sun. With the time and location it should be possible to estimate the altitude. I have seen several space objects over the years starting with Skylab and its nose cone to Shuttle sightings and the ISS. This object moved at a speed consistent with a space born object. Its course was smooth and perfectly straight. There were no navigation lights or any other lights other than the brightness of a bright star. Except for the 3 to 4 second period where the object became brighter the the brightness and color where consistent."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:03:15","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.505624,+-73.47124(49881)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49881) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in New Fairfield","There was one other sighting in New Fairfield on or around August 15th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49881.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49881.html"],"Longitude":"-73.47124","Date Submitted":"08/15/2013 09:53 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Connecticut","Date of the Event":"08/15/2013 09:29 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"49881"}
