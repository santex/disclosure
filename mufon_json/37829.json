I don't know what it is. When I leave home, I always look the sky to know if it will rain or not during the day. It wasn't moving, neither changing colors, it was static. After some time, it suddenly disappeared. I haven't seen anything \"known\" in the sky (airplanes, helicopters, etc) and neither heard sounds. My friend said me that he had seen a little flying object, moving very quickly and suddenly disappeared leaving that trail. I can't confirm it because I hadn't seen it. Attached are the photos that I took with my mobile. Sorry about my English, I don't speak English, only Portuguese. I only know a little about English."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"BR-04292012-0007","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-1.32956,+-48.39585(37829)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37829) map </A>","Date of the Event":"12/16/2011 07:08 UTC","Country":"Brazil"}
