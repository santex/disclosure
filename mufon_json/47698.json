We have 500 acres there and the night sky is so visible that we see lots of falling stars out there. I was facing north and saw what I thought was a star but realized when it blinked it must be a plane, although there were no red or green lights--just bright white. Then, all of a sudden it started descending like a falling star,but fell in a sort of arc, and was blinking intermittently during descent. As soon as it reached the horizon, it shot a perfect 90 degrees to west along horizon and was gone. The entire event was around 5 seconds."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Crockett","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Texas"}
