No aircraft i know can move up,down sideways zoom here & there. I observed it for 5 min with my sister on the phone. I noticed a helicoper was getting close to it but the object tried moving away from helicopter, the ufo finally started moving south in a swirly motion. I wonder if the traffic accident that happened at I17 & Thunderbird had anything to do with the object. Whats going on? there had to be tons of witnesses. Neat but scary"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=63.597593,+-154.488642(37430)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37430) map </A>"}
