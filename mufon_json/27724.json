I have seen on many nights while working, a very large object, high in the sky, that flashes brilliantly bright multi-colored lights. The object is always silent and other Officers are unsure of what it is. The object doesn't appear to be moving but ends up in different parts of the sky depending on the night. When compared to stars in the sky, it does not appear to be a star due the flashing of lights and does not appear to be a plane or helicopter. I first noticed it a year ago. It sometimes does not appear on clear sky nights. I attempted to take pictures and they did not develope."],"Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"41.408288","Date Submitted":"02/08/2011 09:01 UTC","Summary":"I have seen a non moving star-like object in the sky flashing bright lights for about a year now.","Country":"United States","Case Number":"27724","Date of the Event":"01/31/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.408288,+-74.316659(27724)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27724) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-74.316659","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27724.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27724.html"],"City":"Goshen"}
