I turned to her while talking and when I looked back up at jupiter we both saw two lights in the sky next to the planet. They looked like they were about the height that jets usually fly. They were close to eachother, one about an inch(and inch meaning from my perspective on the ground) above the other. The top light slowly moved up and dissapeared, and the second shortly followed it. They both were there for maybe a minute then gone. They appeared out of nowhere."],"trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There were no other sightings in Colorado Springs on or around October 3rd 2010"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25821","City":"Colorado Springs","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/11/2010 08:01 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Date of the Event":"10/03/2010 08:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10112010-0016","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25821.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25821.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.836222,+-104.817433(25821)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25821) map </A>"}
