{"Summary":"boomerang ufo night sighting","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was 0125 in the morning, I was at a friend's ,around a bonfire, there where four of us. The subject was UFOs and we've been talking about it for several hours. I got away from the rest of them, going to the bathroom, and all of a sudden, while looking up, I saw the object. Imediately I asked them to look up. This boomerang shaped UFO, appeared to be translucent, with sort of a white aura around it and few lights under it. One of the present was a Microsoft Flight Simulator afficcionado and he said that, after observing many aircrafts, he never saw something that big fly so low and so fast-paced as the object was. I don't know what else to add. Anyway, I'm available for any eventual questions thru my email.
