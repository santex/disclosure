I was crossing the street from playing cards with our neighbors and I always look up into the night sky and I saw a Royal blue light flashing from the East moving towards the west and I yelled out to my husband and neighbors to come out and see the flashing blue light. I then called yelled out for my son and called another neighbor out to see the flashing blue light. My husband called the police to report this sighting. We used two cell phones to record and also two digital cameras that recorded the object. We continued to monitor object and at times you can clearly see a three lights that form a triangle and then it would move in erratic motion the light would dim then it would get brighter appearing as a circle. We automatically thought it was a UFO because of the vivid Royal blue color. We lost the object in the clouds."],"Latitude":"33.147392","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.147392,+-117.162855(19976)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19976) map </A>","City":"San Marcos","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Triangle","Disposition":"IFO"}
