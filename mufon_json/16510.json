She is visiting our elderly great-grandmother down in Port Charlotte, Florida. At around 9:00 PM during a bad storm, two large orange triangle shaped objects were seen flying erratically over the Harbor, they were sighted looking south towards the city of Punta Gorda, they moved in very odd fashions which would be impossible for airplanes to replicate. She was talking to her Grandmother and I suppose casually looked over towards the harbor and saw these two very large orange triangular shaped objects, I'm not sure what she may have thought they were at first but they amazed her and she felt shocked at what she was seeing. She lost sight when I called to talk to her."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16510.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16510.html"],"Longitude":"-82.088085","Latitude":"26.983421","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.983421,+-82.088085(16510)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16510) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/14/2009 09:00 UTC","Summary":"2 large triangle shaped objects flying over Charlotte Harbor.","Case Number":"16510","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Port Charlotte","There were no other sightings in Port Charlotte on or around April 14th 2009"],"City":"Port Charlotte","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
