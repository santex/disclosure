{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving north bound on S. Vienna Ave approaching Moss Mill Rd, when I saw in the sky a Fireball of an oval shape that was red & orange with a tail that was of a lighter orange & red (meteorite?) it was following the direction of Moss Mill rd west bound. It was very dark out so you could not miss it. It was very cool! It also happened to be at the same location I had seen a ufo back in August of this year."],"Log Number":"US-11222009-0012","Country":"United States","Case Number":"20662","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20662.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20662.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.059924,+-74.399371(20662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20662) map </A>","Region":"New Jersey","Summary":"Red & Orange Oval Fireball with a tail","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-74.399371","Object Shape":"Fireball","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/22/2009 06:03 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.059924","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/21/2009 05:50 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
