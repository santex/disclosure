I thought, it is too big and bright to be Mars so I took binoculars to watch it closely. I decided to go inside again in order to charge the camera battery and take an astronomical telescope. It was not there when I came back. After the sighting I drove outside the city to take a few nigh sky photographs. Then I got to a pub where I told the story to some people."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"SK-01172010-0001","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/15/2010 06:30 UTC","Region":"ÃÂ½ilina Region","Latitude":"49.082982","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.082982,+19.612233(21525)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21525) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"Slovakia","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"reddish-orange stationary star-like object","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Liptovský Mikuláš","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"LiptovskÃÂ½ MikulÃÂ¡ÃÂ¡","Date Submitted":"01/17/2010 08:21 UTC"}
