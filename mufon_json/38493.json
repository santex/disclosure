I go outside every 2 or 3 hours to smoke a cigarette and always look up at the sky. When I saw it the first time a few weeks ago, I just thought it was a plane. But every night, usually around 11 PM - 1 AM, I'd go outside and the object would be in the same spot. I've gotten binoculars out and looked, and the object has red and green or blue lights that flash (not at the same time). I never lose sight of the object, it is always in the same area when I go out to smoke. Eventually I just go to bed. Then I saw on the KC news tonight someone had video and it was the same exact thing I've been seeing. I'm about a 4 hour drive away from there."],"trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"A stationary object with blinking red and green/blue lights"}
