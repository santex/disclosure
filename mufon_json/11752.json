{"City":"Melbourne","divs":["Sighting DetailsMother and I were driving south on US 1 to Barefoot Bay, Florida... on a return trip from Melbourne. We saw several lights in sky (perhaps as far as Cocoa Beach) moving from different directions. Once \"grouped\" they appeared to head south. Within minutes they were already what appeared to be as far as Miami. They were at high altitude and at first I thought it was a commercial plane. The speed heading south was tremendously fast. Very unsure about date of sighting. Was two or maybe three months ago.
