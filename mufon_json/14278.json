I was walking back to my car when caught a bright flicker in the corner of my vision coming from above. I happened to look up. I saw what appeared to be a glowing boomerang shaped object flying from the southeast to the northwest at 90 degrees to my location almost straight up. It was moving at a very high rate of speed, approximately twice as fast as a commercial airliner. There was no sound. I observed the object for about 1 to 2 seconds then it disappeared. At first I thought it was a plane and it could have been something military but because it disappeared, it was 'unidentifiable'."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.811104,+-122.264074(14278)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14278) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/05/2008 09:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Oakland","Log Number":"US-12072008-0010","Source":"MUFON"}
