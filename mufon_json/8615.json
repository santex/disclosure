The shape was that of a chevron and the material from which it was made appeared to glow a brilliant orange on the bottom and a light yellow on the top almost like the color of the sun. The vehicle appeared above the crest of what is known as Briggs Hill in Warren County. It was traveling at a very slow rate of speed in a NE direction towards Bowling Green and descending and decelerating at the same time. When it passed over my truck in which I already had stopped to observe it���s approach it was a mere 300feet and heading it's would have put it in a field some 900 feet from where I was parked. It vanished into the star field just as it passed over my truck. I believe at that point they observed my observing them and that is why the disappeared or should I say cloaked. My belief is that these vehicles are from earth most likely time travelers coming back to re engineer the past or simply to observe the past.Perhaps the survivors of WWIII."],"Case Number":"8615"}
