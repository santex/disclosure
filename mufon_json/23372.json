most residents of this tri-county area are routinely exposed to these exercises and see ch-46s, uh-60s, c-130s, f-16s, f-18s, etc, flying hard and low all over these parts at all times of the day. that���s normal flight traffic to me and expect it without warning night and day. is this ufo a top secret a\\c the us military is testing at night in around this airspace? maybe. are alien ufos visiting the wind turbines located in this area where i���ve calculated the lights\\craft to be orbiting (32.4229325564, -98.4531027856)? maybe. or is it the military's way of replacing the shuttle program... we wish! i have been procrastinating posting this sighting for several weeks, but lately have been motivated by one more sighting. this, most recent, sighting happened two nights ago, may 17, 2010, when my wife and i were enjoying the stars from outside our country home around 10pm or so. we were walking across the yard and we both noticed a bright amber colored light very low to the horizon, we both immediately thought it was a satellite or a weather balloon. the lights we were seeing were the same lights that i witnessed back in march. somehow we managed to miss the lights earlier due to our eyes being focused in the skies watching satellites pass over. we witnessed this sighting for about 2 minutes and as we began to get a better view from my hilltop it vanished. they'll be back... =)"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Thurber","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23372.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/23372_submitter_file1__ufo.sectionalmapcopy.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23372.html"],"Case Number":"23372","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.506599,+-98.418121(23372)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23372) map </A>","Object Shape":"Diamond, Triangle","Date of the Event":"03/04/2010 08:36 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Thurber","Latitude":"32.506599","Summary":"UFO was within 30 nm when noticed, traveling at slow speed with amber lighting s to n @ 20-25* above horizon - very large","Region":"Texas"}
