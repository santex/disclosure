One sun, the real sun was bigger, but there was a smaller one just as bright off to the left. It was the weirdest thing ever. I did get three pics of them. I expected to hear something about it on the news, but never did. Clearly other people had to see it, were driving down a highway. This is the first time I am talking about it."],"Region":"Michigan","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.215044","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-85.780943","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/03/2012 12:33 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/03/2011 06:30 UTC","Case Number":"40105","Log Number":"US-07032012-0012","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Mattawan","There was one other sighting in Mattawan on or around March 3rd 2011","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""]}
