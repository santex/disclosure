California...the other night 8-11-07 my daughters and I were outside about 10:30 p.m. waiting for the meteor shower, and all noticed a small light it the sky...looking like a dim version of the Space Station...(in witch we all keep track of)...except it was moving from North to South...the Station always moves from West to East...anyway we noticed it got bright then dimmer then bright then dim as if it possibly was spinning...but then it did something that I never saw before...it parked itself at about 75 degrees in the Southern sky...now I have been involved with Astronomy for many years ,and but like I said I have never seen anything like that before...the question I have is ...do \"we\" have the ability to move and park a satellite anywhere in the sky..."],"Date of the Event":"08/11/2007 10:30 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
