{"divs":["Sighting DetailsFIrst off, NC, you are not crazy nor does it sound like you had sleep paralysis. The Texas person sounds like they no nothing about what happens to someone when they are abducted or refuse to believe the unbelievable, therefore they deny. David M. Jacobs, Ph.D, author of \"SECRET LIFE,Firsthand accounts of UFO Abductions,published in 1992,Simon & Shuster, is an excellent book to read \"Texas\". NC is having the same exact experiences that 300 other abductees in this book & have been having for at least 40 yrs. Sound like a coincidence? I think not. Hang in there NC & hopefully one day we will ALL find out the truth."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Oklahoma","trends":[],"Latitude":"35.009282","Summary":"In Response to Abducted in NC/ Texas respondee","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/07/2008 03:35 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","Date of the Event":"12/07/2008 03:35 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.009282,+-97.085067(14281)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14281) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12072008-0012","Case Number":"14281","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-97.085067","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14281.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14281.html"]}
