He went outside with our digital camera to take a picture of the full moon, just about 5 dgrees above the hoirzon, sitting onthe tailgate of my pickup. He looed over toward the house ( about 20 feet away ) and seen thse lights just sitting there. He says it was not moving. Thiking it looked kind of neat, he took a picture, the flash went off, and he object dissapeared. He says he didn't even see it move. I wish he would have called me out of the house when he seen this, I would have tried to get a better picture. So I did not see this myself, just the picture on the camera. It appears to be a boomerang shape. In the photo you can see the peak of the garage roof.If the photo don't go through let me know. Don't have a clue what this is. It seems like I have seen similar photos on some of the UFO programs that I have watched on TV. As I said, I did not get to see this myself,my grandson is the one who seen it and took the pictue, he is 14 years old.
