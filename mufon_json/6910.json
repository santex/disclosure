To the naked eye you couldn't see the dark circle inside of it. I was at work at the time. I took the picture because I like taking pictures of clouds and this was an unusual shape and low. I'd say about 50 to 100 feet above the park and it just floated there. I went back to work and it was gone when I looked back. So when I went home I downloaded the picture in my computer, it came out with a dark circle on the inside of it. Have no clue what it is, why it is like it is. Maybe it's a vortex, wormhole or something."],"Country":"United States","City":"Allentown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/07/2006 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6910.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6910_submitter_file1__UFOoverTrexlerpark.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6910.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON"}
