They were orbs colored in blue, green and yellow. They were beautiful. They levitated, formed a circle around me, colored titanium white and began to circle me counter clockwise rapidly. They came into my body around my waist. The next thing I knew they were leaving through the closed window and turned back into orbs. While playing with them I felt joy, safe, as though they were familiar to me. When they left, I felt heartbroken. I knew I would never see them again. I am missing time from this event. I want to know what they are, and what happened to me."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"-67.840232","Summary":"They came to me in my crib, let me play with them until they left, missing time.","Region":"Maine","City":"Houlton","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"46854","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46854.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46854.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Houlton","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
