It was close to the brightest object in the sky, within 30 seconds it had traveled an unbelievable distance, I swear It was moving faster than anything I've ever seen and it seemed to side swipe another object in the sky when it did I could see a type of vapor kind of like a heat wave. It kept moving a few more seconds then disappeared. It did not look like it was falling, it was amazing. Kevin Burris"]}
