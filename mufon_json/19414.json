Called all adults over to look as I was in shock to see it. Three of our children were close by and also saw the same exact thing and came running to tell us. It dissappeared. called the local police and news station to report. We all drew pictures to have it fresh in our minds. The object was nothing definable as far as a plane , comet or satelite. The area lit up was too large to describe. The light was stationary while we were observing it. We all drew pictures to preserve our impressions. Cloudless sky but the illumination looked like glowing clouds. Four adults and three teenagers saw the exact same thing."],"Country":"United States"}
