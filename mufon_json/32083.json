I set up my home security camara pointed to the sky to maybe film the satelite that was suppose to break up on re-entry . The next morning I played back everything on the video and there we're ufo's zipping by from around 1:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. So cool ! Well this was the last one and I think the best one too . Hope you like it friends !"]}
