Around 2am I went outside our tent to use the restroom. I was star gazing for a few moments and noticed one of the \"stars\" was moving slightly. I rubbed my eyes and cleaned my glasses and watched for a good 5 minutes. While intensely viewing the star I quickly began noticing two separate faint blue lights flashing in and out in an orbit like way around the \"star\". Yet, the slight movement of the start that that originally caught my eye was in fact darting towards each flash of faint blue light. I witnessed this for several minutes before going back to the tent. The \"star\" was extremely high in the sky, perhaps in space itself or the upper atmosphere. For as high as the light objects were I believe that the slight movements the star made towards the blue lights must have been extremely fast, as it was moving back and forth, stopping, and then shifting toward another blue light repeatedly."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31260.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31260.html"],"Latitude":"37.95143","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"31260","Region":"Missouri","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.95143,+-91.771269(31260)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31260) map </A>","Longitude":"-91.771269","Summary":"Star-like object with two faint blue lights moving together.","Log Number":"US-08282011-0025","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/28/2011 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Rolla","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Other","Date Submitted":"08/28/2011 10:01 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like"}
