I could barley make it out at first, but as it got more over head I could see that it was a boomerang shaped object, moving very fast, made no noise and there were no visable lights. I watched this object as it headed towards the east until I lost sight of it, the whole thing lasted about 10-15 seconds. afterwords I tried to figure out what I had just seen and couldnt come up with anything other than a UFO."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"Dimley lit bomerang shaped object traveling at a high rate of speed to the east.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8173.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8173.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/20/2007 02:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-89.588986","Latitude":"40.693649","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Peoria","There were no other sightings in Peoria on or around October 20th 2007"],"City":"Peoria","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Date of the Event":"10/20/2007 02:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"8173","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois"}
