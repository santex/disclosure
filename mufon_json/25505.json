The area is rural that we were leaving coming into Lake Cities outer boundaries an orange sphere about the size of a softball flashed from one field to the other as it crossed the road in front of us maybe some 300 feet ahead, the velocity was faster then a bullet and it had an orange tinge to it, it traveled parallel to the ground at about headlight height on the car. We both looked to each other to confirm that we had both seen it, when we went to look at which way it went it was nowhere in sight. I asked what the hell was that and my buddy said nothing from this world, we got the heck out of there as it scared both of us a good deal."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Lake City","There were no other sightings in Lake City on or around September 20th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Longitude":"-82.63196","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"30.199366","City":"Lake City"}
