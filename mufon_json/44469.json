I stopped my truck and grabbed my cell phone. She ran in house to get hers. We watched it slowly moving just above school and then it stopped, completely turned aeound and went back another direction. It seemed to know we were watching it. I tried to video tape and take pictures my phone went black. I got none. My daughter took pictures and hers turned out nothing but static. We live close to a air force base and we see alot of planes day and night but this didn't look or act like anyxplane either of us has seen before.
