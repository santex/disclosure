I went outside, and very low on the horizon, in the trees and just above and below the hills from my house was a flashing light. It was too low and too obscured by trees and hills to see, but it was a light of some sort at the same time my TV had brief interference. I could only barely see the light moving west for about 7 seconds - couldn���t see it well enough to say if it was a plane, etc. But no noise."],"Latitude":"32.682531","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Receding light, TV interrupted","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Silver City","There were no other sightings in Silver City on or around July 25th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Longitude":"-108.452334","Log Number":"US-07272009-0017","Region":"New Mexico","City":"Silver City","Case Number":"18354","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18354.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18354.html"]}
