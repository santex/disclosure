They are not red like what we saw with our own eyes ,they are a bright yellow ball of light.In one of our pictures there is a star with the object and you can see the difference between the two.There is also refeerence to trees and the objects in the picturesas well. It was just to wierd for us to be the only ones to see these objects."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Michigan","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"42.655635","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/12/2012 10:59 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Utica","There were no other sightings in Utica on or around September 11th 2012"],"City":"Utica","Log Number":"US-09122012-0006","Summary":"My wife and I took pictures of evet on cellphone","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/11/2012 10:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42502.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42502.html"],"Case Number":"42502","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
