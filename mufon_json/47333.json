{"Case Number":"47333","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/10/2013 08:09 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn May 4, 2013, my wife and I were sitting in our backyard. At around 4:40 PM I noticed a bright flashing light to the East of us as it came over a hill. The light was flashing as if a mirror was reflecting a very bright light. The light was on the side away from the sun. As it approached it appeared to be a sphere. The object travelled from the NE to SW. It was difficult to make out because of the flashing light. When it travelled further and I was looking at it almost from the rear, it looked like a solid grey sphere. At first I thought it might be a balloon, however it did not bob or waver and the light was stronger than any strobe I have seen in the daytime. I could not tell the size - there were no clouds, but it was well below some jet contrails that had recently formed. We both saw the object and it was like nothing we had seen before. I wanted to get a camera but there was no time. I was mostly curious during the event, just trying to figure out what it was. The object kept travelling on a straight line NE to SW until it disappeared from sight."],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"sitting in backyard noticed a grey sphere with flashing light pass NE to SW","Longitude":"-75.359678","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-05102013-0026","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/04/2013 04:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.081125,+-75.359678(47333)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47333) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"Clinton","Region":"New York","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Clinton","There were no other sightings in Clinton on or around May 4th 2013"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.081125","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47333.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47333.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
