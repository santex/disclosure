Each night about 9pm while watching the stars we started to see orange lights appear. Sometimes the lights would split into two, one traveling east and climbing to a higher altitude then disapearing while the other staied fixed on the horizon and disapearing at the same time the other one did. Sometimes the lites would apear and then fade out. On several occasion we would hear jets flying out over head. Knowing of the Air Force bases close by we didn't know if there were military excersizes out over the gulf or were they chasing the lights. The lights looked like orange flares but traveled horazontaly and climbed never falling to earth as flares do."],"Longitude":"-84.981154","Region":"Florida","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.728368,+-84.981154(16150)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16150) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/17/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"16150","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"29.728368","Tags":"City","City":"Apalachicola","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
