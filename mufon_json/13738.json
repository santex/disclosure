It was in February, 2007 at approximately 2-2:30 a.m. There was snow on the ground and I remember bright conditions, like moonlight reflecting off the snow making the night seem lighter than normal for that time of night. I was driving south on I-77, just north of the Pleasant Valley Road exit. My car window was cracked open because I am a smoker and I was flicking ashes out the window. I had the car radio on, but it was not turned up loud and there was no music on---my habit at that time of night was to listen to talk radio. There were not many cars on the highway with me and I do not remember any cars near me traveling in my direction close to me. I was focused up ahead as I was nearing the exit. There were fairly dense trees to my right off the road. I sensed movement overhead and looked up through my front windshield and just slightly to my right. I saw a huge dark triangular shape with red non-blinking lights gliding silently over the treetops, traveling north but almost as if it were following I-77 northbound (but next to the southbound lanes). (My memory is a little fuzzy about the color of the lights---at times I see red lights in my memory, and at times I see white lights). It was not directly overhead, but no more than maybe 20-30 feet to my right. I could clearly see the outline of the craft and remember thinking it was not an airplane. I also made note of the fact that the lights were solid and not blinking. I put my window all the way down and could not hear anything---it was completely silent. I estimate the craft to be about 100 yards across at the widest part. It was clearly outlined against the moonlit sky. It did not look metallic from my angle; I had the sense that it was black. I turned my attention to the road ahead and drove as quickly as I could to the curving exit ramp. As I came around the curve of the ramp, I was going to end up facing north. I looked in the direction I had seen the craft and (as large as it was) I expected to see the back end of it. I could not locate the craft again and assumed the tree tops were in my way. I looked in the paper and online after my sighting, hoping to see reports of other sightings, but I found nothing. For a long time I just felt satisfied that I knew what I saw and it was nothing I had ever seen. After almost 2 years, I���ve decided I want to report my sighting to SOMEONE just so my sighting is documented somewhere. I���m not saying it was extraterrestrial, but it definitely was a UFO because I could not identify it, it was definitely flying, and it was an object. Could it have been a stealth bomber? My instincts tell me that a stealth bomber is not 100 yards wide, but I have no idea."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","City":"Independence","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.368664,+-81.637903(13738)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13738) map </A>"}
