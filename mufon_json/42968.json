I was sitting down on second floor balconey looking up at trees and birds then in a small spot of clearing between house and tree i saw something zip buy that didnt seem bird like...then another and another i guess i can honestly count like 15+ of these....SO i went down to get some friends to look and whatever came buy was gone ....UGH ....i then went in and thoght ill go have another look sat for a few minutes and sure enough 3-5 of them in the nearly identical path zipped buy and one slowed and sat in a cloud so well that if you didnt see it slow and stop you would never see it.... awful high up i gather and they were silver and at front of each of these appears to ahve been some tiny spec a black... Peterborough ontario and from what me and others discussed it may have happened over the airport....none of these i can tell had wings... OH one other odd thing i noticed was there were tons a seaguls and other birds flapping around at differing heights and when these orbs weren't around the birds weren't either.... ( just to add these were spherical and you where a silver shiny surface and every one of these orbs had some pointy black bit on one side the direction they were going and each followed the exact path except the second sitting later on... where one slowed moved up into a position near a cloud and stayed there for a few minutes the cloud enveloped it and that was last i saw of them )"],"Country":"Canada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42968.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42968.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Peterborough","Region":"Ontario","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"sitting on 2nd sotry balconey , i looked up and up near clouds i could see lil siver bals with a black front zip buy , later 4 came back and one hovered near a cloud","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.304369,+-78.322725(42968)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42968) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"44.304369","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Log Number":"CA-10022012-0006","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Peterborough","There were no other sightings in Peterborough on or around October 1st 2012"],"Case Number":"42968","Date Submitted":"10/02/2012 11:41 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Longitude":"-78.322725","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
