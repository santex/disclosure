I stopped my car on the side of the road and watched it for a few minutes thinking it was a Chinese lantern. It moved steadily across the sky headed East directly behind me. I realized it was too big to be a Chinese Lantern. I noticed no blinking lights or noise. Cars were passing by me headed South so I know they must have seen the object as well. I got out of my car and took two pictures. I've got two pictures, but am only able to download one at this time as my battery on my phone is dead and I don't have my charger."]}
