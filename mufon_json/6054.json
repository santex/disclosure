So when I found out alot of precise good info I started to spread the word about them . Which stop my friends from talking to me and everyone not believing me.Finally I was at a good friends house the only one I had, and we had seen two orbs off in the distance appear and then disappear, from then on I increased my study on them , a couple of days ago I was at his house again . We were looking out his new telescope I bought him for christmas when his stepdad a non-believer said why don't u look at the bright star over there . I said that star appeared there seconds ago then all the sudden u hear him say holy Sh*t did u see that thing shoot up in the sky and disappear i looked at the star and notice it wasn't there . Me and my friend said now do u believe us , he said well I know that wasn't an airplane. A few days later my sisters' boyfriend was outside with my stepdad , I heard them yelling for everyone to come hear fast, I finally ran out and seen 4-5 orbs zooming over our house in the sky . Well there was a ufo reporting on Fox 13 news saying a ufo was in chicago. I called up my sister in law ,summer and had my family tell her the truth there was ufo's over my house I told everyone thats why I research them because they are real.After everyone went inside I was still talking to her outside looking at them. They changed from white to purple.She told me this may be a sign to me . I told her everything about my other sightings and how I don't know why i'm researching them. It's weird I start researching them and they show up over my house . I really don't know why this happened but I hope u could tell me. I know I wrote stuff that doesn't concern the ufo's but I need an answer I have weird feelings now and I don't know if I should keep going on with my research . But I do know 2007 will bring great things for me and the ufo and Extraterrestrial researchers .Thankyou I hope i will get an answer.I'm 18 by the way and my family agreed to let me tell you about this . Good luck on finding the truth and spreading the news or do u already know the truth but have trouble on spreading it."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/02/2007 07:25 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/02/2007 07:25 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.483168,+-82.536987(6054)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6054) map </A>"}
