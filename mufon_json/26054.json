My wife just closed her eyes and I was just staring out front window, which faces south east. A bright bluish whitish irregular shaped orb \"slowly\" moved its way across my view, then seemingly exploded lighting up the entire sky. Absolutely no noise could be heard. Object was traveling much slower than a meteorite, and seemed to be traveling horizontally. I'd put it about 45 degrees above horizon. I was sort of confused by what I was seeing and by the time my wife had opened her eyes, the eent was well over."],"trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Harrison","There were no other sightings in Harrison on or around October 23rd 2010"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26054.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26054.html"],"City":"Harrison","Object Features":"None"}
