There was a full moon with a large bank of clouds between me and it. The clouds were very bright. I was suddenly startled by the appearance of a black triangle moving to the NE. I bolted to my feet saying what the heck was that. I never told anyone as I had never heard the words \"black triangle\". About a month ago I decided to google the words black triangle. To my surprise there were pages of information. I was relived that I wasn't alone with this experience. Sincerely, Kevin J Murphy Ph.D. PS: Not sure on date as I made no attempt to remember."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.788553","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Cranston","There were no other sightings in Cranston on or around August 15th 2009"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Black triangle came out of the south and flew north east.","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.788553,+-71.43498(21795)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21795) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
