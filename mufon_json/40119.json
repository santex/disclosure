The photo is completely original. The photo was taken in a westerly direction at the beach at Oceanside Harbor, Oceanside, CA. The black line attracted my attention because it was completly straight in spite of what looks like high altitude winds affecting the white vapor trails from, what looks like, rocket trails fired from Norton AFB. What ever it was appears to be above the weather. I'd love to know what is was."],"Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40119.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40119.html"],"Tags":"City"}
