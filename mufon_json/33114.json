When I saw the 2 orbs or very large white lights when I was taking my last dogs for his walk and I was so amazed to what I saw!! They moved from the west to North east they were not together at the time and sort of came together at least closer as they were moving to the east. They did move quite fast with no noise at all. When I saw the light I had no idea what they were and I was sure that they , were not planes or medical choppers which fly over any time of the day. So walked to the top of the hill in my yard to watch them and the moved very fast and to the east. By the time I go up to see them move east they were almost out of sight and this was only in a few minutes time."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"33114","Object Shape":"Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"2 white orbs spoted Nov. 2 over Pa.","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.528955,+-79.461431(33114)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33114) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Avonmore","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"11/02/2011 08:30 UTC"}
