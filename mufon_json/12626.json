The night sky was the clearest of nights (I did not know there were that many visible stars at night in the country side at the time!) and the orange glow from the each city lights could be seen in the faint distance from either direction and we were traveling say 12:30am or later from south to north and traveling on the highway through the desert. We were clearly at a higher elevation in which we could see miles all around us, as the night moon lit the desert sand. I and 4 other people in a van (had windows all around with no blinds) was on and we were just talking about the weekend) saw an object descending as the speed of a comet, stopped in mid air (what appeared to be about half a second), then at the same speed, right angled upward (same speed) and was gone. I did not see any craft but that bluish green right angle moment is stamped in my mind and changed my opinion about life forever!"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12626.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12626.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/30/1993 12:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Distrito Federal","Latitude":"19.436098","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
