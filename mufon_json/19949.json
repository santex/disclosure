I noticed a very large patchy illuminous object 30 degrees up from the horizon due east. Looked very much like a comet tail. It would change its appearance and luminosity a bit Wasn't sure if it was a sliver of the moon behind a cloud. Also wondered if it was another atmospheric NASA Rocket. Although there were some high stratus clouds and stars were bright this object appeared to be farther away than the few alto stratus clouds. It just seemed odd and out of place. Pulled off exit 10 on rt 2 and watched it for a while maybe 4 minutes before it slowly subsided and vanished. Skys were relatively clear, could see Bernice's Hair easily in the lit parking lot."],"Object Shape":"Teardrop","Region":"Connecticut","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-72.537708","Summary":"comet like object due east then disapeared","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Glastonbury","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-10152009-0003"}
