It remained around the same altitude for over 4 mins but moved left to right fairly quickly (quicker than any airplane I've ever seen) and may have moved up and down a bit too. It was very high and very far away but it almost looked like it would get closer and further away also. I thought I was just seeing things but then I noticed a couple cars were pulled over looking at it also. As I walked by one of the cars, I asked if they were looking at it and it was two girls that saw it, pulled over, and were watching it and they were freaked out. About that time, the light just disappeared and I walked in the gas station. I came back home and looked it up and there are definitely others around me that have seen it in the past."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52493.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52493.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-112.038048","Case Number":"52493","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/29/2013 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/29/2013 03:03 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11292013-0009","Source":"MUFON","City":"Phoenix","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around November 29th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
