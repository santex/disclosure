We watched the object hoover and the lights seemed to get brighte. After about 10-12 minutes the object either flew away or gained too much ascension and distance from us to see the lights any longer. My boy freind and I have seen similiar objects in our area and in nyc earlier this year and several years before this incident took place."],"Log Number":"US-10062011-0020","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"me and 3 friends saw a triangular shaped object with 3 bright white lights in each corner hoovering over the Tappan Z bridge","Region":"New York","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in White Plains","There were no other sightings in White Plains on or around September 28th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"None","City":"White Plains"}
