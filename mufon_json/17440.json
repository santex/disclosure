{"Region":"Alberta","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs I was driving home to work on June 9, 2009 at about 7:20pm I noticed a very bright or shiny object very high and distant in the sky. There were almost no clouds in the sky at this time, and no clouds around the area where the object was spotted. I looked to me light a bright star in the night sky yet it was still very bright out as the sun was about 1 hour from setting and no stars were visible. The object traveled at a very slow rate from south to north and as I watched it for about 4 minutes it began to fade or become much dimmer before completely disappearing in the sky."],"Date of the Event":"06/09/2009 07:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17440.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17440.html"],"trends":["There have been 76 other sightings in Calgary","There were no other sightings in Calgary on or around June 9th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:30","Latitude":"51.04635","Summary":"Very bright/shiny star-like object seen travelling south to north at a slow rate before slowly shrinking in size and then vanished.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.04635,+-114.054522(17440)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17440) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Calgary","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Case Number":"17440","Country":"Canada","Date Submitted":"06/09/2009 07:20 UTC","Log Number":"CA-06122009-0014","Longitude":"-114.054522","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
