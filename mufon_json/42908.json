The lights were rather bright and would flicker on and off and it appeared to be moving through the cloud cover. Then the lights appeared in a different spot over to the left, and finally there appeared to be a smaller flickering light off to the left of the larger light. It looked like it was a plane flying towards us in the clouds, but when the position changed so abruptly and then the appearance of the second set of lights it was just very strange. I realize this is not much of sighting, but it was like nothing I've seen before. There were other planes in the area but they seemed to be flying below the clouds. The lights appeared to be very bright, compared to the other lights on the planes. The time was about 7 minutes while I pulled over into a parking lot to watch. I kept expecting to see a plane emerge from the clouds (there was a break in the cloud cover) and never did. The lights just simply faded out and stopped. I tried to record the video on my ipod, but upon watching it it's just a black screen, the lights were not bright enough to show up on the video."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/29/2012 11:00 UTC"}
