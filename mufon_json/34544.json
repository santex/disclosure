We were star gazing as there were a ;large number of shooting stars that night. I had seen a few satelites passby and was pointing them out too my friends when one looked as if it just got ten times brighter and then was no longer visiable.There were two other objects that done the same thing over a time frame of just a few mins each coming from a diffrent part of the sky. The weird thing was the objects got bright and disappeared in the same spot in the sky, right in the middle of a cluster of close star type of lights that formed a triangle.If you hold out your arm at full lenght and spread your fingers apart about an inch that was the size of the cluster in the starfield . best way I can give you a size and distance from us. I'd like to talk with someone about this to help me understand just what we saw that night."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Uwharrie","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-01032012-0001","Latitude":"35.41514","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"3 star like objects came togther into a triangle","City":"Uwharrie","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"01/03/2012 12:46 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34544.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34544.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/17/2011 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"34544","Longitude":"-80.003661","Region":"North Carolina"}
