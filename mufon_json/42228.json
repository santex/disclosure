It had two Bright white huge lights. it was flying toward a straight direction (unknown direction exactly) but then turned coming towards my direction and it looked huge. All of the sudden the object turned around smoothly and I noticed a third bright light. That is when I noticed it was a triangle shape craft. Where I live I constantly see planes, helicopters and private jets flying in my area and notice they have blinking lights on them and are very loud of course. Now this craft (ufo) I saw was huge, had no blinking lights like mentioned above and had NO SOUND. I was amazed for the size of the object how smooth it flew and the shape but the fact it had no sound amazed me. I really would like to know what I saw but of course we never get answers. I have never seen anything like this and it really will be on my mind forever. Amazing!"],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"09/02/2012 12:48 UTC","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/01/2012 09:26 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.977799,+-99.893643(42228)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42228) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42228.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42228.html"],"Case Number":"42228","Longitude":"-99.893643","Log Number":"US-09022012-0021","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile"}
