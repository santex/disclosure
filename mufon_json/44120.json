They were moving in a slow paced North-West to South-West direction circling each other in an erratic pattern. Due to the dark it made it hard to see if there was two close together or just the one. When I first spotted the orbs I thought they were Parachutes but they never dropped any lower from their height and didn't move in the way that a parachutist would. I followed the objects across the nights sky until they went behind a large tree in my neighbours back yard where I lost sight of them. I had tried to film the objects but my iPod and Phone do not have a camera that would pick up objects that far away and at night. After the sighting I was in a bit of shock, came inside and told a couple of friends about it online."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44120.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44120.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/24/2012 08:23 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Outside calling in my dog when I spotted 2-3 glowing orbs circling each other moving in a NW to SW direction","Date of the Event":"11/25/2012 11:25 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Lithgow","There were no other sightings in Lithgow on or around November 25th 2012"],"Country":"Australia","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"150.175216","Latitude":"-33.489024","City":"Lithgow","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"AU-11242012-0006","Case Number":"44120"}
