I am an engineer having worked for companies involved in the design of aircraft, missiles, outer space vehicles and the like, as well as a math professor, having taught at Long Island University, Brooklyn campus, some 25 years ago. This is my encounter; My then girl friend (wife now) lived at 414 Rosemont Ave, La Jolla, California, which is right off the beach. On Sunday night, October 17, 1965, at 7:15PM, we were walking along the edge of the beach only 1 block from our apartment. We were very startled and amazed, when suddenly there came into view 4 flying saucers, going southbound, about ��� mile inland and less than ��� mile in height. They were flying fast in a diagonal line formation, were definitely piloted, each gently and separately undulating up and down as though slightly buffeted by the wind. They emitted no lights and made not a single perceptible sound. We had been easily hearing birds chirping in the distance but no engine sound or even a sound of airflow was perceptible, and the day was bright and clear and otherwise quiet. We were just out of earshot of the sound of waves hitting the beach. These vehicles were not birds, not balloons, not airplanes, not swamp gas, not temperature inversions, not kites, not anything but saucer shaped vehicles. There could be no way we could be mistaken as everything was in day-clear close view. My eyes happened to concentrate on the under rim of the saucers. I saw a dark brown colored rim on the underside of the saucers of perhaps 2 feet in width. The vehicles otherwise were approximately the color of aluminum. I saw 3 hemispheric undercarriages spaced circularly at 120 degrees apart. I saw portholes. My girl friend���s vision happened to concentrate on the top most portion and she saw yellow light in the portholes. They flew past us at perhaps 350 miles per hour and we had them in view maybe 6 seconds in all. They were less than ��� mile from us at the closest point. Based on the angle subtended by the vehicles and my estimate of the distance to them, I would make an educated guess that their sizes were about 150 feet in diameter each and perhaps 20 feet in height not counting the height of their undercarriages. They flew in the direction of the San Diego Airport and seemed to be totally unconcerned at being seen or if it was a danger to them. They appeared to be their own masters. I phoned the San Diego Airport, the Miramar Naval Station and informed them as well as the local police. The police told me they had not received any calls thus far. Miramar Naval Station recorded my phone conversation but would not answer as to whether there were any other witnesses. After this encounter, my friend and I found a book in the library called ���Flying Saucers and Outer Space���, written maybe in 1955. On one page there was a drawing of a flying saucer. As soon as we saw it, we both said to each other ���that is just what we saw���. Mind you, prior to this, I and my friend had thought that those who said they saw flying saucers were seeing things by mass hallucinations, and gave these reports no credence at all. And neither of us had read a book on this subject. My girl friend became very frightened at this incident, and I, foolishly wished they would have just stopped and taken me aboard for a ride. But, having worked as a mechanical engineer in the Space industry for 20 years, and being well up on every flying vehicle known to man, for one thing I know of no vehicle now or even contemplated, that can fly without a very noisy engine to power it. If there was a noiseless engine it would have been put to very good use a long time ago, for example on the very expensive Concord Aircraft, which is only allowed to fly over uninhabited areas because of the incredibly loud noise it makes. From this fact and my general feelings about this I must conclude (the U.S. government and any naysayers not withstanding) that these vehicles are of a very very advanced stage of technology and that they are not of this earth.
