I was about to lay back down in bed but saw this light in the sky outside of my bedroom window. At first I thought it was a plane but it remained stationary and I watched the brightness of the object changed from an intense white to a kind of bluish white then red and just slowly dim out. I awakened my wife who also saw the object before it dimmed out."],"Summary":"Starlike object in the sky","Date of the Event":"07/14/2012 04:30 UTC","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40789.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40789.html"],"Latitude":"41.341412","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.341412,+-89.009716(40789)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40789) map </A>","Longitude":"-89.009716","Log Number":"US-07142012-0014","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"40789","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","trends":["There has been one other sighting in North Utica","There were no other sightings in North Utica on or around July 14th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"07/14/2012 06:00 UTC"}
