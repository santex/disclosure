Right as I was opening my car door I had the urge to look up. I think the Suns reflection off of the plane or the orb itself may have flashed and caught my peripheral. Anyway I looked up and noticed a SW Airline plane at 30��� NE heading West (roughly over Lake Travis). I noticed a bright white orb on its trail. The sky was completely clear and sunny out. I had to take my sunglasses off to make sure what I was seeing was not a reflection. Not less than 30 seconds later, the orb slowed to almost a complete stop and veered 5��� NE as the plane continued its heading. As the orb came out of its turn, another orb came out of nowhere (possibly from the right of just appeared). The 2 orbs then proceeded to converge toward each other stopping at what appeared to be a side by side flight formation. They continued on heading north while climbing altitude until they slowly vanished. (The attached photo is a sketch of the incident I drew right after it happened. It has 2 time points (a & b) for reference) Side note: I am college educated and have been an avid sky watcher for many years, frequently viewing and photographing planes and helicopters. I have never seen anything like this and definitely had chills running up my spine after the incident had passed. Also - I am not sure if this is related but later that evening there were helicopters circling the area. There was nothing crime or medically related that I could find on the news the next day and have never seen that many helicopter circling and patrolling the area."],"Case Number":"22298","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Longitude":"-97.991679","Date Submitted":"03/15/2010 12:02 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.367979,+-97.991679(22298)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22298) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lakeway","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Saw an orb following a SW Airliner.
