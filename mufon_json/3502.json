It was around 11PM June 24th, 2005. We were approximately 20 miles past Barstow, 40 miles away from Baker when we spotted a solitare white light off to the northwest side of the highway. As we continued northbound, two additional lights came into view, equal distance and angle from the center light. It was not moving as far as we could tell and seemed to be a star system more or less. But it seemed to be getting closer as we drove closer. It was. As we drove closer towards the lights, we noticed we could not see the stars within the triangle shape of the lights. Then we passed it. We were northeast of it as we continued North on the hwy. This, in my mind, proved to me that it was not a star configuration or a star at all. We lost sight of it becuase we never stopped."],"Date of the Event":"06/24/2005 11:00 UTC","Region":"California"}
