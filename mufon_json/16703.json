The blinds ������in the bathroom are almost always up since we live in the country and the bathroom faces the woods in the back. I caught a glance out the bathroom window and noticed a blinking bright light that kept moving around really fast. I saw this same object about two weeks ago and told my parents about it. By the time I made it to their bedroom to wake them so they could see it, it was gone. This time I happened to have my cell phone in hand because my alarm was not yet completely disarmed. I turned on my cell and video recorded the UFO in the sky. I didn���������t think that it was going ������to show up since my cell doesn���������t record well in the dark. I tried it anyway. I opened the window to the bathroom so that I wouldn���������t get a glare. Once the window was opened I could hear noises that seemed as though they were coming from the UFO. It was like a humming swirling buzz sound that would get louder then quiet like it was going fast & slowing down. The neighbors dogs were also barking and an airplane was flying right over the UFO. I couldn���������t guess how far away ������it was because it was too dark outside for me to tell. The moon was to the right of the UFO and was easily triple the size of the UFO. I caught several 30 second videos with my phone until the object got too far away to video with my cell phone. The UFO did show in the videos as a small white light and does show the movement I saw. I couldn���������t tell if the object had color to it or not. I thought I saw some rainbow coloring but not for sure because it didn���������t stay in one place long enough to really focus in on it. Once my dad woke up I showed him the video. He went outside to check things out & didn���������t see anything. He told me to show the videos to my step-mom so that she could analyze them. I was asked to write this report to explain what I saw. I have always been a skeptic until this incident.\""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"16703","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/17/2009 05:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-04272009-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16703.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16703_submitter_file3__strange-light1blownup.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16703.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.489047,+-86.124053(16703)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16703) map </A>"}
