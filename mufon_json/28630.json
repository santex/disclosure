{"Summary":"I saw a transparent boomerang in the sky over marshall.","Region":"Minnesota","divs":["Sighting DetailsI walked to the store tonight as usual. However, on the way home when I looked up as I always do it was as if something yanked my head to the side to turn me backwards. It was then I saw the object. I followed its path for about 15-20 Sec. completely mesmerized by what i saw. My entire body tingled. It is colored gray because it was almost transparent. The lights were also dim, as if to add to the transparency, I couldn't believe my eyes."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Marshall","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"28630","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28630.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28630.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.398129,+-95.898714(28630)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28630) map </A>","Latitude":"44.398129","Longitude":"-95.898714","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/12/2011 12:17 UTC","Log Number":"US-04122011-0001","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/12/2011 10:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Marshall","There were no other sightings in Marshall on or around April 12th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
