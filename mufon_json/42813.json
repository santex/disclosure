{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were out having cigarettes, looking at the little sprinkling that the weather people were calling rain and I noticed my step-son looking up with a weird look on his face. I looked in the direction in which he was fixed and saw what appeared to be the moon, but as we looked at it, it started to glow brighter. Then it faded away slowly (30 seconds maybe)into what appeared to be a equilateral triangle cloud. The cloud moved toward the south a little bit and changed shape into a three point star and vaporized. It seemed to have some sort of cloaking mechanism. Though there were clouds in the sky, this was not your normal cloud. I said \"did you see that?\" he goes \"yeah\" all weird sounding and i say \"that was a ufo or something; that wasn't the moon\" he concurred."],"Longitude":"-96.675359","Latitude":"40.816592","City":"Lincoln","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Lincoln","There was one other sighting in Lincoln on or around September 24th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"09/25/2012 10:19 UTC","Region":"Nebraska","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.816592,+-96.675359(42813)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42813) map </A>","Summary":"at first we thought it was the moon, but then it disappeared into a triangular cloud","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42813.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"42813","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Egg, Oval","Date of the Event":"09/24/2012 09:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-09252012-0007"}
