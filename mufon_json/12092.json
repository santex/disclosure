As the craft passed quietly overhead, the white alternating blinking lights emitted a red blinking light from left to right and then back to white, repeating the sequence. The shape of the aircraft looked to be triangular, with an additional steady but dimmer white light under the body. Approximate total time aircraft was in sight was 7 minutes."],"Case Number":"12092","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"triangle shaped with two lights towards the front and one on the end. all on the underbody","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12092.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12092.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Longitude":"-87.623208","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City"}
