He is an ameteur astronomer and knows the sky, and he said that this object should not be there. Besides, it was larger than a planet, about the size of a penny held at arm's length or larger. We watched it for about 15 minutes as it just blnked off then several seconds later came back on again. It repeated this in a random fashion, there was no order to it. we tried timing the seconds between when it went off and on but it was always different every time - 20 seconds, then 5, then 8, etc. Then it went out for one last time and did not come back on again. There was no sound. It appeared to be fairly close to us but it was hard to tell. There was a weird red glow around the outside of the white center light."],"Object Features":"Dome","Summary":"Strange large bright light dissappeared and reappeared several times","City":"Independence","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.080084,+-94.446148(39937)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39937) map </A>"}
