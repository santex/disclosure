As the plane flew under the craft my perception was thatthe craft was nowhere near the airplane. The craft seemed to tip sideways andonce forward to reveal a saucer shape. We all questioned what we were seeing andagreed that the craft was very far away and must have been very large. It justdid not belong there. It was not a ballon or aircraft or planet. There wasnothing in the sky other than the quick passing of the plane to compare it tobut we had plenty of time to study it and found it very puzzleing. We all havemuch better things to do with our time than look for objects in the sky but thisjust dint fit. Maybe someone else saw it or maybe the pilot or passangers sawsomething but there it was, whatever plane as day."],"Date of the Event":"05/18/2001 10:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1173.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1173.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1173.html"],"Longitude":"-72.512586","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.06454","Summary":"craft over golf coarse","Date Submitted":"05/18/2001 10:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy","trends":["There have been no other sightings in East Longmeadow","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"1173","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.06454,+-72.512586(1173)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1173) map </A>","Region":"Massachusetts","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
