We were all in the driveway of our home supervising our kids as they were shooting fireworks. We live in a subdivision of lots of houses and our house is very close to a very busy highway. There were 8 of us that witnessed this object and I do have video of it. The witnesses were myself (37), my wife (34), my mother in law, my daughter (15) and her friend, and my son (8) and his friend. All of us witnessed the object. We saw it 3 different times in about a 20 minute period, witnessing it for about 2 minutes at a time. It made no sound and was definitely NOT an airplane, helicopter or hot air balloon. I did not know what the object was but I was glad I was witnessing it and am very curious to know what it was. The first time we saw it, it was flying from the north northeast to the south then turning and flying northeast at a fairly low speed. I was standing in my driveway watching the object and also recording it with my camcorder. The second time we saw it coming from the south flying east to northeast. The third time we saw it flying again from the north to south then turning and flying northeast. It was a very beautiful orange color that seemed to glow. The farther away from us the object flew its orange light got dimmer and dimmer until we couldn't see it anymore. This is how we knew it was flying away from us. We did not see the object again and finished up our fireworks a few minutes later around midnight. After uploading the video from my mini-dvd camcorder to my computer and zooming in on the object you can clearly see the object was changing colors, blue, red, green, white, and some purple."],"City":"Baton Rouge","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.464763,+-91.13081(11514)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11514) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/04/2008 11:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Baton Rouge","There were no other sightings in Baton Rouge on or around July 4th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-91.13081","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Louisiana","Tags":"City"}
