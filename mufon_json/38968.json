The object began to slow down, then hovered for about three to five seconds. Then the object quickly ascended approximately 20-30 feet then quickly descended to the original position. The object again hovered for a few more seconds then quickly moved to the right; faster than any plane I have ever seen. It made another quick right, stopped, hovered, then made a quick descend out of our sight. The lights were a yellowish-orange color that pulsated and changed to red. This has to be the craziest thing I have ever seen and I hope it was a UFO because I have never seen one before! I really wish we could have gotten footage of this object but I didn't have the phone on me and it only lasted one to two minutes total!"],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:30"}
