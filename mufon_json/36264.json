I saw what appeared at first as an aerial comet coming out of the southwest sky. We waited for it to explode but it didn't. It proceeded on a southwest to northeast at a significant rate of speed, following this course until it disappeared over the horizon. No sound was heard. It was a clear sky and there was no contrail or silouette of an aircraft or aircraft ID lights. I was curious to know if anyone else had seen this."],"Date of the Event":"01/01/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.521709","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
