On December 26th about 11 pm I was out walking my dogs. ( Sorry, I live in Palm Bay Fl.) I looked up towards the east north east and saw a couple meteorites burning in our atmosphere. Then there were these two stars just north of Orion. I saw an object flash from one to the other. I thought maybe it was a \"shooting star\" but a few minutes later it went back the other way. I can't even begin to say how fast it was moving or the distance. It happened again last night. Has any other reports been called or e-mailed in? Joe Vanchieri Jr. i have never seen anything like this. Spent four year in USAF where SR-71s flew out of. It covered what looked like thousands of miles in very little time. It happened again the same time on the 27th. In the exact same place. I am well grounded but it was as if they were trying to blend into the meteorite falling that night."],"Date of the Event":"12/26/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
