The sound resembled a crhoss between a heavenly choir and wind in the wires of many sailboats. It was not a hum, but more of what one would hear from a mixed choir. It seemed to come from directly over our house, perhaps coming from the east and heading west towards South Puget Sound. I went outside to determine the source, but could see nothing. The sound continued to move and was difficult to pinpoint, but it was overhead. It blocked out other sounds, I heard no jet aircraft from the local airport, and birds were seen on wires but were silent. The sound did not seem to bother our dogs. The sound moved to the sound and was lost in the distance, heading towards Gig Harbor. The sky had low cloud cover. This was not the first time we've heard this same mysterious sound."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/04/2008 05:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.902802","Log Number":"US-07042008-0005","Date Submitted":"07/04/2008 05:40 UTC","Region":"Washington","Tags":"City","City":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Loud overhead sound overhead like choir or wind in wires"}
