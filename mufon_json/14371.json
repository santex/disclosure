{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-114.045936","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my wife were coming home from the store when my wife asked me to stop and check the mail box. As I did I noticed two amber colored lights southeast of us above the mountain ridge, I called my wife`s attention to it and we both observed it shifting color, amber illumination with some red, shimmering as a Christmas light would do with a fading trickling type of pulse, I would estimate these mountains are about 15-20 miles away, beyond these mountains are the Hualapai mountain range a good distance away from Kingman Arizona so I know that they were in our area of the neighborhood. a few moments later we started scrabbling for a monocularI had in the car but by then their lights had dissipated. This not the first sighting in this area we have witnessed but it is the first MUFON report we have written, perhaps someone can take some interest in our area, We have quite a few sightings out this way and deserves more attention! thank you for your time."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:02:30","Log Number":"US-12112008-0014","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.196343,+-114.045936(14371)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14371) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Kingman","Case Number":"14371","Date Submitted":"12/11/2008 06:43 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Summary":"Two Amber colored lights above the mountains.","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14371.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14371.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.196343","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/11/2008 06:43 UTC","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Kingman","There were no other sightings in Kingman on or around December 11th 2008"]}
