(as if it were a old fashioned photo flash bulb.) only very bright and much larger. we both looked at each other. i slowed the car. i said did you see that ?she said, i saw the bright light flash 3 times but not at the same time as if it was in a delayed pattern. i agreed. we decided to pull over on the side of the shoulder to see if we could see anything more. i looked behind us and there was not a car in sight for miles but could see an overpass ahead. we pulled over to the shoulder on the right side of the road just past the overpass. we stopped the car and pulled to the side of the road but there was nothing. we took off back onto the interstate. we were going about 50 miles hour increasing our speed when another bright flash occurred. closer this time almost touching the car hood, in front middle. the light floated to the passenger side of the vehicle almost as if it was hugging or surrounding the car. again it was off the ground above the car approximately at the height of the rear view mirror. the second blink 1 second later a short surge of light was directly even with the car at the passenger window. the third flash again in a later 2 second delay pattern from the first. it was if something was flying like a very large lightening bug only with a very bright led light flash about the size of a volleyball. after each flash it appeared to have a diamond shaped light or a cross formation as it dimmed out. we kept driving in disbelief as to what we just saw. we never did see an object. just very bright orb like led lights in 3 sequencial flashes but with a shorter delay between the 2nd 3rd flash. 2 separate times. driving at that speed we were just dumb founded as to what it could be. especially after the second incident as it was in front of the car and we were traveling over 50 miles an hour but it seemed to mock our speed and hang in the air right with us. we never heard any odd sounds.the witness was in the passenger front side of the car."],"Log Number":"US-07052009-0036","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17832.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17832.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/25/2009 11:25 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Date Submitted":"06/25/2009 11:25 UTC"}
