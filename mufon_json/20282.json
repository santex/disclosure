I made a pot of coffee and as soon as it was finished, I got a cup and walked outside in the back yard. It was a crystal Clear night and I saw a falling star. It was a pretty one as it split into about 4 sections as it burned out.I decided to keep looking up to see if I might catch another one. A minute or two passed and I saw something moving out of the north sky. It was a bright star like object but it looked much larger than the surrounding stars. It was traveling southward at a speed slower than a falling star but much faster than any aircraft I've ever witnessed. It was moving in a southeast direction and I was out of sight within ten seconds. About a minute or so later another one came by just like the first and it flew in the same direction at what seemed to be the same speed, I've never seen anything like this,"],"Summary":"2 brilliant white lights, about 4 times the size as the largest star in the night sky","Sighting Duration":"00:01:12","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-11032009-0002","Region":"Georgia","Date Submitted":"11/03/2009 12:13 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Cairo","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.877413","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Case Number":"20282","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cairo","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
