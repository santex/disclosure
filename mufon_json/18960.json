This \"star\" stayed in the sky approx. 4 -5 hours in the same general area. It could have been longer but I only noticed it around 11:30pm. I took 178 pics and these two stood out the most. It was definitley one \"star\" changing shapes several times and changing colors. It would fade in and out and then brighten and dim and hover. I got tired of watching it and finally went to bed. Pics were not altered except to crop them and zoom in."],"Longitude":"-120.503939","Summary":"Took pics of shape changing \"star\" that changed colors from Yakima, WA","Sighting Duration":"04:01:01","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.603451,+-120.503939(18960)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18960) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/18/2009 11:01 UTC","Log Number":"US-08302009-0002"}
