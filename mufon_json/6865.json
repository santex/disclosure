{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting Detailsi was at my friend paul longstaffs house and went outside to have a cigarette as he has young children and a no smoking policy when the kids are in.I noticed this object as soon as i stepped out of his front door as it was so bright and asked him to have a look,this object was the most unusual colour orange and it was pulsing as it moved across the sky slow then quickly,at this point we were joined by pauls daughter chloe who is 9 years old,she also witnessed this event which scared her.i am an amateur astronomer and i know what meteorites satellites and planets look like,, it was about the same size as a jumbo jet but round and the nearest thing i can liken it to is a firework rocket just as it explodes but caught in freeze frame and pulsating without exploding,, i must stress that this was no firework at all.it went from south to north and across newcastle airports flight path then instantly vanished.i have been in touch with the british astronomical society and am waiting for a reply back,i nor my friend have ever seen anything like this it was weird,really weird.an orange transluscent pulsing object is what the three of us seen,it was no aircraft and whatever it was there was no noise,totally silent.i would estimate it flew at between 3000 to 5000 feet.if it was higher then this object must have been huge.i am in utter shock at seeing this as is paul because we just cannot think of what this is or could possibly have been. yours Graham Little."],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-1.382521","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Sunderland","There were no other sightings in Sunderland on or around April 20th 2007"],"Region":"England","Country":"United Kingdom","Latitude":"54.916569","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6865.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6865.html"],"Case Number":"6865","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"very unusual ufo","Log Number":"GB-04212007-0006","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date of the Event":"04/20/2007 10:22 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Sunderland","Date Submitted":"04/20/2007 10:22 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=54.916569,+-1.382521(6865)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6865) map </A>"}
