As I was looking at one of the small blue breaks in the clouds above me and slightly to the west, when suddenly I noticed a saucer craft going through the break in the clouds heading from the northeast heading southwest. The craft was cloud-white colored on the bottom with the top part that I could see silver with a purple-blue dome on top with streaks of gold on the back part of the dome. I saw the craft for about three seconds (or less). Since I have realized that what I saw was a lot bigger than I thought at the time. The craft was thicker through the middle than the sides."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15316.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15316.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","Longitude":"-116.946216","Summary":"Saucer vehicle went through a break in the clouds I was looking up at.","Region":"Idaho","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15316","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date Submitted":"07/30/2007 02:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
