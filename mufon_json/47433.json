Saw a large round object hovering over the interstate. It was big!!! Other people saw it because I pulled over to the side of the highway and so did other people from both directions it was very large, over both sides of 4 lane highway. Round metal. Had three rows of lights outside row white second row red inside row white. It was magnificent. Felt like a once in a lifetime sight. Not something I'll ever forget. Just would like to know if anyone else reported it all those years ago. I didn't know how to then. I can draw it for you but I don't know how to do it on the computer."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"47433"}
