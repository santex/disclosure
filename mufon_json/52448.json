It first appeared as though it were lights on top of a tall tower, but we soon realized that they were too bright and too high to be any tower that we were aware of in the area. It also did not appear to be moving fast enough to be an air craft. As we approached it, the high way veered to the east and I was able to view the object out of the drivers' window of my car. My wife was unable to see it at that point, but I could see that it was surrounded by white lights, and triangle-shaped with a red light in the middle... a \"classic\" triangle-shaped craft. No lights were blinking, and it moved so slow that I could not tell if it were moving south or hovering. I eventually lost sight of of it as we continued north on I-91."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Longitude":"-72.582864","Date Submitted":"11/26/2013 09:41 UTC","Region":"Massachusetts","Log Number":"US-11262013-0019","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.050102,+-72.582864(52448)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52448) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/25/2013 07:10 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Longmeadow","There were no other sightings in Longmeadow on or around November 25th 2013"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Longmeadow","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City"}
