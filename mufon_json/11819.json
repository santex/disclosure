The tail that it had faded out. It then slowed until the object seemed to be going at a steady high speed directly north. I called my friends from inside the house after the object changed direction suddenly and started heading due east. Three other people also saw the object while it was heading to the east and seemed to fade away until it was no longer visible almost like the light was going out slowly. The object was very much star like in appearance besides the fact that it was a solid blue glow and had no twinkle like a normal star. Needless to say we were all a little weirded out by it. In total from the time I first spotted it to the moment it faded away was a span of about two minutes."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07302008-0006","Summary":"Star like object with solid glow flew over head from the south with a tail wich later disapeared..
