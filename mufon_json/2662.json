{"Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was going to Whataburger that night for a burger of course and I saw somethingup in the sky. Like...something on fire but it was pretty high up and it wasobviously moving. I passed one treeline and made sure that it wasn92t just a flag or a radio antenna or even a sign on a building...it was toohigh for that. So I passed a second treeline and it was more faint. Then Ipassed a building and when I could see that part of the sky again, it was gone.At first I was thinking it was a plane on fire or something along that nature,but it just disappeared. Very odd.It seemed to me that what I was seeing was the exhaust from a jet-engine.Instead of there being a shape of the actual object, I saw the shape of the fireor jet propulsion. It was red-orange and it was flickering, but the object wasdefinitely moving. The shape of the emmission, I suppose, was blimp-like."],"Object Shape":"Blimp","Date Submitted":"11/02/2003 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There was one other sighting in Fort Worth on or around November 2nd 2003"],"City":"Fort Worth","Date of the Event":"11/02/2003 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"2662","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.732039","Summary":"Saw red-orange blimplike object","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2662.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2662.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-97.31257","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.732039,+-97.31257(2662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2662) map </A>"}
