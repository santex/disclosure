I've noticed this light 5 times in the past 3 weeks. Definitely wasn't an airplane or a helicopter. I live not to far from the Willow Grove Air Base so I definitely know what a airplane & helicopter look like at night. It's was not a star, planet or satellite. Was able to watch this object for about 30 mins. Went back in the house & came out to check on it about an hr later it was gone. It was a clear night out. This object seemed to at times grow extremely bright & then dim. Looked like it was rotating. Hovered for 15 minutes & then very slowly started to move to the east. Several airplanes and a helicopter in the area. Way more then I normally see on a given night. And they were all in the area of this object. My husband was also puzzled by this object. Attaching a picture which does not do it justice it was several times brighter than the picture."],"Longitude":"-75.169823","Latitude":"40.276693","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.276693,+-75.169823(51842)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51842) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51842.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51842.html"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
