The thing that made me notice it was it moved from right to left and then disapeered behind the tree. then it came out again, the same way and it happen about 3 times, then i went inside and got my camcorder and recorded it, then it happen a couple more times but my batteries were dead so i couldn't get any more video. when seing this i thought it was a light from either a plane or helicopter but there was no noise of any kind from the light. The next day i was going to upload the video on youtube but when i uploaded it on the computer, i couldn't see nothing since the video was so blurry. The video im uploading is a 19 sec video and the orb of light is going in the middle of the screen at the 17 and 18 sec. mark."],"City":"Pittsburgh","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-11242008-0049"}
