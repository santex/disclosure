I looked up and saw a bright light heading in a SE direction. I pointed it out to my Uncle, and we noticed a second smaller one to the left and trailing the brighter one. Shotly after noticing the second one, we realized a third. It too, was to the left, but further. Position was in front of the second one. They all seem to be moving at a fast and constant speed. There were no red and green flashing light associated with them. Altituted, I'm not sure. The bright one was pretty bright. Brighter than any airplane I've seen around here. The other ones were dim. I went inside aftter they left our sight, to track were the space shuttle was, because I new it was landing soon. It was nowhere near Iowa at the time in question. I'm not one to report things like this, but this was a real head scratcher!!!!!!!!!!!!"],"Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.422766,+-95.111409(20759)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20759) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/27/2009 12:09 UTC","Summary":"One bright and two other lights heading SE direction","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"11/26/2009 06:15 UTC","Region":"Iowa","Log Number":"US-11272009-0009","Tags":"City","Latitude":"43.422766","City":"Spirit Lake","Country":"United States","Case Number":"20759"}
