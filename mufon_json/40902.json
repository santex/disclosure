I immediately ran outside to my backyard and watched it as it hovered about a mile away. I was maybe thinking that it was a plane, but then I remembered that never in my life have I ever seen anything like this before and I didn't here anything, no sound whatsoever. From the time I seen the lights, they appeared clustered together, and slowly started to triangulate, after about five minutes it slowy started to move towards me. As it went over I only seen two lights, one was leading and the other was following, the third light just disappeared mysteriously. Lately I've been reading in my local newspaper about recent UFO sightings in my area but I didn't believe it, after what I saw I have to say that I now believe. Witnessing this made me feel somewhat nervous, extremely startled and after I went inside, I began to feel a weird energy inside my body that I couldn't explain."],"Date Submitted":"07/18/2012 01:44 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40902.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40902.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Apple Valley","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.521469","Date of the Event":"07/17/2012 10:25 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.521469,+-117.188564(40902)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40902) map </A>","Longitude":"-117.188564","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Apple Valley","There were no other sightings in Apple Valley on or around July 17th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"It was a triangular light formation in the sky.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07182012-0010"}
