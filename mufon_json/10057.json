{"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"One big star in the center with five circling it.","Case Number":"10057","divs":["Sighting Details One night on July 3rd it was about 9:00pm when me and my family went to sleep but I just stood awake and stared outside of my window into the sky. About 2 hours later I realized a bright star and it caught my attention so I stared at it for a while and slowly five smaller stars came out from the brighter star and the smaller stars started circling the big star and it was moving around. I was really amazed at what i was seeing. Then i saw it fly away really fast. I tried waking up my brother to tell him but he was fast asleep. I wasn't too sure it was a UFO that i saw until i watched the History channel about 2 months ago and they showed the same UFO I saw and so i was sure i saw a UFO. I couldnt sleep that night because i couldnt belive what i just saw.so then i came to this website to report me UFO sighting."],"Date Submitted":"07/03/2007 11:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.786851,+-119.413192(10057)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10057) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Longitude":"-119.413192","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/03/2007 11:30 UTC","Latitude":"36.786851","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10057.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10057.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10057.html"],"trends":[],"Log Number":"US-03262008-0013","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
