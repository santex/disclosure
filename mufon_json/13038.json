{"Country":"United States","divs":["sighting detailsthis was the fifth consecutive night of sightings. the other four might be explainable, different objects, but not this one. needless to say i was looking. i walked outside to smoke a cigarette, as soon as i looked up in a west direction, i looked right to the object. it was a white orb of light with a dim circle in the middle. it was just above a cloud, maybe 20 ft. it seemed to be following above and at the same speed as the cloud. i watched it for about fifteen seconds. it was less than 1\\8 of a mile away. i got a feeling to wave hello, when i did the object faded almost immediately. less than a second later a shadow went over me, and with lack of a better way to describe, went through me. i felt it. my vision went dark for about five seconds from within. blindness."],"Log Number":"US-10142008-0004","Case Number":"13038","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13038.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13038.html"],"Longitude":"-95.36666","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.763053,+-95.36666(13038)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13038) map </A>","Summary":"Dimly lit white orb","Latitude":"29.763053","Date of the Event":"09/07/2008 11:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/07/2008 11:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Other","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around September 7th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Houston"}
