It was 11:00PM and I was on Oakland Blvd entering I-95 heading southbound towards Miami. After a minute of driving on I-95 I noticed a blue orb fly across the sky heading south west. The blue orb was only visible for about 3 seconds when I noticed it as it came into my field of vision and then dissapeared instantly without an afterglow or anything like that. It was almost like a shooting star but it wasn't. The orb maintained a consistent sphere shaped while flying. It never blinked or flashed like the lights from airplanes or helicopters. It didn't have a tail or streak like a shooting star would have. My girlfriend also noticed it. She was sitting next to me. Out of 5 people in the car only both of us saw it because it was only visible throught the windsheild. We both looked at each other said \"what the hell was that?\" I thought it was weird. I am pretty sure others that were driving next to me saw it as well because the blue orb was flying pretty low."],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"27.666497","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23705.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23705.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-81.512094","Region":"Florida","trends":[],"Summary":"blue orb","Date of the Event":"06/11/2010 11:00 UTC"}
