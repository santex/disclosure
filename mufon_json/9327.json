I know nothing flies south to north in the northern skies, out in the middle of nowhere.It made no sound and made no chemtrail either. this is in southcentral alaska 50 miles west of Glennallen. This event happened in late july or early august. I noticed also at least 10 meteors over six to eight hours late in the evening and morning, it was a slow meteor sighting night. I noticed most is that it was dark out but clear and it was moving , direcltly overhead perfect triangle with light on each corner.watched it till I could not see it any more to the north. the next couple weeks after things seemed kind of strange, cant explain though in words."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/31/2007 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"watching the meteor shower, I saw large silent triangle move south to north, with lights on each corner","Longitude":"-154.491772","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9327.html"]}
