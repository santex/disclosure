My son first spotted a bright orange light hovering over Lake Huron 3x the size of a star from a distance. It appeared to be at a stand still at that moment. When i saw it, i knew it was nothing i have ever seen before. We quick, drove down a side street to the beach to get a closer look. I drove to a road next to the beach and hopped out of the van to find it. I spotted it now just past the lake,hovering over land now,just above us. It was at a stand still for a moment then started to move strangly in slanting way in the sky upward at at a steady speed and it disappeared into the clouds going south west. It happend at about 10:00 pm near Lexington Heights Michigan on June 25th 2011. We were very excited and scared at the same time. I knew this could be a once in a life time experience. We felt lucky cause, we knew what we just saw. Something that sure is not from here. The picture i took did not show up or i would have proof."]}
