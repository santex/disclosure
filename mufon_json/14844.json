This object I have seen several times stationary in the sky. I have not seen it move in any odd way and it never disapeared while I was looking at it. Tonight it looked even bigger in the sky. Almost like it is in our orbit. This bright star turns yellow and sometimes blue as it blinks at times. I have dismissed it as maybe the International Space Station or possibly a satelite. If anyone else is in the area, you can try looking at the west sky around 7pm and see for yourself. I am sure it will be there again. If you have a telescope, maybe you can tell us what it is. Went back outside to observe it again at 9:30 pm but it had already set behind the Sierra Nevada mountains."],"Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"14844","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14844.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14844.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
