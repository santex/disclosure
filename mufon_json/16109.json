In the second pic you can see the main light on the left, but if you look closely, there is a second pattern to it���s right, and a very light third pattern at the bottom of 1 and 2. And the third pic is simply awsome, howcome I couldn���t detect that with the simple eye?, no doubdt I wasn���t looking for wierd stuff. The bright spot on the third image is sirius, in the first image you can see Orion, and checking the 3 pics, you can see some \"Stars\" in one pic, and they are absent in others, ??? The pics ware taken with the camera lying on the roof of the car, with timer sutter on, the car turned off, and nobody on board or touching it, in order not to cause any movement, and there was no wind, it was one of those beautiful nights."],"Latitude":"17.804722","City":"BalancÃÂ¡n Municipality","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-91.535833","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Movement not detected with eye, detected by 30 sec exposure.","Date of the Event":"02/16/2006 08:30 UTC","Country":"Mexico","Date Submitted":"02/16/2006 08:30 UTC"}
