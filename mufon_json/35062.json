Earlier this evening I observed the same type of light, only one due east of our house but never really stopped to take a good look at that time which was around 6:35pm but did see a fixed wing aircraft moving at a fast speed towards the light which was followed by a military looking helicopter moving and turning towards the same single light which took off up thru the cloud cover over the mountains due NE of my house. The lights at 8pm which my Wife and my Son who was driving saw had orange and yellow color in formation and turned from going West to South and kept going."],"Summary":"Observation of individual lights in formation","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=61.197507,+-149.845595(35062)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35062) map </A>","Longitude":"-149.845595"}
