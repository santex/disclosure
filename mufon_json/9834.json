Remained stationary for about 6 hours. Eventually the object dissappeared but I did not witness its departure. It may have been some sort of balloon but the fact that it remained in one position has me wondering. Attached is a photograph. Three other people with me saw this object."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.520341,+-106.241127(9834)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9834) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Translucent sphere in sky stationary for 6 hours","Case Number":"9834","City":"Mountainair","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03052008-0003","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-106.241127","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9834.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9834_submitter_file1__mountainair_002.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9834.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/28/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.520341","Region":"New Mexico","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Mountainair","There were no other sightings in Mountainair on or around February 28th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
