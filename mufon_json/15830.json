I was looking up at the sky, it was a very clear night and the stars were beautiful. As I was looking off into the distance I noticed a flashing light. At first glance it kind of looked like a plane so I was too bothered about it��� but when it started to get closer I couldn���t hear it. Now I���m confused. Here is this MASSIVE airplane flying over my apartment complex and it���s completely quiet. At that point I had called for my fianc��� to come take a look at this. As it got closer you could CLEARLY see 5 white lights and one lonesome red one. It was eerie��� this object with five lights just slowly moved across the sky until it eventually faded out completely. My camera didn���t catch all of the detail I was hoping it might; my camera isn���t the best camera. This object was huge; it was the size of the apartment building I live in (if not bigger). I am thankful that I had enough sense to grab my video camera before the craft disappeared. The duration of this event only lasted about a couple minutes; I caught the first 48 second on film."],"Date of the Event":"03/03/2009 08:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-03042009-0005","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Date Submitted":"03/03/2009 08:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.183487","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"It was huge, it flew right over my apartment complex.
