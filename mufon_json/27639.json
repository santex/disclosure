I was looking up and noticed two points of light that were brighter than any planet or star in the sky and were static. Each point was about 1.5-2 degrees left of Orion, and offset from each other by about 2 degrees. My dad and I both looked at the points of light for about 10 minutes wondering they were. We walked back into the house, and when we came out about 5 minutes later, they were gone. Our only hunch was that it was two geosynchronous satellites reflecting the sun's light back at us, but we can't confirm this."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27639.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27639.html"],"Log Number":"US-02042011-0001","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-105.077423","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Fort Collins","There were no other sightings in Fort Collins on or around January 28th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"02/04/2011 12:48 UTC","Case Number":"27639","Region":"Colorado","City":"Fort Collins","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.5864,+-105.077423(27639)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27639) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
