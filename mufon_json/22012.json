Last night it was cloudy but there were open spaces between the cloud formations. I observed over two dozen lights that were spaced out in a line with more lights slowly moving behind them. They were travelling from the southeast to west and some were slowly zigzagging along. I was amazed at the number of them so I raced back up the street to my house, put the dog inside and called my wife to come outside to observe them. She came out and saw the last few move over our heads and they proceeded to go in a westerly direction. As they were quite high in the sky we could not make out any definitive shape or sizes but they were definitely some type of craft that was being intelligently controlled. My feelings as I watched them was of some excitement and wonder as I have never observed this type of activity before."],"Date of the Event":"02/24/2010 08:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/25/2010 06:36 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Witnessed over two dozen lights in the sky moving in a slow deliberate fashion from southeast to west.","Disposition":"Unknown"}
