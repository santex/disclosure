When i noticed the object it was pulsating the colors pink,blue and in the center white. when i noticed it i thought it was a helicopter but then i realized that it had pink and blue lights which helicopters dont have. the object was stationary when i first saw it then it slowly moved up and down and stopped and did it again. i was completely blown away with what it was. i lost sight of it when it just very slowly disappered in about 10 minutes after i stopped recording and i started recording about 12-15 minutes after it appered."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.588742,+-121.401494(36889)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36889) map </A>","Case Number":"36889"}
