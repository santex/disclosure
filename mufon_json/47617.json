At first we thought it was a plane but it stopped moving then it got brighter turning into a bright bright white orb still not moving. We pulled over to record and then it seem to spray a light and a tiny cloud appeared in its place. The red orb reappeared in another spot and it happend again. We watched for another 10 mins it did not move just glowed behind te little cloud.
