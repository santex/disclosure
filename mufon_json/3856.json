Ther were a few commercial aircraft in the area, but they were noticed only because the ufo moved so much more quick and agile, which is what finally convinced my dad. would've had much time for photos, but no camera on hand. We lost immediate sight of it as it passed over and behind our view from the car, but then reappeared as a collection of all red lights in a triangular pattern moving to match car speed, then much faster into distance, took a hard left (south) and left from view."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/16/2005 08:08 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Columbia Heights","There were no other sightings in Columbia Heights on or around September 16th 2005"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3856.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3856.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/16/2005 08:08 UTC","City":"Columbia Heights","Case Number":"3856"}
