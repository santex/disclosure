Around 9:40pm we noticed two bright red lights off in the distance. They were very bright, and for a second we thought they were some sort of firework. But, we had never seen any firework like that before. This was different, the lights hovered for a few seconds and in slow motion started to desend vertically. The light was so bright that it caused the light to stretch out and cause a cross in each light. When it began to desend it appeared that there was some smoke rising above the object as an exhaust of some sort. I was confused, shocked, and scared at what I was seeing. My boyfriend was confused as to what it was also, but chalked it up to being fireworks. We did get a picture of one of the lights before it was out of sight, but we lost sight of both the objects when it went below the tree line."],"Latitude":"40.524265","Longitude":"-74.406565","Region":"New Jersey","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/04/2011 10:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08042011-0064","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Edison","There was one other sighting in Edison on or around July 4th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Edison","Case Number":"29974","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
