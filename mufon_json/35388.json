Heard a loud roar or rumble and felt house shake we both looked out window. I assumed it was a jet. When I looked out I saw a large black or grey triangle like shaped object hovering near small tree in front yard. It stayed what seemed like 15-30 seconds and was gone very quickly in sideways or horizontal direction. I just assumed it was some sort of military aircraft but later looked on line and saw no aircraft that fit its description. It was similar to B2 in appearance but appeared to be smaller. Was slightly afraid while house was shaking but afterwards just thought it was weird. I dont know if I have ever asked my relative if they can remember that day."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Country":"United States","Latitude":"37.087614","Date Submitted":"02/01/2012 09:59 UTC","Summary":"hoverd near house about tree level in front yard then shot away quickly diagonally,made loud noise and shook house","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35388.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35388.html"]}
