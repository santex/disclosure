{"Country":"United Kingdom","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI had fallen asleep on my bed with my curtains open, I woke at twenty minutes past midnight and almost immediately noticed a bright flickering light in the sky I lay and watched it for about fifteen minutes even getting my camera which unfortunately had a flat battery. The light was white with a brighter yellow spot that was sending out small beams of light intermittedly in all directions, then it would stop for a couple of seconds and do the same thing again. I got out of bed opened the window and carried on watching, I then noticed to my left another identical flickering light doing exactly the same thing and realised that when one had finished the other would shoot the lights out, some beams of light were arc shaped, it was amazing to watch. They were communicating with each other. I decided to message my sister on facebook who lives half a mile away to look outside because she is usually awake at the time, but unfortunately she didnt reply. After I had sent this message and looked out the lights were gone. Its the first time I have ever seen anything like this and I went on youtube typing flashing lights in sky and immediately saw something that was just like my sightings, Im so lucky to have witnessed this."],"Object Shape":"Flash, Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37915.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37915.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-1.544397","Date of the Event":"05/05/2012 12:00 UTC","Region":"England","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Two flickering bright lights communicating with each other by sending out beams of lights in all directions","Log Number":"GB-05042012-0012","Latitude":"53.810549","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.810549,+-1.544397(37915)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37915) map </A>","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Leeds","There were no other sightings in Leeds on or around May 5th 2012"],"City":"Leeds","Case Number":"37915","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"05/04/2012 08:17 UTC","Tags":"City"}
