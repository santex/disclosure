We were at a campground in themountains at a high elevation and could see the sand dunes from where we were. We were outside looking out over the dunes.2) We had heard there was UFOactivity in the area from a man who claimed to be a member of NICAP. We weredeliberately searching the skies.3) A blinking star.4) We were excited andventured further away from the campground to try and see better. We took acamera with us and took a few snapshots but they havent been developed yet.5)There were several. Two seemed to hover and pulsate light. Sometimes theydisappeared and reappeared above or below their original spot. Three others hada patterned blinking of lights. At times it seemed as though they werecommunicating. At one point a jet flew toward one of the stationary pulsatingobjects and seemed to be aimed directly at it, then suddenly went off track asthough it had been forced.6) We went inside and when we checked again they weregone."],"Latitude":"39.550051","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Lightning, Light","Log Number":"","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Summary":"Military aircraft chase UFOs near Sand Dunes Natl","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/792.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/792.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/06/2000 10:06 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.550051,+-105.782067(792)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (792) map </A>"}
