{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Oceanside","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"object was not lit, but 3 obvious red lights at apexes. Lights were off.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"01/12/2013 10:50 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out on the balcony having a cigarette, looking west. Due-West a moving object(s) lit by the street lights of Coast Highway caught my attention. It was 3 red lights in an equilateral triangle, non were lit. They were heading South, parallel with Coast Highway at around 200' altitude. I'd estimate the lights at 50' apart. I watched for close to 20 seconds before it was out of range. Estimated speed was 80 to 100mph. Having spent 5 years as a Merchant seaman I've seen many strange things in the sky. Meteors, satellites, Military and Civilian aircraft, but these 3 unlit red lights were the strangest thing I've ever seen in the sky. I was not drinking (sober 18 years) and am not prone to hallucinations."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/15/2013 10:22 UTC","Log Number":"US-01152013-0004","Case Number":"45215","Object Features":"Other","Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"33.175294","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.175294,+-117.362066(45215)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45215) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-117.362066","trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Oceanside","There were no other sightings in Oceanside on or around January 12th 2013"],"Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45215.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45215.html"]}
