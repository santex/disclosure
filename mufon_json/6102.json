We neared the road that we live on we both observed a blue white ball of light fall in a slight arch from South east to north west.. It traveled much slower than a meteor. My best estimate is that we observed it for perhaps 5 sec.We live far enough from the nearest city, being Adrian Mi, that we are not bothered by city lights and are often sky watching.We could not see where it may have landed. It appeared the size of my thumb nail on an out stretched arm. WE both looked at each other and ask \"did you see that\". This is not the first time we have observed anomilies in our night sky as well as day sky but the first time we have seen a blue white ball."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/28/2006 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6102.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6102.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"41.897547","Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Other","Log Number":"US-01072007-0004","Summary":"A blue white circle or ball shape fell from east to west in a slight arch","City":"Adrian","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Adrian","There were no other sightings in Adrian on or around December 28th 2006"],"Case Number":"6102"}
