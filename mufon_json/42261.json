Orb like objects with different coloration traveling threw the area. They disappear then reappear in different locations, but have had generally the same flight characteristics which aren't conventional to our known man made aircraft. They also leave the area into ascending into space with high rates of speed after they're done performing these arial displays. Will keep a camra with me the next few nights to try and catch this event on video if it continues."],"Date Submitted":"09/03/2012 05:09 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42261.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42261.html"],"Region":"North Carolina","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.093065,+-80.767316(42261)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42261) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Charlotte","There were 2 other sightings in Charlotte on or around September 2nd 2012"]}
