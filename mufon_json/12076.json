{"Log Number":"US-08152008-0003","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family was having a christmas party and we were outside at the fire pit approx. 10 pm. I was taking pics of everyone around the fire and turned around to take a picture of the full moon, which was in the Eastern sky, I thought it might look cool between the trees . I noticed something when I was scrolling through my pics on the camera but couldn't find my transfer cable for the computer . The camera is an olympus D-560 with a 10x optical zoom which was at maximum at the time I took the two pictures,Well I found my cable yesterday and yransfered it to my Hp desktop and zoomed in, Well, take a look for yourselves.
