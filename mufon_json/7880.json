I am a sociologist by profession and my husband is a Ph.D., currently teaching at the local university. What we describe in the following report is very much the truth. The sighting (and later learned sightings) have been happening for quite some times. We live in a small Louisiana town. This is our story: Friday, September 7th, 5:20 A.M. is when I saw the ���boxed��� shape light, appearing in the E NE sky. The size was about a half dollar held at arms length. I had had a restless night, battling a headache off and on all Thursday night. Finally, at 5 a.m., Friday morning, I got up, took something for the headache and tried going back to sleep. However, sleep wasn���t going to happen, so I got up, put on coffee and went to the back porch to wait on the brew. It was a very cloudy, hazy morning. We live on 2 acres, in a very nice subdivision. I was sitting in my porch chaise and observed something coming through the haze. We have very large pecan trees (about 45-50 feet in height) and just above, slightly to the left of one of our large trees, was a very bright light. It started out very dim, lighting the haze with a yellowish glow. The clouds around the brightness were light and fluffy, with a chevron shaped appearance. Then, all of a sudden, a very bright ���boxed��� shape light emerged through the clouds. There was no noise from the object; it just sat there. The bright light became very dim and the hazy like clouds reappeared. At this point, I ran back into the house and yelled at my husband to come see. I wanted a witness. He got up out of bed, came to the porch and looked out over the tree���in the mean time, I retrieved my digital camera which proved of no use because the object didn���t show up in the lens. My husband observed the bright object, sleepily said it was the moon and went back to bed.(Later to learn that he knew it wasn't the moon...just something to say to calm me down. I was very excited about the observation and was shouting at him on the porch \"what the hell is that??\"...it was 5:20 - 5:25 in the morning and the neighbors still sleeping was not the time to be loud.) Now I don���t know much about where stars are located and where the moon is suppose to be at 5:20 A.M. in Eastern Louisiana, but I knew it was not the moon���the sun was about to come up in the eastern horizon. There was no way it could be the moon. It appeared again as a bright, \"boxed\" shaped light and I watched it for a few more seconds and it finally disappeared through the clouds. Total time of observation was about 5 minutes. Later in the morning when my husband returned from the university, we packed our truck to go to our cabin in Texas. He was laughing at me for getting him up so early, but then later, as we drove to Texas, being very serious, he told me something very disturbing. He is asthmatic and goes outside many times during some nights to get fresh air and get over his attack. He told me that he had seen that same ���boxed��� shape bright light many times, located in the same area of the pecan tree, (give or take a few degrees) but had not said anything about it. I asked him if it was always around 5:30 A.M. and he said no���sometimes he sees it before midnight, sometimes around 2 A.M���he has forgotten how many time he has actually observed the bright ���boxed��� shape light. Always with no noise associated with it���always in the same easterly direction. I checked with the local airport to see what time flights come and go in our city. It���s a small airport and no major flights arrive before 8:00 A.M. from any direction. I then began to think back from the summer (July through early August) when we had our grandchildren with us for approximately 6 weeks. The youngest one, who is 7, kept asking me why a bright light would shine into her bedroom window. She had asked that question many times during her stay. I believed, at the time, it was the night light from across the street. One night, while putting her to bed, I turned out the lights, pointed to the night light on our neighbor���s garage and asked her if that was the light she kept seeing. She said no, grandma that is not the light. It is much brighter than that. So with the observation of the ���boxed��� shape light and now knowing that it appears at all times during the night, I am not sure what ���light��� she kept seeing in her room. I am wondering if the boxed-shape light has anything to do with her fears. I don���t know! I just don't know."],"Case Number":"7880","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around September 7th 2007"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"32.514761","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.514761,+-92.115501(7880)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7880) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Louisiana","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7880.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7880.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/07/2007 05:05 UTC"}
