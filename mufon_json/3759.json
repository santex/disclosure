I saw through the window what I first thought was an extremely bright star. What caught my eye was that it appeared to be twinkling red and green and white. It was in the south west sky from my perspective (in a small town along the Ohio River). I looked through binoculars and it seemed to be three very bright red, green and white lights flashing and possibly rotating. The lights slowly (over 20 to 25 minutes) moved lower toward the horizon and to the right. My wife and I thought maybe it was a satelite but it seemed much too bright and much too slow."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3759.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3759.html"],"Log Number":"US-08242005-0001","Tags":"City"}
