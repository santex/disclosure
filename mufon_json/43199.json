Directly ahead in the sky I noticed a large orange light in the sky. At first I thought maybe Mars was visible, but then I noticed it seemed to be moving towards us. It did not seem to have the lights of an airplane and was pulsating instead of the steady or flashing lights you'd expect an aircraft to have. As we were getting closer it suddenly veered towards our left in a SW direction. We then lost sight of it at that point."],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10122012-0025","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange light changed direction","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Essex Junction","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Date of the Event":"10/12/2012 10:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43199.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43199.html"],"Latitude":"44.506403","City":"Essex Junction","Date Submitted":"10/12/2012 10:54 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Vermont","Case Number":"43199"}
