I noticed it because it was moving and I'm very used to looking at the sky, satellites, stars, etc. When I first noticed it I had no idea what it was, only that I was fascinated with it and I immediately started telling my friend about it. The eight or ten or so lights moved randomly but consistently among themselves, within a certain distance from a center point, and the whole unit moved across the sky. I felt thrilled to be seeing this thing, whatever it was. I just watched it until it disappeared behind a big tree in the neighbor's yard."],"Summary":"Eight or ten or so lights randomly orbited around a center and moved together southward and disappeared behind a tree.","Log Number":"US-09092010-0001","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Eugene","There were no other sightings in Eugene on or around September 1st 2010"]}
