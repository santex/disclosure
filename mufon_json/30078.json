I watched one go up into the sky and noticed the starry sky and 2 odd looking stars. One star hovered near another star, but it flickered crazy fast. The other 'star' hovered for a while. It was blinking white, red, and orangeish. At first I thought it was just a tower light and a star, but I was wrong. About 30 minutes later, I noticed the light beginning to move upwards very slowly, then it stopped. About 10 minutes later, it moved slowly again, but this time it was disappearing and reappearing. I watched in awe as the orb thing seemed to shapeshift and turn multiple different colors. I told a friend but she just brushed it off as a plane or fireworks. It disappeared and reappeared a few more times and I am absolutely positive it was no fireworks. This shapeshifting thing took off above me, imitating a plane appearently, but it flew faster than a plane and made absolutely no noise. It disappeared behind some trees and I lost sight of it. The flickering 'star' just slowly started to dim until it was completely gone. The next night my brother had saw a shapeshifting like orange orb in the sky above walmart at Jefferson point. After the sighting, I couldn't let it slide. I did some research and noticed people all over witnessed a similar sighting on the same night or the night after. It was pretty epic. Unfortunately, I didn't have a camara or my phone on me at the time so there was no way to capture it."],"Case Number":"30078","Date Submitted":"07/09/2011 09:05 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.087363,+-85.130351(30078)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30078) map </A>","Region":"Indiana","City":"Fort Wayne","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Star-like, flickering, shapeshifting, hovering, moving","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like, Other, Unknown","Latitude":"41.087363","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
