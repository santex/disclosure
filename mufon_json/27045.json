They were very fast and made no noise what so ever. They flew from the south side of the sky directly to the north. After they were gone, several more flew bye and then nothing for awhile, Then one more flew by. We sat outside for awhile but nothing else has happened and I was curious if anyone else in Oklahoma City saw this."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"35.47689","Log Number":"US-12192010-0002"}
