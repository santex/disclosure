Well the thing appeared out of know where as I was looking in that direction, and saw when it appeared. It was moving in a small semi circle but hovering. It was not a plane or a helo, because there were planes int the air clearly visible as our creations, and not a blimp or jet liner. I am a pilot, and have never seen anything like this. I hoverd for a while, and just vanished straigt up in the air at an incredible speed."],"Latitude":"28.491858","Date Submitted":"07/04/2008 09:38 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.534437","Region":"Florida","Date of the Event":"07/04/2008 09:38 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.491858,+-82.534437(11428)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11428) map </A>","City":"Spring Hill","Log Number":"US-07052008-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11428.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11428.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"wittnessed arange color sphere hovering in sky, then changing direction, and vanishing","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"11428"}
