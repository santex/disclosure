{"City":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at the farm riding around checking my livestock. I was observing several large airliners because my farm is in the DFW flight path. For some reason I looked to the southwest and I saw an orange dot with no contrail moving very fast and disappear. It reappeared a second later and disappeared, again. I see large airliners all the time in which they emit contrails, especially late in the evening. This had no emissions and what was eerie, it appeared and disappeared. I never saw the object again. It was like it vanished. It was a clear beautiful evening. I look at everything in a scientific way, but this is something that I can not explain."],"trends":[],"Summary":"Fast Moving Orange Object","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03262012-0022","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"36767","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36767.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36767.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.972169,+-99.896833(36767)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36767) map </A>","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"03/26/2012 10:38 UTC","Longitude":"-99.896833","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/25/2012 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"31.972169","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
