I looked out the windw to see firetrucks going by, and got much more than I bargained for. There was a triangular shaped craft slowly gliding, almost hovering, from North to South. It had 3 lights, a white-Amber color, that marked the corners on the UFO. In the very center, an Amber colored light would turn on and off. The light would start dim, get brighter, then go out. As it did this, a searchlight emmited from it, going down to about treetop level. To my horror, about 2 years ago, I saw the same craft, this time much higher than the first. I knew the craft right off the bat. It moved at the same speed, and again made no noise what so ever."],"Date Submitted":"04/07/2001 11:15 UTC","City":"Springfield","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04232008-0017","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10494.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10494_submitter_file1__myUFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10494.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10494.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.106883,+-72.580081(10494)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10494) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Springfield","There were no other sightings in Springfield on or around April 7th 2001","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"42.106883","Longitude":"-72.580081","Summary":"Slow moving triangle w/ 4 distinct lights."}
