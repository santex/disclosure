{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright cigar like object with pulsating light hovered in place over West LA.","Region":"California","divs":["Sighting DetailsSeen on full moon night about 8PM from upper floor of apartment building looking west towards West Hollywood - WLA. At first thought to be the ISS until seen through binoculars revealing long white-yellow cylindrical cigar shaped object. Single red pulsating light observed at one end and what appeared to be a moving diagonal black stripe moving from right to left ruled out Venus or fixed wing aircraft. Brightness of object comparable to the full moon. Too large to be any helicopter. LAPD Helicopter flew past going south within one mile 700 off deck no relation to hovering object. Object appeared to be 75-100 ft or more in length. Distance from object 3-7 miles. No black silhouette visible to suggest blimp or modern day NT Zeppelin Object hovered for one hour before moving West for undetermined distance then returning to previous hover location then moving out of sight. Object bore resemblance to known sighting footage taken in last ten years. Witnessed with two other observers, the \"creep factor\" was present."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder, Unknown","Case Number":"50024","Date of the Event":"08/19/2013 08:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/20/2013 10:40 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50024.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50024.html"],"Longitude":"-119.411452","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08202013-0008","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.783991,+-119.411452(50024)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50024) map </A>","Country":"United States","Latitude":"36.783991","Source":"MUFON"}
