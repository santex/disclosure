{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn my way to the store to buy soda, I noticed an unusually bright star by the moon. As I walked I kept looking at it because it was not usually there. Then about 10 minutes later I saw it blink. Then it started to fly away in a straight line. It made no noise. About a minute later it flew out of sight above a pet store. It could not have been an airplane because it was silent and was stationary for almost 13 minutes. I cannot explain what it was."],"Case Number":"10688","Region":"Missouri","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Springfield","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"37.213367","Log Number":"US-05072008-0007","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Resembling a bright star","Date of the Event":"11/16/2007 09:40 UTC","Longitude":"-93.288639","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/16/2007 09:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Springfield","There were no other sightings in Springfield on or around November 16th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.213367,+-93.288639(10688)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10688) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10688.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10688.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10688.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Other"}
