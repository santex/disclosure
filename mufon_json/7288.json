{"divs":["sighting detailsi don't like reports without photos but i'm sure this one will be reported by someone who does have some. what looked like an extremely bright head light on a jet approached my house from the west. i live on powell butte, a point in the pdx flight pattern that jets use to line up for the air port. as it came closer it did not reveal the normal details of a jet and just as i was about to write it off as reflection, a commercial jet came into view at lower altitude and just behind the ball. then the ball and jet passed almost directly overhead. at no time, or angle, did the ball exhibit any detail other than light, it was completely consistent at all angles. it was clear to me that the pilot of the jet was carefully pursuing the object at an altitude and angle that allowed them a visual through their front windshield. as the two of them continued east, another very large jetliner appeared out of the south at very low altitude, almost at the tree tops, and was obviously avoiding a collision as the other jet and ball of light passed directly over it. at that point the first jet veered out of the normal landing pattern. there is no way that the airline pilots of both planes did not get a good long look at this thing, and considering it flew right down the middle of a major pdx flight pattern i'm sure the tower saw it as well. this is not the first time i have seen this thing\\s but because of the reference the jets provided, and the actions they took, i am certain it was not a conventional craft."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Tags":"City","Region":"Oregon","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-120.547161","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[],"Log Number":"US-06212007-0008","Summary":"Low flying ball of light in close proximity to jet airliners","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"7288","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.808633,+-120.547161(7288)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7288) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/20/2007 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"43.808633","Date Submitted":"06/20/2007 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7288.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7288.html"],"Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
