The white lights were somewhat triagular in shape and were following each other at the same speed, although they seemed to speed up and slow down at the same time. Three of us observed them for approx 1 minute at the most. We are in rural Canada where there are no city lights and are used to see many objects, including Satellites, but non of us have ever seen anything like this. That is why we are on your website for the first time. Since they were following each other, we assumed they were military, but the movement was not like anything we have seen."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19162.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19162.html"],"Latitude":"46.257525","Region":"Ontario","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"CA-09082009-0035","Date of the Event":"09/08/2009 09:40 UTC","Country":"Canada","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
