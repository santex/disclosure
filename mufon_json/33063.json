That night we went on a Halloween Haunted Hayride at Bushy Run Battlfield. Our appointment was at 7:45 and we got there around 7:25. We checked in, got some coco and waited for the hayride to start. I was looking at all of the planes in the sky and noticed a white light coming from beyond the trees. I thought it was a satellite. It moved slowly then started darting and slowing, darting a slowing, and passed slightly over my head. Then it reversed direction of travel for a short distance and started to hover and kind of wobble, making very small circles and half circles. I was mesmerized and my wife then asked me if I '\"saw that\". I asked what she was referring to and she told me and it confirmed what I had seen. The ticket taker told us to board the tractor and we didn't pay any attention to it furthur."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.355435","Longitude":"-79.631088","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11022011-0004","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"went from horizon, passed overhead, came back and hovered","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/02/2011 04:01 UTC"}
