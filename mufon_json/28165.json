I firmly believe what I saw was a UFO. It not behave like any airplane I've ever seen, nor was it a meteorite. I was facing due East, and the object - bright white at the time - came streaking across the sky directly overhead, going due East. I didn't hear any sound, and it must have been at a high altitude because it was nothing more than the size of an average star in the night sky. At first, I thought it was a meteorite because it was going so fast. However, then it STOPPED and stayed in the same position for about two seconds. Then, the object began to slowly drift to the south as it CHANGED from white to red. The object then faded completely black, and I did not see it again. I would estimate this event to have lasted around 5 seconds. I was not frightened at all by this experience, but simply feel - as I still do - that this was particularly weird and wanted to submit a report on it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.207102,+-77.185115(28165)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28165) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03082011-0011","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28165.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28165.html"],"Date of the Event":"03/08/2011 07:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"41.207102","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"28165","Longitude":"-77.185115"}
