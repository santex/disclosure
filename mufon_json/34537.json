{"Log Number":"US-01022012-0023","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":[],"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was already very dark outside, 6:27-6:28pm, according to my iPhone. I was standing outside in North Hollywood, California, leaving a photo shoot, when my photographer noticed three amber-reddish lights in the western sky, just below and to the left of an extremely bright star (or planet). Sorry ~ I do not know the name of the star. We assumed these lights to be flying over the Pacific Ocean. The lights looked like they might have come from any plane, except that these lights were flying in a perfect triangle pattern and they were definitely not white lights. These three amber lights slowly moved due north under the star, and two of the three lights dropped back out of the triangle pattern to form a perfectly straight line. Then this line of lights suddenly faded and disappeared uniformly into the night. This whole sighting lasted about 1-2 minutes."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.785621","Date of the Event":"12/29/2011 06:27 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Longitude":"-119.412772","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.785621,+-119.412772(34537)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34537) map </A>","Region":"California","Summary":"From North Hollywood, Cahuenga & 134 Fwy: spotted 3 amber lights due west, triangle formation that straightened out, heading north, over Pacific ocean.","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/02/2012 09:18 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34537.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34537.html"],"Case Number":"34537","Tags":"City"}
