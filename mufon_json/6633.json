{"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Massachusetts","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash, Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Glowing Orb and triangle","divs":["Sighting DetailsI just got back to my friends house (the friend lives 5 houses down from me) from riding my bike at a session at skaters paradise. I took my bike out of my friends car and started to ride back to my house when I looked up and noticed a glowing orb that was moving very fast then suddenly stopped and seemed to hover for a moment...then it suddenly flew back the same way it came from and merged together with a larger triangle shaped object then sped off really fast. There was no noise coming from the triangular shaped object which I thought to be very wierd. I noticed the Glowing Orb because it was the only thing moving in the sky and it was brighter than stars, I thought it might have been a meteorite of somesort. I was very frightened when I seen it stop suddenly. I havent told anyone in fear that I will be ridiculed."],"City":"Oxford","Sighting Duration":"00:02:03","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Oxford","There were no other sightings in Oxford on or around January 6th 2007"],"Log Number":"US-03262007-0007","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6633.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6633.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-71.858984","Date of the Event":"01/06/2007 12:29 UTC","Date Submitted":"01/06/2007 12:29 UTC","Case Number":"6633","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.120312,+-71.858984(6633)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6633) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.120312","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
