I would describe the object as looking like Venus, maybe a bit larger. It was a mostly sunny day but with large fluffy clouds passing by. As one of these clouds moved in on the object you could see that the object was solid as it was just below the crest of the cloud. The object seemed stationary, but maybe spinning as it did flicker or lost its brightness as the cloud approched. As the cloud overtook the object, the cloud itself seemed to slow down and accumulate where the oject was. After about five minutes of the cloud accumulating in that one spot it finally moved on and the object was gone."],"Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/08/2008 02:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.961335,+-75.158429(12421)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12421) map </A>","Case Number":"12421","Log Number":"US-09102008-0011","City":"Philadelphia","Latitude":"39.961335","Longitude":"-75.158429","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There was one other sighting in Philadelphia on or around September 8th 2008"]}
