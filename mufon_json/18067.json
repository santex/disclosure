We all noticed a little bright light that looked like a star, only it was moving. We kept watching, and it kept moving in a slow straight path. We know we were watching it for about 4 minutes because our friend called right after, and that was at 10:45. While we were all watching, we saw it dart very quickly to the side..like it was zig-zagging back and forth..but very fast, and then going straight again on its original path. It did that a bunch of times, then it started to fade in and out, and finally it faded out completely. There was no way it was a plane, and we are all certain of that. It was definitely a cool experience!"],"Latitude":"40.718963"}
