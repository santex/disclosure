Clear night so I was looking up at the sky. Saw something moving fast out of the corner of my eye. At first I thought it was geese but realized it was moving too fast. It was directly over me in seconds and could see that it was multiple circular objects flying in almost a vee formation but more like a boomerang. They were very dim there was no lights or flashing lights of any kind. They were very hard to see. The movement that caught my eye is the only way I would of seen it. There was no sudden directional movements they flew straight from south to north at a very fast speed. The event was over in approximately 45 seconds. I was confused for a minute and experienced cold chills and could not believe what I saw. The strange thing was no sound and no light."],"City":"Hamilton","Log Number":"US-03192012-0026","Longitude":"-84.551796"}
