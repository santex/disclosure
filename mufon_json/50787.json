We were talking and having a great time, when suddenly we noticed a very bright light to the North of us over an adjacent condo complex. It had two large round green lights, and two red lights of equal size on the bottom, which did not flash and were much too large to be from a traditional aircraft. It rose up from behind the adjacent building and came towards us. It then hovered silently for a few moments, rotated or spun in place and then moved off towards the North East where it could no longer be viewed behind the building. All six of us that witnessed it felt that there was no doubt in our minds that we were seeing something extraordinary and were completely dumbfounded by the incident."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/07/2013 09:45 UTC","Longitude":"-117.248752","Case Number":"50787","Object Shape":"Disc, Egg","City":"Carlsbad","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.09799,+-117.248752(50787)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50787) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50787.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50787.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
