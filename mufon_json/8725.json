THIS DARK DIAMOND SHAPE SMALL AIRCRAFT CAME FROM ALLIANCE IT CAUGHT MY EYE AS SOON AS IT LEFT THE HORIZON, AND SHOT STRAIGHT ACROSS THE HIGHWAY AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE AT A WARP TYPE SPEED AND DISAPEARED IN THE BLUE SKY AT THAT SAME 45 DEGREE ANGLE .MOST PLANE OUT OF ALLIANCE FLY NORTH AND SOUTH THE WAY THE RUNWAYS LAY..I THOUGHT THAT WAS ODD TO SEE ONE HEADED EAST . MY FIRST THOUGHT AFTER IT WAS OVER..IS THAT IS THE EXACT SAME ONE I SAW IN 1995..ABOUT THE SAME TIME OF DAY BUT IT FLEW INTO CARSWELL.. I WAS DRIVING NORTH ON SANTA FAYE SOUTH OF CARWELL AIRFORCE BASE YOU CAN SEE CARSWELL FRO THERE,,THIS UFO CAME FROM THE WEST SO FAST AND TURNED LEFT 45 DEGREE TURN LIKE I HAVE NEVER SEEN ,,NEVER CHANGING SPEED AND LANDED ON A DIME, SO TO SPEAK,, I COULD NOT SEE ANYMORE I WAS DRIVING AND THE STREET STARTED GOING DOWN HILL AND I WAS RUNNING LATE,I WANTED TO DRIVE OVER AS CLOSE AS I COULD GET TO THAT AREA AND SEE CLOSER BUT DID NOT..,ANYWAY I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS PLANE ANY OTHER TIME.. I HAVE ALWAYS KEEPED ONE EYE ON THE SKY NOTHING CAN FLY THAT FAST..THE OBJECT WAS SMALL DIAMOND SHAPE AND BLACK OR DARK IN COLOR.. ITS ACTION WAS STARTS OUT FAST AT THE GROUND AND DISAPEARS FAST AS A DOT IN THE SKY..AND CAN TURN A 45 DEGREE ANGLE AT THE SPEED.. MY FEELINGS ABOUT THIS,,I THINK THIS IS ONE GREAT FLYING MACHINE AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT AT THE NEXT AIRSHOW...IN 17 YEARS I HAVE SEEN THIS IN BROAD DAY LIGHT ON A WORK DAY TWICE IN THE FORT WORTH AREA."],"Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
