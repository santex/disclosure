It didn't dim or flicker it was just gone. It was strange because as soon as it left I could still see where it had been, like an impression or outline was left behind in the space it had just occupied. I waited and waited hoping to see it again but there was nothing. About 20 minutes later something that looked like the tail end of a falling star came from the south over my roof, but it was bright blue."],"Date Submitted":"08/03/2012 04:11 UTC","Log Number":"US-08032012-0004","Summary":"bright ball of yellow orange light dropped down under cloud cover hovered briefly and vanished.","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
