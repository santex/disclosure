So once we got home I got out my telescope and began to search for it. Once I was on it I couldn't see the onject I just saw the lights. It was flashing red,green, blue, and white. As i was watching it in my telescope it moved very fast in different directions. I then search again for it and found it. I then went to get my mom so that I would have another witness. She came out there and we observed it for about another 10-15 minutes. We then observed it without the telescope as we were watching it just vanished."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.691119","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16665.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16665.html"],"Summary":"A strange object with flashing light hovering with no sound.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.506875,+-81.691119(16665)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16665) map </A>","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Cleveland","There were no other sightings in Cleveland on or around April 24th 2009"]}
