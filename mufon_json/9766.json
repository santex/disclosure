It was traveling at 1 mph towards the preschool right over my carports about 15 feet away. It looked like an outline of a concoction of boxes. There were small Christmas tree type lights in every corner blinking randomly. The center of it had clear stained glass with a cross in the center. The center showed that there was light inside. Because it was dark in my apartment, and outside I could only see the outline of it. I mean I could not tell how thick it was. It really was very beautiful. I somehow got the feeling that the object was on auto-pilot, and that there were two or three beings arguing inside. I viewed the object on my elbow in my bed. Thank you."],"Log Number":"US-02282008-0026","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.780045,+-117.937958(9766)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9766) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"9766","Longitude":"-117.937958","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Garden Grove","There were no other sightings in Garden Grove on or around November 30th 1991"],"Date Submitted":"11/30/1991 09:15 UTC","Summary":"I rolled over in my bed, and I saw a very beautiful object outside.","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"11/30/1991 09:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other"}
