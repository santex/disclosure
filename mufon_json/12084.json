{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI lived in texas I was visiting my mom in cedar rapids IOWA. I went out to dump her trash in a dumpster. when I lifted the lid I noticed the stars were disaperaring. I put the lid down kept looking up and noticed that it was a huge, all the stars were starting to show up after it moved. It was very quite. it had 3 light blueish lights. So I ran in to get my mom to see it. By the time I got her out side it was gone. No one belives me but I know what I saw! I have seen 747s I have seen the space shuttle pigy backed on a plane! The object I saw made them look like a toy. The one that they show on programs looks just like it but the lights were diffrent. I've always wondered how big the stealth is and is it quite. Also can it fly slow? I'm not crazy, people look at me like, sure a yeh ok! This has bothered me since 1981. Thanks I hope one day the one I saw or others will be proven."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","City":"Cedar Rapids","Case Number":"12084","Longitude":"-91.661313","Date of the Event":"03/11/1981 09:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"black triangle, 3 blueish lights. quiet, bigger than a plane very wide","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"03/11/1981 09:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Iowa","Latitude":"41.98024","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Cedar Rapids","There were no other sightings in Cedar Rapids on or around March 11th 1981"],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08152008-0011","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.98024,+-91.661313(12084)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12084) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12084.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12084.html"]}
