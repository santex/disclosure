{"Latitude":"42.156858","Object Shape":"Triangle","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from work in Ann Arbor Mi on Pleasant lake road towards Manchester heading west when I noticed something in the sky to the south west, I pulled my car over to get a better look and it had advanced to my position very quickly. As it got near I turned off the engine and listened for sound, nothing. It seemed to be no more than 20 feet above the tree line, I would guess less though. When it got right over top of me I could see it was triangular with a solid light in each corner, one blue, one orange and one white. It continued north east and then I lost sight of it. There were no flashing lights at all just the dull solid lights in each corner. I have seen a lot of unusual things in the sky around Manchester for years but nothing as close to this. I have many other experiences to relate if interested."],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.156858,+-84.035263(24783)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24783) map </A>","Case Number":"24783","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24783.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24783.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/27/2010 03:40 UTC","Log Number":"US-07272010-0007","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Triangular object flew over my car towards the north east.","Longitude":"-84.035263","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Manchester","There were no other sightings in Manchester on or around July 8th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/08/2010 10:00 UTC","City":"Manchester","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
