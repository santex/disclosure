(on the idaho side) on the afternoon of march 4th, at about 2pm i heard what sounded like a large jet flying overheard (we have a lot of recreational pilots in the valley, so we see lots of cool private jets, etc.), so i took a look outside. toward the north end of the valley, i saw a smallish, white or light silvery\\grey, missle-shaped object flying very rapidly west to east. it matched the description in the previous report to a t. smaller than a commercial jet (maybe 1\\4 size?), white or very light, very low profile, no substantial wings apparent, more like fins graduating from the mid-section toward the rear, with a short, thick, black smoke trail. very impressive, and highly unusual to look at. like nothing i have seen before. so, i checked it out online, did some research, and have the answer - google \"new shuttle design lockheed martin\". there's several websites you can check out images, specs, descriptions, etc. it also happens to be stationed at mountain home airforce base over by boise, and when flying, cuts a clear path across teton county airspace on it's way to another air force base in south dakota. i'm sure those who have seen it fly can attest to how strange it looks in the air. it's also nice to see the shuttle program get a facelift and build a newer, sleeker, most efficient method of transport. the lesson here is look up! you might see something cool!"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/04/2008 12:00 UTC"}
