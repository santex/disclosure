{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at the lake with some friends about 4 of us observed this anomaly I was just star gazing when I noticed a red light to the west moving up and down repeatedly and the light started to move side to side the distance it was moving was several miles apart in a maybe a second and repeated to move up and down the side to side for about ten minutes when above us a military jet flew over head toward the object and when it began to close in on object to shot from straight in front of me to directly my right which had to be over 20 miles in the blink of an eye it to the jet to get from where the ufo had been to where it was almost a minute to get close to it again and when it did finally get close again the object zoomed back where it was then started to bob up and down again and side to side the jet tried to get close to it two or three more times all with the same result then finally left after the ufo had shot to my left and moved out of site in about two seconds only reason i believe it was a ufo is that no aircraft that man knows about can move perfectly straight up and down stop then move perfectly side to side"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31185.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31185.html"],"City":"malcolm Branched oak lake","Latitude":"40.97369","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08262011-0012","Case Number":"31185","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.97369,+-96.864586(31185)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31185) map </A>","Region":"Nebraska","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-96.864586","trends":["There have been no other sightings in malcolm Branched oak lake","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Summary":"red light bobbing up and down then side to side repeatedly Military airplane tried to chase","Date Submitted":"08/26/2011 01:04 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/09/2007 12:00 UTC"}
