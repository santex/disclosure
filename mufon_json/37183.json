IT FIRST APPEARED AT ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT MOVED FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. AFTER IT GOT ABOUT 25 DEGREES, ANOTHER ONE APPEARED FROM THE SAME SPOT AS THE FIRST, TRAVELING AT THE SAME SPEED AND DIRECTION. AND AS THAT GOT TO ABOUT 25 DEGREES HERE COMES ANOTHER. IN TOTAL, FIVE OBJECTS CAME UP FROM THE HORIZON, ALL FROM NEARLY THE SAME SPOT ON THE SOUTH HORIZON AND ALL FOLLOWING THE FIRST ONE. THEY GOT DIMMER AS THEY APPROACHED ABOUT 50 DEGREES TOWARD THE NORTH AND EVENTUALLY DISAPPEARED. THE WHOLE INCIDENT LASTED ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES. IF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN A SHUTTLE PASS OVER, IT LOOKED A LOT LIKE THAT EXCEPT THESE WERE A VERY BRIGHT RED GLOW AND EVENTUALLY GOT TOO DIM TO SEE. MY WIFE ALSO SAW THEM."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"04/07/2012 08:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-04072012-0016","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37183.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37183.html"],"Summary":"RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY FIVE OF THEM","Date Submitted":"04/07/2012 09:46 UTC","Longitude":"-83.672912","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.081791,+-83.672912(37183)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37183) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
