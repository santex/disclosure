After a few minutes we both zeroed in on this \"star\" that appeared to be moving over the lake from the south. We both asked at the same time if it was and after watching it a few moments, it was in fact moving. The orb itself looked as though it was a much brighter star approximately twice the size of the average visible star. As it continued it seemed to slow, brighten and turn towards the Northeast. The brightness was comparable to headlights at a great distance, bright but not harsh. We continued watching for what seemed like much longer then a few minutes. Do not feel as though I was missing time, but it was slower. We both remained calm and had a very large sense of awe and wonder upon seeing the orb. Very peaceful."],"Date Submitted":"06/05/2013 11:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.318108,+-79.559056(47912)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47912) map </A>","Longitude":"-79.559056","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
