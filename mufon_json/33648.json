Since this has been online, there have been many sightings of a large triangle shaped craft hovering over the refinery at night. In addition, there have been other types of crafts of a smaller nature around the area . One has been described by locals as a green fluorescent ball type of ufo. Just last Friday night my aunt and uncle watched one rock back and forth over the Roxana and Wood River area for about 45 minutes. Please investigate. There are many eye witnesses. Thank You."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Illinois"}
