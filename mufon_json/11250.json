Our front door was open due to the warm weather. She looked out the doorway and noticed something falling from the sky. At first she thought it was a shooting star, but it lasted far too long. she then said \"do you see that\" and pointed at the sky through the door. My husband then looked and saw the object. His comment was that it looked like the moon was falling. My daughter said it first flashed green lights, then glowed red like a meteor enterring the atmoshpere, then it smoked, then it glowed geen again, then fireballed. It finally dropped down between two trees to the northwest of our house. The object was so large that she expected to hear or feel a large boom when it actually landed, but we didn't hear or feel anything. Did anyone else report this sighting? We do live to the southeast of camp pendleton, but have never seen anything like this. If you could please let us know if anyone else reported anything, we'd appreciate it.
