{"Tags":"City","divs":["sighting detailsi take pictures of the northern lights whenever i can. on friday april 26, 2013 i went out to see what i could find. after a few pictures of stars and shooting stars i headed back to the townsite and set my camera up for one last shot. i have a canon 60d on tripod with a sigma 20mm f\\1.8 lens and remote set for a 2 second exposure. the pictures were taken approximately 5 seconds apart. i saw this light in the sky and snapped a photo, 5 seconds later i snapped another but it appeared to be going in the opposite direction (180 degrees) and then in the next picture it was gone. at two second exposure it was moving pretty slow compared to a shooting star which would cross an average of half of the view with this lens."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47412.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/47412_submitter_file1__April2620131.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/47412_submitter_file2__April2620132.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47412.html"],"Summary":"Light moving south to north and change direction 180 degrees in 5 seconds.","Region":"Manitoba","Date Submitted":"05/14/2013 12:07 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=56.040168,+-96.539777(47412)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47412) map </A>","Date of the Event":"04/26/2013 11:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"CA-05142013-0007","Longitude":"-96.539777","Case Number":"47412","Latitude":"56.040168","Country":"Canada","City":"Kelsey","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Kelsey","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
