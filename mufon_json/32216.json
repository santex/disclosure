I was looking at the sky, and noticed a large blimp looking object in the sky. It didnt look like it had the section on the bottom that you ride in. It didnt look like it was moving at all. I watched it for about 5 minutes It just looked like it was hovering. My first thought is that it could be a drone. But this didnt have wings and it had to be very large. It was very high up in the sky. Higer then most planes I have seen fly by. And it still looked large. I turned my head to see if my wife was coming. I looked away for maybe 5 seconds and it was gone. I couldnt see it anywhere. With planes or a blimp or balloon anything like that you would still be able to see it. This thing was gone."],"City":"Moore"}
