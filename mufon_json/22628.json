We parked in an entryway and two of us got out of the car. The lights appeared to our SW after approximately 10 minutes. After each episode of light-up then extinguishing of the lights, the lights would move on toward the SE towards Stephenville. A guess on speed would be app 50 mph. One of my daughters used binoculars and indicated that some of the orange lights were surrounded in a circular(halo)fashion by smaller, green lights. Both wrote reports and drew diagrams which will be included. I took photographs of the lights with reference points. A 3200% enlargement of one photo shows blurry triangular or \"V\" shaped lights.Although propped on a metal fence, there was still considerable movement. Further investigation of these photos may turn up additional information.Sighting lasted around 2 minutes."]}
