I believe that it may make a worthy addition to the MUFON database. I have no reason to doubt its authenticity, although I am not the witness in this case. This picture was taken in the fall of 2004, north of Montreal, QC, Canada, in the Laurentian region. The witness intended to capture the flock of birds in the center of the picture. She did not see the disc shaped object at the right, which seems understandable as the object appears to zoom by very quickly. Motion blur is quite apparent. I have attached the original photograph, as well as an enlargement and a digitally enhanced image (I produced the latter two pics) suggesting a 'classic' saucer shaped object, complete with a dome on top."],"Log Number":"CA-05202008-0003","Latitude":"45.885478","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10828.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10828_submitter_file1__Photo001.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10828_submitter_file2__Photo001-Agrandissement.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10828_submitter_file3__Faussescouleurs.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10828.html"],"Country":"Canada"}
