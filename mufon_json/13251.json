And as we were driving south on Highway 81 near the border of Virgina and Tennessee we both saw a stationary shadowy disc or triangle wobbling in and out of the wispy cloud cover a little off of the horizon. We both made comments about the strangeness of the object and then I (she was driving) pulled out my camera and shot the photo that is attached. As we drive the angle did not allow us to see it anymore. Total time of viewing was about 4-6 seconds."],"Date of the Event":"10/24/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Abingdon","There were no other sightings in Abingdon on or around October 24th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Disc, Triangle"}
