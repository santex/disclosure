As i was watching i suddenly noticed another star coming from the 1st star moving slowly to the 3rd star and when it came very closely to the 3rd star it became more brighter than the 3rd star and disappeared in about 5 seconds.I was shocked to see this and after about 2-3 minutes again one more star came from near the 1st star and to the 3rd star and disappeared in the same manner.Time was from 6:30pm-7pm.After this i haven't seen this inverted triangle stars formation,but have noticed strange objects flying in the sky,and i believe in UFO's as i had seen one when i was about 15 years old.
