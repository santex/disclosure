While my husband was unlocking the front door, I happened to look up across the street, which would be facing East, towards Milwaukee. I could see a bright silver object far off, high in the sky. I could only see it when the sun hit it just right. I called to my husband, and he also saw it. He had on polarized sunglasses, and could see it very well. I wondered for a second if it could possibly be a bird and just be closer than it appeared, but there was no way it was a bird. It was shiny, metallic, perfectly round, and moved rapidly back and forth. It was very far away. We watched it move back and forth and in circles for about a minute. Then it moved off very quickly down, away, and to the South. We could see it well as it moved off, because the sun (behind us) was hitting it so well. Happened at about 5:49 p.m. and last about two minutes. Our reaction was just, kind of,- \"Wow. we just saw a UFO. Crazy.\" We are not crazy, we really did just see this. Thanks."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/26/2008 05:49 UTC","Region":"Wisconsin","Case Number":"10930","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Milwaukee","There were no other sightings in Milwaukee on or around May 26th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Milwaukee"}
