{"Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"New Jersey","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["sighting detailsi pulled my car into the driveway. next i walked to the front of my house to smoke a cigarette before going in for the night. upon standing there on the curb, i was looking up at the sky watching the numerous planes fly overhead on their way to\\from new york in all likelyhood. i noticed a ball of light appear over the treeline approaching from the west and traveling east. at first glance i naturally assumed it was a a headlight on an airliner. however, i could tell as it inched closer that this light was not accompanied by any tell-tale faa blue and red flashing lights. in addition, this light was not projecting in front of the object as a headlight would, but rather shining like a star. i could hear planes flying overhead but noticed this particular object had no discernable audible sound of it's own, nor did it seem to have any actual wings, tale, helicopter blades, engines rotors or any other shape or parts for that matter. it was just a bright shingin light. in fact, as it flew overhead near the end of the minute to two minute event, a plane flew underneath it at much lower altitude (apparantly coming in for a landing at newark, laguardia or jfk) on a perpendicular path traveling in a southerly direction. it was quite obvious that these two objects were not similar in any way other than they were both passing overhead at the same particular moment. the object was flying at a relatively low altitude (i would assume 1000-3000 feet) and traveling on a seemingly unnatural perfectly straight path as it disappeared in the night sky over the treeline, into the clouds, on the opposite side of street. it was way too low in the sky (and it was obviously within the inner atmosphere) to lead me to think it was a cosmic event. i would approximate the speed at a few hundred miles per hour, but let's just say it was traveling slowly enough to watch it for a good one to two full minutes. while i have seen other things in the sky before on multiple occassions in multiple places, i found this object to be different in that it was just simply there. i have never submitted anything to mufon before. it didn't seem like it was trying to hide or evade being seen. if it was, it was doing a poor job. it almost felt as if it wanted me to see it. i've lived here my entire life. long enough to know that what i saw was not a plane, helicopter or any other aircraft i have ever seen. as i stated before. it had a consistent eminating star like quality (with no tail or trail), had no discernable audible sound that could be specifically attributed to it, and it had no tell-tale flashing faa required lights. definitely an odd sighting. i just wish it would have stopped so i could get my packed up camera to capture it on hd video. sorry i don't have any evidence to provide you. but i can say this...planes that fly over new jersey, for the most part, are either coming in for a landing or taking off. you hear them, you see them and you know what they are. objects flying into the clouds from the west traveling over manhatten on a path east are on a suspicious path over the atlantic without having made a layover transition either in new jersey or in manhatten. furthermore a plane on a transatlantic non-stop flight coming from the west would not be dropping to such a low altitude then rising again in a high air traffic are such as this unless it was planning on stopping for gas or switching flights or flight crews. definitely strange."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-74.13181","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23912.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23912.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/23/2010 11:35 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Fair Lawn","There were no other sightings in Fair Lawn on or around June 23rd 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Fair Lawn","Log Number":"US-06232010-0014","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Summary":"Silent ball of light traveling from west to east at low altitude.","Case Number":"23912","Latitude":"40.940376","Date of the Event":"06/23/2010 10:53 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.940376,+-74.13181(23912)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23912) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None"}
