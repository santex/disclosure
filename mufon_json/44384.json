The object went very fast north, I speed up to catch up and the object just went faster half way stopped in mid-air we thought that we were able to catch up to it then it went an an incredible speed making a zig-zag shape from north to west to north west in 90 degree turns. As the object was speeding up and turning the object turned into 2 exact copies, swirled for about 5 times before merging together and disapeering going straight up in the sky at that point we lost visual contact. I was excited since is been long time since the last time I had seen one, however my wife was in a panic mode not being able to understand what she just witness, I had to help her get her mind of the event and help her go sleep."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Object in the sky changed shape,direction and speed","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Colorado","City":"Denver","Case Number":"44384","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44384.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44384.html"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.744957","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Date of the Event":"12/06/2012 11:33 UTC","Log Number":"US-12072012-0009","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.744957,+-104.982618(44384)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44384) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"12/07/2012 06:44 UTC"}
