Overhead we saw approaching us in a west to east direction 6 orange disk shaped flying objects. The first two objects we saw we thought were a shooting stars, but the color was wrong and the flying was slower than a shooting star would be. Then there was four more of them, for a total of six. They were moving faster them an object would float (like a chinese lantern, which is what we thought secondly) and appeared to be flame lit from the bottom. They continued to fly into the easterly direction out over the ocean until we could no longer see them. The group felt like we had seen something very strange and all ask each other \"did we really just see that?\", of course we all had."],"Date Submitted":"06/03/2012 09:53 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"26.40215","Date of the Event":"06/02/2012 10:35 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"six orange colored disk shaped flew over Highland Beach last night in a west/east direction 10:35PM","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
