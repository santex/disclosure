I thought it could be a satellite but it was moving quite slow then about 10 seconds later just disappeared. I couldnt understand if it was a satellite how could it just vanish like that especially when it didnt go across the horizon line? I wanted to run inside to get my camera but it was already gone. The crazy thing is i was just watching a you tube clip of ufo sightings in Cyprus this month and once it had finished thats when i went outside and there one was! I sound like a crazy person but to me that was a message, the last time I would have watched a video of a ufo was years ago so theres some strange synchronicity going on here! I have never posted on a site like this before and it took me a while to search for one but hopefully someone else spotted it too so i can prove to myself im not crazy haha"]}
