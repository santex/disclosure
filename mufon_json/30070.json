I noticed they were going crazy trying to cover the sky with chemtrails. I was wondering why when all the sudden I look up and what do I see. A very fast moving white UFO like the ones in Britain moving away from a helicopter. It was traveling South West until it went into the clouds. The jet was right behind it trying to spray and catch up I guess. It was pretty amazing. I live in Timmins, Ontario. Let me know if anyone messages you with a sighting today! This was at approx. 12:30 to 1 pm today (july 9 2011) Dave"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-81.328095","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Region":"Ontario","Case Number":"30070","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/09/2011 12:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/09/2011 02:13 UTC","Object Features":"Dome","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.477171,+-81.328095(30070)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30070) map </A>","Summary":"White UFO Very Fast","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30070.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30070.html"],"Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
