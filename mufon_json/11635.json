It was a very clear sky and I was pointing out to my brother how well you could see the stars, when I noticed one of the stars slowly moving across the sky. The object, which at the time I figured to be a satellite, movied across the sky very slowly, and within one minute it had moved from one side of the sky to another. The strange thing about the object was that it was the exact same brightness and size of almmost all of the other stars ion the sky that night. It didn't make any hairpin turns or anything to that effect, but it was strange nonetheless. I would love to know if anyone else saw this object, and if not if there was any known satellite in the sky at that time. Just looking for an answer as to what was in the sky that night."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.222813,+-70.932868(11635)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11635) map </A>"}
