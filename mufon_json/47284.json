{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approx. 1925 hours tonight, Thursday 9th of May 2013, my partner and i were standing outside when we saw what we thought was a small plane. The only problem is that there were no red running lights and no flashing wing lights. After observing its flight path for a couple of minutes, it just disappeared. There was absolutely no sound at all. It was like whatever it was had turned off its lights. A short while later, a small plane was flying in the opposite direction, with red running lights and flashing wing lights. This is not the first time that my partner and i have seen this weird sight. According to my partner, he had seen another one a few minutes before i went outside tonight and we have also seen the same thing but on another night. Can anyone please explain to me what we saw?? The only explanation that i can come up with is that the RAAF are doing night flights with some sort of plane or drone - but it seemed similer in size to a large plane with its lights on but with no noise or flashing lights as would normally be the case."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47284.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47284.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/09/2013 07:25 UTC","Latitude":"-33.473134","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/09/2013 06:21 UTC","Longitude":"150.159798","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Lithgow","There was one other sighting in Lithgow on or around May 9th 2013"],"Case Number":"47284","Log Number":"AU-05092013-0004","Summary":"Strange sighting over Lithgow NSW","City":"Lithgow","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-33.473134,+150.159798(47284)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47284) map </A>","Country":"Australia","Region":"New South Wales"}
