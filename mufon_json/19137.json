I looked up, noticed it appeared to be a plane but the wings were not parallel to the ground and were not oriented correctly. I ran inside, grabbed my camera, zoomed in and took 5 photos. The one attached is the best one. The others were too blurry. I checked nasa.gov and the International Space Station and Space Shuttle were docked on this day but they were not to pass my home until 8:30pm (just after sunset). The photo was taken at 7:29pm and it was still daylight outside. I really thought it was the space station but after a day of checking, it appears not to be the case. Thus, it is unidentified but I highly suspect it to be a satellite in low-earth-orbit because it moves steady, straight, and lasted 3-4 minutes at most."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Dixon","There were no other sightings in Dixon on or around September 6th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-121.816446","Tags":"City","Summary":"Moved SSW to the NNE, steady speed no flashes, glows or odd behavior","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"19137","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"09/06/2009 07:29 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19137.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/19137_submitter_file1__UFO6Sep09_Dixon.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19137.html"]}
