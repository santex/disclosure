{"divs":["sighting detailson june 29th around 10:10pm i was standing on the back deck of my house with my husband. a bright light in the sky caught my eye, when it was almost overhead as it came into view from the side of my house. it was coming from the north heading south. both of us were amazed by how bright it was. airplanes almost never fly that path over our house as well. it was a yellow\\white light���. maybe three times the size of the biggest and brightest star or planet in the sky. it flew overhead at the speed of a regular airplane, but seemed low and was completely silent. i ran in the house and grabbed my binoculars. when i first pointed the binoculars at the moving bright light���it was almost blinding, and no other lights could be seen. no red, or blue lights like a regular plane. as the bright moving light flew out of sight i could see other airplanes in the area on both sides one flying to the east, and another flying to the west. this light was so bright it was the most oddest thing to see fly over���. especially in comparison to the other planes in the area."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.421577,+-82.900943(29789)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29789) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Very big, bright, silent light flys over my house.","Date of the Event":"06/29/2011 10:10 UTC","Longitude":"-82.900943","Case Number":"29789","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/29/2011 10:42 UTC","Log Number":"US-06292011-0017","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"40.421577","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29789.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29789.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
