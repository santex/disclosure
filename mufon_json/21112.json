On his desk was his daily reading file. I always read it, to keep up with what was going on on Goose Air Base. One day, there was a report on his desk that said a bright light had followed over a KC-135 aircraft while it was landing, then at the end of the runway, it streaked straight up to an altitude of 8,000 feet. It hovered at this altitude for approximately 20 seconds, then streaked toward the north at an estimated speed of 17,000 MPH. This sighting was by the Air Traffic Controllers (2) on duty that night. The copier was down, or I would have made a copy of this report. There were no more reports on this sighting during the next two month I was there."],"Date of the Event":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-12242009-0009","Latitude":"48.610186","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
