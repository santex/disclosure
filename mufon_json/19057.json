He contacted Mufon by phone during the actual event and did not have computer access. Witness stated that he observed an object through his binoculars in the NNE at about 7:50pm est. about 15 degrees above the horizon. The object was very bright, about as bright as Jupiter and about the size of Mars when it is close to the earth. The object was disc shaped with one red light and one white light. The lights were swaying in about a 20 degree arc about once every 4 seconds. The witness then grabed his telescope and continued to watch the object move slowly toward the east until he lost sight of it behind some trees while on the phone with Dispatch. Witness stated that it could be a weather balloon but did not know.
