{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Dubai","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside my house at a field cycling alone, when I saw a black triangular object hovering over a building. I was drinking water so I tilted my head back and I saw it. At first I thought it was a kite, but I then noticed a large red light at the back. It hovered in place. It was shielded by what looked like a heat haze only in that particular area, even though it was a relatively cool day by our standards. The object then flew away behind a building and I never saw it again. I was really scared and I went straight home and stared at the wall for about 40 minutes before pulling myself together and going on like nothing had happened."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"25.271139","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"46342","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Chevron","Object Features":"Louvres","Region":"Dubai","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Dubai","There were no other sightings in Dubai on or around March 14th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.271139,+55.307485(46342)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46342) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46342.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46342.html"],"Country":"United Arab Emirates","Longitude":"55.307485","Log Number":"AE-03212013-0008","Tags":"City","Summary":"Triangular UFO spotted over Dubai","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/14/2009 05:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/21/2013 03:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
