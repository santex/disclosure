{"Summary":"Three boomerang shaped lights dancing","Log Number":"US-09252013-0002","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI pulled into the Walmart parking lot in Arvada CO to make a phone call, looking east over the horizon, I saw three large lights moving in various patterns, one formation was chevron, then stacked vertically, at least two of the lights slowly blinked out and then blinked back on. The lights appeared at times to be boomerang shaped and bobbing and weaving at times. I do not know if there is a rational reason for the ligths but just wanted to report incase anyone else saw or knows what I witnessed. The changing formations make it difficult to have been a plane or helicopter as the it would have been difficult to impossible to achieve. Mufon, please let me know if there is an explanation or if others have reported it. Thank you!"],"Date Submitted":"09/25/2013 12:28 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/23/2013 12:00 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.808004","Country":"United States","City":"Arvada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Arvada","There were no other sightings in Arvada on or around September 23rd 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51057.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51057.html"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Diamond","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"51057","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.808004,+-105.085844(51057)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51057) map </A>","Longitude":"-105.085844","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
