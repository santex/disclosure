I heard this soft rumbeling noise coming from above. It was this large black triangle. Most people say they dont make nosise!But I have tenitius. So I have hearing problems. But I have a unique knack for hearing machine sounds. The sound I heard sounded like a quiet ramjet being used. The craft was traveling from west south west to north north east. At what seemed a realley slow pace.I suppose in relation to its size it must have been moving fast. As it looked to be a mile across. Larger than the town that it was traversing. I did not have time to take photos of it, and I did not tell any one about this incident until this summer. Knowing all too well they might think that I am a kook!"],"Longitude":"-122.364734"}
