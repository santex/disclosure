As it crossed 11W from a distance in front of us we saw multiple lights. Due to it's low flight we figured it was a helicopter. As we neared the IBEW the craft moved back across and we could tell it was circular. 4 white lights (bright) were stationary and below was what appeared to be a spinning section of the craft with smaller lights that varied in color. Craft glided over tree tops in a descending manner. We sped up and took the next road and it disappeared over a ridge. We attempted to locate it afterward with no success."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"02/15/2013 06:55 UTC"}
