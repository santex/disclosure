It was well after sunset, so the sky was dark. Just before the Whiteland exit, I saw through my windshield what at first I thought was a shooting star. The white light fell with a fast, straight, diagonal light trail like a shooting star. Then it stopped falling and \"bounced\" off in a completely different direction, appearing to move away from me. I could see the parabolic path of the bounce because of the light trail. When it came down out of the bounce, it disappeared as if the light turned off. It's hard to say how high or far away the object was from me, but the light was too small to be a plane by the percieved distance from my car while I was moving. It appeared to me that it was higher than the trees. I've seen other unexplained objects in this same stretch of interstate, so I wasn't surprized or scared, just curious as to what it was."],"Latitude":"39.550048","Log Number":"US-09142009-0010","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19311.html"],"City":"Whiteland"}
