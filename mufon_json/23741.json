detailsactually i have seen this thing three times over the last two weekends. the first time it was june 11 at night around 8 pm it was on the north side of i 30 and at that time i thought it may be a huge star but i watch the skies all of the time and had never remembered seeing a star on that side that large. my friend (*name deleted,sgonzalez\\cms) was riding with me and she saw it too. i brought it to her attention and she said maybe its a plane but we both noticed that it was not flashing any lights it was just a bright star like light just floating there not moving. i had never seen this before in that area and i have been in this area for a long time. i could see it between the houses once we reached my house, i had to go out about an hour later to get a blanket out of the trunk of my car and got this very eerie feeling like the hair stood up on the back of my neck and my arms and i walked all around to see if i could see the light or start and it had gone no where to be seen. anyway the next weekend she came down and we went to the hunt county fair on saturday night and we were with my sister and her husband and dad and i noticed it hoovering over the fair there were stars out but not really bright because it had been cloudy. i pointed it out to my dad and he said well it may be a really bright light on a tall pole but it was not that because, when we left it seem to be following us or going ahead of us sort of like a star seems to move to different sides of the highway as you drive so still did not think to much but as we traveled on back to royse city where i live it was over on the north side of 30 again and this time it did not seem to be as bright but more dim and when we got to my house i could not find it anywhere it had vanished. the next time i saw it was on sunday night june 13 around 8 pm my daughter (**name deleted, sgonzalez\\cms) had come to visit and was leaving and i walked her out to her car and looked up which i always do and it was right above the house roof next door and i pointed it out to her and told her about how it had been over the fair the night before. she left and i went in to get my binoculars and i watched it for a very long time there were air planes flying near by and i was watching to see if any acted the same way but they were normal planes with flashing green and red lights and this light is just there no flashing and yet it seemed to move from side to side very slowly. at one point it would be further to the left of the housetop roof and then move in closer to the roof although it was very far above the roof. i watched with my binoculars trying to see if i could see it clearer but i am very near sighted and far sighted too and astigmatism so with my glasses it did not appear very close but it did appear to be very bright looking through them but it has a red aurora at the bottom yet it did not flash just red light covering the lower portion of the light or start like orb. it seemed to be round in shape when looking through the binoculars... i had three of my grand children looking at it and my grand son said it looked like a star but he did see the red underneath it. one of my grand children acted like she was a bit scared so after about 20 min i took them inside the house where i told them to stay inside and went out the back of the house and the light appeared further to the back of the house next door and i thought well maybe just a star that appears to be moving but not maybe i am just viewing it from different angles. so i went inside the house where the kids were. after bout 15 min i went back out the front and the light was gone, i then went out the back of the house and i could not see it at first and i was talking to (****name deleted, sgonzalez\\cms) my friend about this on my cell and thought it had gone but then i saw it way in the distance to the south west just hanging there for about 10 min and it was more yellow in color like the atmosphere had possibly altered the color. i went back in for about 5 or 10 min and then back out the back and it was no where to be found. it may be a satellite it could be a spy aircraft but it is not a normal craft that i have seen in this area before. just wanted to report so maybe if someone else has seen this that we may find out what it is or to see if anyone feels the same way i do about it if it has been spotted by anyone else in the area. it seemed to go away once i was not looking at it and although it moved from side to side very very slowly so much that it seemed imaginary movements i could tell by the distance from the roof of the house that it was moving. it is very close to my house so that it is important to find out what it may be .. all i have is a phone camera but if i see it again i will take a picture and attach it here if possible."],"Log Number":"US-06142010-0001","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object
