This is about 12 miles West of Truckee, California. It was bright daylight. I saw a movement above me and thought it was a jet at first, but looking directly at it, I saw it was more than one vehicle. I observed 5 objects flying East to West at high altitude, and pointed them out to her, and she saw them also. They were intertwining with each other as they flew, like an elaborate aerial maneuver for no obvious purpose. There was no sound. They objects were rounded and silver colored. Due to the extreme altitude and distance, I could make out no other details. They were moving at a very high rate of speed, and covered the full sky until out of sight, in less than 30 seconds. The altitude where we were is about 6500 feet. We discussed the sighting, and concluded it was not geese, aircraft we knew of, or anything else known to us. It was the speed, and intertwining that made it probable we had just seen a flight of UFOs."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/13/1969 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"5233","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08142006-0001","Object Features":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
