I left the camera outside for a 20 minute recording on a tripod while I returned inside of my home. I didn't realize that an object was recorded until after I reviewed the video clip on my computer. It appeared around 5 minutes and 20 seconds into the recording. after almost 3 minutes, it faded away. I can supply you with the original video clip but the size is 658 MB. It's an AVI clip, frame size 640X480 at 30 FPS with a data rate of 14,780 kbps. I created an mpeg2 (mpg) file of the relevant 3 minutes at file size of 19.5 MB using Pinnacle Studio 11 video editor that I included as an attachment. I also included 4 frame grab images from my video editor.
