I observed a fast moving diamond shaped object moving very fast, high and bright accros the sky moving north to south. I could not tell how high it was but the object appeared to illuminate some of the clouds. It only took about 30 seconds from when I noticed it from a 11:00 posistion until it went out of sight. It traveled a very straight course no angels what so ever. I thougt it looked out of place it did not resemble a metior or satelight. I have worked nights on and off for many years and I have never seen anything like this before. I thought about it for along time before I took action to report it. I have worked an trained as a professional observer although I have been working as a civilian at the time of the sightiing due to some physical issues. I was hoping some one elese saw this object that could tell me what they thought it was. I would be happy to talk to a representitive of Mufon but I want to stay anonymous due to my occupation."]}
