{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy name is Jim Christie on March 19 2012 My girfriend and I went on a Carnival cruise to the Bahamas, on the last night out to sea when the sun was setting over the ocean I told my girlfriend to look at the sunset and I started taking pictures. I took a total of five photos and it was not until tonight that I looked at them on my cell phone while cleaning out old data. When I got to this picture I noticed the two lights and sent the photo to my computer to get a better look. I could not believe my eyes. Don't know what to do with this photo but I did not see anthing while taking the photo. Please advise Jim Christie"],"Latitude":"27.672347","Date Submitted":"04/14/2012 02:25 UTC","trends":[""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37459.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/37459_submitter_file1__UFO.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37459.html"],"Date of the Event":"03/23/2012 08:35 UTC","Object Features":"Dome","Summary":"Took photos of sunset while out to sea and captured two UFO'S","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-81.507254","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.672347,+-81.507254(37459)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37459) map </A>","Case Number":"37459","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc","Log Number":"US-04142012-0003","Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
