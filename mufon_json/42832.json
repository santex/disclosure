As so on as we got onto a main road i saw a string if very bright lights in the north east sky towards Fountain Hills, AZ. It appeared to be a towerr of some sort but there was not a tower in that direction, that high. We drove a little bit to the left of it and saw it was a rounded saucer like craft with 5 lights. The craft was dark and were were about 3 miles from it so we decided to drive towards it. As we got closer the 5 lights dimmed then got brighter then disappeared. That was about 730 pm. We drove to where we thought it was hovering, it was no longer in sight even as we drove back home. It seemed to be hovering over a lagged park of some sort. I was very excited my partner and I got to see something like this!"],"Longitude":"-111.824692","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Mesa","There were no other sightings in Mesa on or around September 25th 2012"],"Case Number":"42832","Date of the Event":"09/25/2012 07:05 UTC","Tags":"City"}
