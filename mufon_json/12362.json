She came back in the house and wanted me to come outside and view an object flashing red and green. I observed this star like object at about 120-125 degrees on the compass and about 30-35 degrees inclination. This object appeared to be moving with the normal star field motion. I watched this object for about 15 minutes before I went back inside. This object continued to flash red and green. The object was smaller than Jupiter in the sky, but had a more intense brilliance."],"Longitude":"-86.067011","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.755473,+-86.067011(12362)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12362) map </A>","Summary":"star like object flashing red and green","Date Submitted":"09/02/2008 06:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown"}
