I was traveling on I45 north passed 1960 toward Woodlands, TX when I saw a whitish flying abject. When I first saw the object, I thought it was an airplane, but it caught my attention because it has some sort of lighting frequency. I had my sunglasses at the time, I lifted it up for a second to see what it was but I couldn't see it without my sunglasses. When I put my sunglasses back on, I saw it flew into a cloud. If it was an airplane and traveling as fast as it was before, it should reappear on the other side of the cloud in just a few seconds, but it didn't. I wonder if anyone else saw what happening?"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.763313,+-95.36836(6786)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6786) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
