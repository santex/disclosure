{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/05/2010 10:20 UTC","Latitude":"38.974649","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were standing outside in our backyard. We looked up into the sky and saw what appeared to be a boomerang shape of amber lights floating across the sky rather quickly. The color of the object was dark like the sky but there were numerous amber lights on the bottom of the object. The object made no noise. It flew from east to west. We saw about 10 of these objects in a 20 minute period. I had some binoculars and could see the lights more clearly with them. The lights seemed not to be in any particular pattern. What started this all is that my husband saw the exact same thing last night. I saw the boomerang object floating over our house quite low tonight and that is when I ran and got my husband and son who both witnessed these objects. I was rather shocked that I saw the same thing my husband did last night."],"Case Number":"25698","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-95.23235","Tags":"City","Summary":"Series of amber Lights in Formation","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Lawrence","There were no other sightings in Lawrence on or around October 5th 2010"],"Region":"Kansas","Date of the Event":"10/05/2010 08:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.974649,+-95.23235(25698)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25698) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Log Number":"US-10052010-0016","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25698.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25698.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Lawrence"}
