The skies were totally clear within my line of sight, and I saw what appeared to be a plane...blinking red and green lights in the distance. I didn't think anything of it until I realized I was watching the object for 5 minutes and it hadn't moved. I got dressed and went to the porch, where I continued to observe this object for another hour. The object barely moved from its location, except for short, abrupt movements up and down and sideways. There was virtually no wind, and the trees and the frame of our roof were the reference point for watching this object that never really changed position...only jutted around side to side and up and down in the sky over the Continental Divide of Northern Colorado. As the sun rose, I watched this object slowly propel UPWARD until it was no longer visible because of its tiny size in the far distance, and the rising of the sun."],"Region":"Colorado","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Fraser","There were no other sightings in Fraser on or around August 29th 2011"],"Longitude":"-105.849876","Date of the Event":"08/29/2011 05:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-08292011-0026","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"39.962869","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Fraser","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
