not helos, not harriers, most certainly not fixed-winged, nor were they the newer osprey. as stated in my earlier report of last year (maybe it was '08?) i am very versed in most aircraft types having grown up as the son of a marine helo driver. i have no less than 60 scaled models of aircraft on display at my home in raleigh. these vehicles made no sound. stood stationary without any detectable movement in a 20 mph wind, and got close enough together to appear to fuse into each other."],"Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 11:34 UTC"}
