The object was very high in the sky, moving from the NW to the ESE direction. It was black and triangular shaped with very sharp corners on it. there was no noise and no lights. I asked my neighbors if I was seeing things and they looked up and saw it too. Some birds flew over head and this object was much higher in the sky. I am going to keep my eyes on the sky that time of night for a while. We discussed afterward if it might be a plane, but there was no noise..no contrail, didn't look like a plane. IT looked almost like it was gliding slowly. like a kite....but much larger than any plane I have ever seen. I watched the opening in the trees as my neighbors went into my home. I never saw it go through there. it completely disappeared behind the fir trees and the hills. this happened in Glendale Oregon, September 14, 2010 at 7:50 pm PST"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25434","Date Submitted":"09/15/2010 12:27 UTC","City":"Glendale","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
