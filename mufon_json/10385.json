The witness called on April 16, 2008 at 9:40 P.M. She said that on April 15 and 16 a \"ship\" had passed over her trailer at about 500 feet making a roaring sound and flashing lights from (apparent) antennae in red, white, blue, yellow, and green colors. There were two of these antennae in front and one in back, all flashing the lights as bright as fireworks. The object was gray and looked something like a helicopter, but had yellow square windows. It moved East, West, North, and South for two to three blocks and then moved back in two to three minutes, returning directly over Carol's trailer. This happened for two consecutive nights. On both nights, the sighting lasted from 8:20 P.M. until 8:51 P.M. During the sighting Carol's TV went white, but later the picture returned. She loooked around for other witnesses, but no one was outside.
