The triangle object soon started heading North and then started blinking blue and flew off at a medium speed, not too fast. around a year before this my friends family was in there front yard having a party around 9:00 PM and they all noticed 5 bright white lights really high up shaped like a five point star. as they watched this for about a hour the lights slowly got closer together and eventuallys they started spinning around really fast, came together, and shot out in all different directions."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.205368,+-80.246656(14230)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14230) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"14230","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Stuart","There were no other sightings in Stuart on or around October 17th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Three bright orange lights in shape of triangle.","Latitude":"27.205368","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Stuart"}
