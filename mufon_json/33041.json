I then noticed the speed that it was traveling at and that it was in a perfect line. Not like a balloon that was caught in a wind current. It then stopped and hovered for aprox. ten second before I had to move ny car since I was blocking traffic. I thoose few seconds it took me to park, the object left with no trace in sight. There were very few clouds that evening and it was still light enough for me to see for many miles above the horizon.I never saw the object again after that."]}
