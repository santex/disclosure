I saw at least 20 orbs going in a south to north direction traveling at the speed of an airliner in the night sky. The orbs were flying in a massive formation that appeared to consist of mini triangle formations. I pulled into the local boat landing to get a better look at what I was witnessing. As the orbs kept moving north, they began to twinkle out. Row by row they just vanished into the night sky (no clouds) with no trace of their existence. Once I arrived home, I wanted to double check the sky to see if any other objects were moving. Once inside I turned on the scanner to listen to Minneapolis center and the local airport. To no avail, nothing was being mentioned. I will keep a keen eye on the skies from now on."],"City":"French Island","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07142010-0001","Date Submitted":"07/14/2010 12:02 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in French Island","There were no other sightings in French Island on or around July 13th 2010"],"Latitude":"43.858299","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-91.260417","Summary":"Many lights in MASSIVE formation fly over town then tiwnkle out.","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24498.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24498.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
