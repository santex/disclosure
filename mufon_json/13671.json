I noticed a bar of lights on either side. Suddenly one bar of lights disappeared and the other bar stayed visible. I thought maybe it was a plane banking, but then the other bar of lights reappeared and I noticed the craft had not changed course. This continued to happen for approx 15 mins as I drove. Suddenly the craft appeared to stop and became stationary and I passed it. The craft would have been in the vicinity or even slightly east of Solon. Auburn or Russeltownship area. Personally I feel it may have been an experimental military craft of some sort."],"Date of the Event":"11/11/2008 08:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"11/11/2008 08:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"Row of lights either side disappearing and alternating then it stopped mid air","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
