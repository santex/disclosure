(im not really sure why i didnt pull out the video camera app instead)but as we were flashing our strobe lights at it, it made a 45 degree turn away from us and took off faster than i have ever seen anything move in my life! we watched the orb go from clearly visable and rather large, to smaller than a star until it wasnt visible at all. sighting didnt last long at all, 3-5 mins tops! ive claimed to my friends ive seen some weird things before, but this had to have been the strangest thing ive seen personally. considering going to by an hd camera soo if something like this ever happens again, i can be sure to catch it on video."],"Date Submitted":"04/09/2012 01:35 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.795509,+-94.265291(37212)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37212) map </A>","Latitude":"38.795509"}
