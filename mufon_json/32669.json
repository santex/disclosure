I was heading up towards the CTA Howard Station, I happen to look out the window and I���ve seen several strange looking lights up in the sky towards the east over by Lake Michigan. I tried to capture it on my camera phone, but it turned out so lousy that I see nothing but all blurs especially when the el train was moving so fast, the buildings that were next to the tracks they were right in the way blocking my view as the Purple line passes the tall buildings. I figured it wasn���t worth posting any, since they turned out so bad. Today (Monday October 17, 2011) I did NOT see any UFOs over by the lake on the CTA Purple Line and the same time, None whatsoever! Not even one single object in the sky��� Please Note** About this UFO sighting, I had already talked with Sam Maranto, who is the President of IL MUFON, NFP and State Director for MUFON International. He already knows all about this UFO report case."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There was one other sighting in Chicago on or around October 14th 2011"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
