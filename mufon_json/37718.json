I believed it to be too early for a star to appear and so continued to watch the object from a lawn chair in my back yard. It remained stationary at 115 degrees at approximately 30,000 to 40,000 feet AGL. After several minutes the object moved apporximately 15 degrees southward and remained there. I went into the house for a pair of binoculars. When I returned the object had moved back to its original position and remained there for several more minutes before it began moving in a northerly direction, maintaining the same altitude and exiting my sight at apporximately 10 degrees. The object appeared flat and circular. The entire episode lasted between 20 and 25 minutes."],"Longitude":"-111.086111","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
