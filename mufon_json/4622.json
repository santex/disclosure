I saw this big object coming into my view like it was just passing by. As soon as i saw it i thought it was a UFO. The object was like a disc with a very wide cylinder type of shape but not as wide as the base and at the top of the cylinder it was rounded. And in the cylinder part it sort of had window but each window was ultra white. I ran to my mom told her to come when we went to her room and it was gone."]}
