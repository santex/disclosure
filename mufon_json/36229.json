Lots of jets with strob light flashing in a spread out formation wing to wing followed 5 min later like they were searching for something. same as last time but quicker and more of them. I seemed like alot of private planes were in the area also this time. we actually saw the craft this time. Probably a government plasma test."],"trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were no other sightings in Stephenville on or around March 3rd 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36229.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36229.html"],"Longitude":"-98.197837","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"36229","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Stephenville","Latitude":"32.211128","Object Shape":"Cigar","Date Submitted":"03/03/2012 10:44 UTC","Date of the Event":"03/03/2012 09:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-03032012-0015","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.211128,+-98.197837(36229)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36229) map </A>","Summary":"dark in shap and circular, it actually resimbaled the picture at the top of this page unlike last time about 3 years ago.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
