{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Case Number":"26670","Object Shape":"Egg, Sphere, Star-like, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on the way back from a restaurant with my girlfriend and friends. I was looking out the left window of the rear passenger as I was sitting next to her. I noticed a strange orb of light move up into some \"clouds\" and I was shocked initially but decided to borrow my girlfriend's glasses to get a better look. I noticed another orb directly vertical to the orb I saw which didn't make any other appearance after I first saw it. The second orb remained there even after we passed by a semi truck. I've been questioning this same event ever since then till this day. I don't have any photographic proof of it. I would like to remain anonymous due to my concern for the safety of the people I care about."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/08/2010 08:10 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/19/2010 09:32 UTC","Longitude":"-122.412816","trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There were no other sightings in San Francisco on or around May 8th 2010"],"Region":"California","City":"San Francisco","Summary":"I saw an orb as I was looking out the window of the rear passenger, it moved swiftly upwards into a cloud and I blanked out for a moment before raising a brow then borrowing my girlfriend's glasses.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26670.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26670.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.78073,+-122.412816(26670)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26670) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Medium","Latitude":"37.78073","Log Number":"US-11192010-0015","Tags":"City"}
