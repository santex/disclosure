I was listening to the local football game in the distance when I saw a light that seemed odd to me. I stared at it for about 5 minutes before I realized it was not a star or aircraft(jet or helicopter). It was hovering flashing orange white blue yellow and red. It was very bright in the North-NE just hovering and after about ten minutes it started moving what looked like east. I lost it after it moved behind the trees in the distance and I came in the house to write this."],"Case Number":"51130","Longitude":"-88.957501","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51130.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51130.html"],"City":"Berlin"}
