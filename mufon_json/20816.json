As it moved backward I took a photo and it was lighting 3 bulbs under itself. Suddenly it became brighter, when I took a photo I could see 6 light bulbs under it. I was chasing it in my car, I drove to where it headed backward and I couldn't see it. I decided to go back home, which is the forward direction of that object and I found it agin flying foward. I followed it and the object stopped and lighted just one light, blinking and it looked just like a star, a blinking star. I watched it for 5 minutes and it didnot move so I thought it might be a star, and then it suddenly turned on the light bulbs again and moved to north east, I think."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11302009-0018","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"6 light bulbs under it, moving forward an backward, stationary, and moving again.","City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.634375","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.634375,+-89.394838(20816)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20816) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20816.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20816_submitter_file1__20091130peoriaIL.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20816.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path"}
