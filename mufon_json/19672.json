At first he thought it was a air balloon, but the object was too bright and hoovering quickly. The object was shaped like a diamond and changed shape. We was all just looking trying to make out what the object was. Kirsty has taped the object on her mobile phone, for about 20 minutes. It was not a clear version on the phone but you can tell it's not a balloon, and it's not a aeroplane. We looked at the sky so much i eyes started to hurt with the sun so we walked away from window and have contacted you right away. We would love to know what the object was. Is there anyway we can send you the recordings, so you can tell us what it is. Thanks Kirsty Gunning."],"Longitude":"-0.119765","Country":"United Kingdom","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/27/2009 11:49 UTC","Case Number":"19672","Summary":"a very bright diamond shape in the sky","Latitude":"51.515469","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"London","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
