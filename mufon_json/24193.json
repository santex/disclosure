Last night at 10:55 a bright orangish red ball that was bigger and faster than the ISS has ever been traveled from the southern sky northeasterly until it was below our line of sight. The ISS was traveling last night at the same time but traveling NNW to ENE so it wasn't the ISS. It seemed to curve from the south to east to northeast on a desending pattern, seemed bigger, brighter and faster than the ISS."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00"}
