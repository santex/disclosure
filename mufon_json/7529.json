After dinner we went out to see if we could find sea turtles laying eggs. It was a clear night and the moon had not yet risen. All of a sudden, as if \"it\" was calling to say look over here, this circular object appeared from the northern horizion. We were watching the slight glow to the east because the near full moon was about to rise and we both were drawn to look north. The object was round and about the size of a dime held at arms lenght. Not quite sure of its altitude but I can guess at 30,000 to 50,000 feet. Its heading was north to south at an increadible spead.From horizion to horizion it could be seen for not quite 10 seconds. Dark orange in color. No noise and no contrail."],"Country":"Mexico","Case Number":"7529","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
