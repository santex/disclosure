I got pretty worried and watched for only a few minutes. The object seemed to be moving like a balloon but when it did we could see light trailing behind it.It was trying to stay in the same place but would move about every 10-15 seconds or so.then the movement got more jerky after we had watched it for a few more minutes.Then we got even more concerned and come in doors. We live on Camp Pendleton and can't hear it make any noise at all.we know what a air plane and a helicopter sounds like.this had no noise at all."],"Tags":"City"}
