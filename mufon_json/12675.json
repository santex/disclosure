I was in the barkyard of my house playing with my brother when I heard what sounded like a jet but higher pitched. At first I thought nothing of the sound but become curious as it became louder and louder untill it had drowned everything else out. I looked up to see what was making the noise and saw what looked like a metallic disc. I watched it fly parallel to myself then make a shap turn and fly right over me, I then became very frightened, but my head down, and ran as fast as I could to my house. After I had retreated to my house I looked out the screen door to try and catch another glance but it had left. I how ever saw my brother was still playing and as if nothing had happened at all; when I asked him about the incident later that day he had no recognition of it at all."],"Summary":"UFO Winnipeg","Longitude":"-97.135064","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Winnipeg","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12675.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12675.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"05/11/1995 01:10 UTC","Log Number":"CA-09202008-0015"}
