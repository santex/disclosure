It appeared that they were traveling about 60 mph all in the same direction. In the middle of the cluster was a hugh triangle but its lights did not blink. towards the end of the pack was another small trianle, they all passed by then they were gone. I then called my friend in phenix city and told him to go outside and look up that they were heading his way he then reported that he never saw anything but a couple of jets taking off from fort benning. We looked back up and there was one by itself kind of way behind the pack, and he was traveling the same direction as well."],"Case Number":"38237","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Columbus","There were no other sightings in Columbus on or around May 18th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.558995,+-84.926607(38237)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38237) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05192012-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38237.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38237.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Flash, Triangle","Source":"MUFON"}
