I walked outside and stood close to it and the light got much brighter. It moved closer to the ground for a few seconds and then hovered again above the tree. It then slowly moved across open ground (parkway) and shot off out of the atmosphere. When I went outside it started coming closer and the light was almost blinding. There was no specific shape or any form of life that I could see. Strangely I did not feel scared. I am not looking for any publicity, but simply wonder if anyone can explain what I witnessed that evening."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43188.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43188.html"],"Log Number":"GB-10122012-0014","Date Submitted":"10/12/2012 02:45 UTC","Region":"","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Sighting Duration":"00:30:13","City":"Bury","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
