{"Date of the Event":"02/27/2013 09:03 UTC","divs":["Sighting Detailsstepped outside on the patio a couple minute after 9pm with my mom i know this cause the movie we were watching on tv just ended and we went out side to get some fresh air, i sat down looked towards the hills north west from where i was and i noticed a bright orange light flickering at first i thought it was a plane going low over the reche canyon hills as we are used to living near a military base and flight paths change over it constantly but the fire had sort of a hour glass shape to it the bottom slightly smaller then the top. I then thought it was a fire on the hill reason being is that we live in a valley and you can hear every plane fly over for miles from a cessna to a troop carrier, but this night was incredibly quiet and on second glance the fire was on the hill itself... so i told my mother there was a fire on the hill and i pointed it out to her we watched and she thought it was a spot light on the satalites but they were on the other hill further west we continued to watch what we thought was a beginning of a fire but it wasn't expanding like one after a minute or so it suddenly began to flicker more erratically and started to rise a bit from the hill the fire burned out slowly you can see from the fiery light it was sort of oval shape the only thing left visible on it was a pulsating light that flashed a few times showing that it was heading west from where it was then that light on the object disappeared as well.. following day on the news there was a small thing on the news over a dozen people saw a fireball in the sky in Riverside, Colton, San Bernadino and later that same night it was seen in San Diego, they had no answers to what it was..."],"Date Submitted":"03/01/2013 11:29 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","Tags":"City","Case Number":"45978","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45978.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45978.html"],"Latitude":"34.002764","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Colton","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.237601","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Colton","There were no other sightings in Colton on or around February 27th 2013"],"Summary":"fireball ufo","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.002764,+-117.237601(45978)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45978) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03012013-0003","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
