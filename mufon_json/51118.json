I THOUGHT IT WAS A FLOATING CITY, HELL I DONT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT, MY EXPERIENCE WAS SHORT YET IT FELT LIKE A LONG TIME. THE CRAFT HOVERED 50 TO 100 FEET ABOVE ME, I THOUGHT THAT THE TREE NEXT TO ME WOULD OF BEEN SHAKING OR AT LEAST THE LEAVES MOVING BUT NOTHING. THERE WERE 3 LIGHTS AND THEY SEEMED TO BE PLACED AT EACH POINT OF THE TRIANGLE. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO SOUND IT DID SEEM TO HAVE A HUM OR AURA AROUND IT. I AM WRITING THIS BECAUSE I SAW AN EPISODE OF OF A BUCKS COUNTY WOMAN WHO SAW SOMETHING SIMILAR AND A MAN FROM FLORIDA WHO MAY HAVE SAW THIS SAME CRAFT AROUND THE SAME TIME I DID IN 1991, I'M NOT SURE OF THE DATE, I WAS TO YOUNG BUT THE TIME SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT.
