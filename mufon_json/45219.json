The lights resembled an airplane but were brighter and blinked faster. They did not look the same as an airplane or helicopter. The lights appeared to be red and white. I asked my daughter what she thought it was and she agreed that the lights looked strange. She said that it looked like a star. We kept driving and as we were talking I noticed that the object was overhead. I looked out of the top of the windshield and saw a boomerang shaped object. I only saw it for a few seconds and then I couldn't see it anymore. I told my daughter to watch it as I was driving and she thought she saw a boomerange shape momentarily as well. It continued on a SE path and then we lost sight of it."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45219.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45219.html"],"Latitude":"33.654536","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"01/15/2013 02:04 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-117.688028","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.654536,+-117.688028(45219)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45219) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/14/2013 05:45 UTC"}
