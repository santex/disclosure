The sun had set and there were only a few thin clouds. I saw a light on the horizon. It seemed to be around 90degrees off the normal flight path of jets going past my parent���s house. I see them all the time and always look out for them. I could not see any craft, just a star like light in the sky. It was on a perfectly straight trajectory and It seemed to be doing a very high speed. When most planes go past my parent���s house, to the front and one side, the planes are leaving the airport and gaining altitude, to the back of the house, the planes are descending and preparing for their final approach. The light that I saw did not seem to be slowing or changing its height. It was completely silent. I waited for it to get closer and fully expected for it to be a small plane with its landing lights on. As it got closer, the glare from the landing lights would lessen and I should be able to see the smaller lights on the wingtip and fuselage. At this point I was pretty sure it was a small military jet as it would explain the speed and lack of sound thus far. As the light neared and I could see it from a 20 degree angle, the glare had not lessened. I realised that the light could not be from landing lights as they are directional. I watched one of the only hazy clouds in the sky as the light went beneath it. I thought it might have been a satellite reflecting light or omitting it. When I saw it pass under the cloud and realised it was obviously not a plane, helicopter or anything else I could identify, I pulled my mobile phone out and tried to record, but it didn���t work. I ran in the house and got my Panasonic camera out. I turned on automatic stabilisation, this makes the light zip around the screen as I try and hold the camera steady. I tried to film with only a small zoom, but could not see it clear enough, so I made a new recording at 12x zoom as I filmed it continue on its trajectory until it disappears over the roof tops. During the entire time that I saw the star like light in the sky I heard no sound of any type of engine, or any other sound at all that I thought was coming from this light. I could not make out any outline of an object behind or within the light. I did not see any other lights close to it or any silhouette. I viewed this object from two separate angles as it passed almost overhead. At all times the light stayed the same colour, shape, intensity, speed and trajectory. I watched it rise from one horizon and disappear over the other horizon and the whole thing lasted about 10-15 minutes."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"20017","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Blaydon","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-1.71867","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=54.962993,+-1.71867(20017)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20017) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
