It returned tonigh, the night of the 19th! I saw it when I happened to glance out my window, and it was in a completely different spot as the night of the 16th. It was now right in view out of my windows! I watched it until it disappeared to make sure it was not a plane or star. Just as the other night, it disappered starting with the outside of the circle and going in. I called my Husband out and just as I got him out it came back! We looked at it through binoculars and it disappeared once again. It did not come back a third time like the last one and it also never changed to red. It stayed orange. This happened at approximately 9:30pm and lasted for about 10 minutes in total."],"Date of the Event":"09/18/2011 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31908.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31908.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Lakewood","There was one other sighting in Lakewood on or around September 18th 2011"],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Circle","Longitude":"-105.065777","Summary":"Disappearing and Reappearing orb RETURNS!","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/19/2011 04:01 UTC","Latitude":"39.660802","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
