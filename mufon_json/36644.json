(10 minutes later) a second one just went by. with the first one we were just dumbfounded and didn't think to grab a camera. after the second one showed we couldn't find the video camera. i found it now, but we'll see if there's a third, probably won't be. i contacted a local police scanner enthusiast and he said two other people had reported the event and that the police were called. he did mention (not sure how he knew this) that the faa had no reports of flights in that direction."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.749269,+-87.704652(36644)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36644) map </A>","Case Number":"36644","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03212012-0012","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36644.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36644.html"],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"43.749269","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/21/2012 10:23 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"Wisconsin","City":"Sheboygan"}
