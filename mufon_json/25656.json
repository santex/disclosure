Heading south on MLK Blvd as i approached the hill at the Coosa Valley fair grounds (no fair in town they were completely empty) I noticed a light bright light bigger than the size of a streetlight directly above the hill as i got closer thinking it was just a star it streaked off for one second and disappeared. Thinking i was just seeing a shooting star i headed on to get dinner. Amazed and still looking to the sky i noticed that there were no other stars shining through. I shrugged it off and headed to my business then as i was approaching my home on Old Calhoun rd. right past maxway right before getting to Brinkley's auto i saw it again. The same exact light doing the same exact thing only heading in the opposite direction north this time. Each time i seen the light it only lasted for a few seconds but both scared the blank out of me."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Latitude":"34.260998","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Georgia","Date of the Event":"10/02/2010 09:50 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.260998,+-85.156123(25656)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25656) map </A>"}
