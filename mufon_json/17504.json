{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking a break on the deck of my house and suddenly appeared in the sky a luminous object shaped like a cigar. Its color was red and orange, varying slowly, performing a vertical movement of ascent and descent, the vertical movement was little, no more than half inch. Your size was about a finger major mine, about 3 inches. There was no horizontal movement. Appeared in the south west and could see it over the trees on my house, I figure that the elevation was about 30 degrees. The sky was completely overcast, and looked underneath the clouds. Did not deliver sound. Everything happened in about 10 seconds, and then disappeared. I regret not being able to provide more information on this sighting, but it was the first time that happens and I really surprised me. My first impression was curiosity, then to realize that it was not a plane was surprise but not fear, do not feel scared at any time and when the object disappeared special feeling of joy felt by the experience."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-71.308508","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Cigar","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Newport","There were no other sightings in Newport on or around June 6th 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17504.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17504.html"],"Log Number":"US-06152009-0013","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.499142,+-71.308508(17504)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17504) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Unknown object appears during 10 seconds below the clouds - the sky was cloudy.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"17504","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/06/2009 08:30 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Newport","Date Submitted":"06/06/2009 08:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.499142","Region":"Rhode Island"}
