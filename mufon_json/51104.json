{"Summary":"I worked for the forest service, on lookout. I watch the object for about two hours then it disappeared","Date Submitted":"09/26/2013 06:31 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI worked on the lookout tower in Southern Oregon. Another lookout named George Brown called me on the radio and told me to look in a specific direction and to tell him what I saw. The object looked like a ball bearing reflecting the light. if I remember right it was 10 to 15 miles away and looked about the size of your little fingernail. I watched it off and on for about two hours. I turned. my back and when I looked again it was gone. I was very curious but only George and I know about it because people would make fun of us. I know it was not a balloon horribly. It was in the middle of a deep forest at approximately 1 to 2000 feet in elevation. I have believed every since then."],"Object Features":"None, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"06/15/1968 01:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Union creek","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-122.408256","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51104.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51104.html"],"Latitude":"42.913342","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Sphere","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.913342,+-122.408256(51104)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51104) map </A>","City":"Union creek","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Case Number":"51104","Region":"Oregon","Log Number":"US-09262013-0014"}
