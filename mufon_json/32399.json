My friend Dave and I were laying on the benches in the back for about 30 minutes looking up at the stars. I noticed out of the corner of my eye the a section of stars seemed to disappear as if something was covering them from view. I focused on the area and noticed a traingular craft with a red light in the center of it, flying at a very low altitude (maybe 400ft above me) spinning slowly. It moved in a somewhat straight line, cruising by silently. I told my friend Dave to look at this thing because I wanted to know that I wasn't halucinating or imagiming this thing. Thinking back I also seem to remember that it had a small white light on each corner of the craft. It slowy cruised on it's way behind the hills beyond our sight. We sat there in shock thinking if the was some kind of UFO we just saw, and came to the conclusion that it had to be."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/06/2011 08:08 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Berkeley","There were no other sightings in Berkeley on or around July 21st 2000"],"Latitude":"37.879329","Country":"United States"}
