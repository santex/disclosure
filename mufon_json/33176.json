At 11:15 pm. just before i got to Walnut Creek I noticed up in the sky these 4 glowing white and red objects flying in formation in a row. They were flying east to west and spread out in a straight line north to south. The distance between them changed enough to show that they were not just one object. Also after a few minutes they seemed to scatter in different directions and lost sight. The objects were much brighter then the normal airplane lights that were in the area and seemed to be moving rather slowly but covered lots of distance so that after approx. 4 minutes, they had disapeared. There were clouds in the area but the lights were glowing steadily and very bright with a reddish glow on bottom and whiteish glow on top of each orb. These lights were unlike any I had seen before and very unusual in their formation."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"11/06/2011 08:12 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.877148,+-122.179689(33176)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33176) map </A>","Summary":"4 distinct glowing orbs flying in formation over bay area. white light on top and red light on bottom of each orb.","Log Number":"US-11062011-0015","Longitude":"-122.179689","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"37.877148","City":"Orinda"}
