It was not well lit but all three points had what appeared to be rows of lights. It was so low it looked like I could almost hit it if I threw a ball at it. It was VERY quiet and it seemed to be gone in seconds. It went almost directly South to North. The thing is that it was real! I really didn't think it was a big deal as I thought I would just Google it after work and find out why these things are flying around and see one some other time. Little did I know that there is no explanation for these yet. I have never had any interest in UFO's and still would rather not see these things. I am in my mid 40's do not drink or do drugs and I just went to the eye Dr in February. I wish I would not have witnessed this as I have enough going on. I hope to just forget about it now but what the heck was it?? Must be the military....."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/16/2011 05:50 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None, Windy","City":"Granite Falls","Date Submitted":"03/16/2011 07:24 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Granite Falls","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"A Triangle - Not well lit, very quiet, low.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28249.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28249.html"],"Log Number":"US-03162011-0010","Case Number":"28249","Latitude":"44.81"}
