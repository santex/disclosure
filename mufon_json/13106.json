There were also 2 planes in the sky and this looked nothing like them. It was one light and it was not blinking. All the sudden it disappeared. About 1 minute later it appeared again this time it was going the opposite direction going south and again disappeared. This is not the first out of the ordinary thing we have seen in the sky. We live in the country and are outside often. We've also noticed a light to the north of us that blinks orange, green, red, blue, yellow. It doesn't fly around, and it's always in the same general area, but never in the same spot. We've noticed this at least 20 to 25 times. I honestly don't know what either of these things could be. But being in the country and having full view of the sky you notice alot. We've tried to record this on our camera, but our camera is unable to pick these things up in the dark."],"Summary":"An object was flying across the sky.
