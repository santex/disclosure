My wife has seen them. It started a few months ago with one object now has inceased to several. Cannot tell how far away they are in the dark. I have reported these objects before here and it has gotten to be an almost every day event. I watch them until I get tired and sometime I get up through the night and look outside and they are still there. Air craft in the area seem not to see these objects or even if the aircraft passing through are civilian. These things give me a creepy feeling and to tell you the truth I am afraid of them for some reason. If the appear again and no cloud cover at night I will report them again"],"Case Number":"23728","Region":"Virginia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06132010-0009","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Bright light with colored lights in ring blurred appearance","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23728.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23728.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unknown"}
