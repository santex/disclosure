{"Longitude":"-99.900603","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 9:13 I noticed a flashing white and blue orb for about 32 seconds then kept seeing 2 green orbs flying somewhat side by side for about 4 minutes. I was watching the orchestra perform and spotted them overhead. Since I have had 2 other UFO sightings, I immediately knew there were UFOs. The green orbs were moving very randomly everywhere until they disappeared. The blue and white flashing orb was flashing very rapidly and was not flashing in any sequence. Since I have seen UFOs before I was not frightened or disturbed in any way. I lost the green orbs as they departed west into the treetops. I lost the orb when it disappeared into the trees.
