As I looked to the position where it had been before it was again there. It did change position and moved slightly more west from my position. It has very bright lights in the center and pulsating red, blue and white lights around its edges. It appears to be round in shape. I did not ever feel threatened by its presence. At 7:25 it disappeared (like switching off a light)."],"Case Number":"34229","City":"Seminole","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"27.846997","Tags":"City"}
