My son came inside and told me they were observing a UFO. I went outside with them and we observed a bright orange orb shaped object floating in the distance over the city. It was changing in color from orange to yellowish and orange again and would appear to stop occasionally and then move again. The object was not floating down but across the sky. I observed the light to be much larger than a light you would see on an airplane. It was not making any sound and the sky was clear except a thunderstorm was brewing in the northeast sky. The object was heading into the direction of the storm and eventually dissapeared. This was nothing like I have ever observed before. What is more interesting is was in the direction over HAAF base. We did not get any photos because we just did'nt think of it. Too weird and beautiful. Thinking back and wondering how to describe, I think best is, think of the sun setting and this was much much smaller."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29620.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29620.html"],"Summary":"Very orange sphere shape object moving across city.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"29620","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.085701,+-81.097464(29620)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29620) map </A>","Longitude":"-81.097464","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Savannah","There were no other sightings in Savannah on or around June 18th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/18/2011 10:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","City":"Savannah","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"Georgia"}
