The most unusual feature was an apparently circular opening in a cloud bank that was so regular in shape that it left us mystified. When the images were viewed full-sized in a PC viewer application, an object was noted in the clear area of the cloud opening near it's upper edge and left of center. It appears only as a nearly white dot. Enlargement produces an interesting but unidentifiable shape. The two images must remain my property but may be freely studied."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.291952","Date of the Event":"12/05/2008 01:20 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Tyler","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Medium"}
