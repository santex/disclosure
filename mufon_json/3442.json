It looked like it was going from east to west, or maybe southwest. I can t be sure. All I m sure of is that it was going extremely fast, faster than an airliner but the size of a Cessna or something. It was fairly high up, so I had a chance to run inside and grab some binoculars. It had two white lights on the sides of the craft, and two flashing lights on the top and bottom that blinked incessantly. The engine made a low-pitched looo sound, and when it passed directly overhead I heard a tiny voice in the very back of my mind that said y helo thar. It was like one of those afterthoughts you have, but in a distinctly different voice than my own, and it disappeared as soon as the craft went past me. It headed west, and when I tried to drag my friend outside, it was gone."],"Country":"United States"}
