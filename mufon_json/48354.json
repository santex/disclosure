I had stopped, shut off the camera and was just relaxing in the backyard when I noticed a large yellow-orange light come over the house behind me. I observed that it blinked very slowly, made no sound, was larger than a commercial airplane, lacked conventional aircraft lights and appeared to be one solid large light. Since I have regularly observed various types of aircraft from this same vantage point, I realized that I was seeing something very unusual. I quickly turned the camera back on and managed to get 3 photos before the object disappeared behind tree cover where I could no longer see it. The camera used was a Sony Cyber-shot 16.1 megapixel. Still shots were taken without use of the zoom feature. I had never correctly reset the date and time in the camera, so please be aware that the picture data is actually incorrect. The sighting took place June 22, 2013."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48354.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48354.html"],"Case Number":"48354","Summary":"large, silent yellow-orange oval slow-blinking light flew overhead","Source":"MUFON"}
