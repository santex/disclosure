{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving to Conifer from Broomfield, CO, I asked my husband to pull off the road as I saw a beautiful Sun Dog out the passenger side window and I wanted to take a photo or two. I borrowed his iPhone and took some snapshots. As we drove further, the brilliance and size of the Sun Dog grew and I again asked him to pull over for me to try to take photos with my iPad and did this a few times more when the Sun Dog split into 3 sections, prior to arriving in Conifer. When we finally reached our destination, we looked at the photos more closely and noticed they showed numerous white dots which neither of us had seen in the sky. He and I both thought they must be dust spots reflected somehow in the photos when I noticed they were in different locations on various photos . . . We still don't know WHAT they are and thought to share the photos with you."],"Summary":"While photographing Sun Dog I didn't notice the white lights that appeared in the photos later","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/25/2012 06:57 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.540749","Log Number":"US-11252012-0012","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Aspen Park","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Colorado","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44142.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file10__IMG0257.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file1__IMG0246.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file2__IMG0254.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file3__IMG0255.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file4__IMG0250.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file5__IMG0251.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file6__IMG0252.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file7__IMG0247.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file8__IMG0248.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/44142_submitter_file9__IMG0258.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44142.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/25/2012 12:15 UTC","Longitude":"-105.295558","City":"Aspen Park","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Case Number":"44142","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.540749,+-105.295558(44142)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44142) map </A>"}
