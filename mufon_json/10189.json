detailsthis is the first ive spoken of these events in over 15 years. when these things were happening and i tried to tell people, they thought i was crazy and people started treating me differently. im about may of 1988, i was going to pismo beach from the central valley in california. it was late at night, i was tired and wanted to go to sleep. so i pulled onto a road (bitterwater road) to take a nap. a short time after stopping about 100 yards from the main highway, a circular golden\\white light popped over the hill in front of me. i thought it strange because it was so bright, and had it been later in the morning id of thought it was venus. it took me a few hours to convince myself that it was remaining stationary over the hill and not moving with the background stars. a little before dawn it started receding from me straight up at a fast pace. when it was gone, i continued on to pismo but couldnt get the incident out of my head. at the end of the weekend, i was driving back to the valley and decided to stop in the same place again. shortly after i arrived the light appeared again. i got out of my car, walked around a bit, then walked toward the highway when i noticed a second light around the hill behind me. this second light was below the line of the hills (definately not a star) just hovering there. after about an hour or so of watching these lights i decided to continue on home. after turning back onto highway 41 and starting into the kettleman hills, i noticed a single light behind me the same color as the ones i had been observing, this was mainting a distance of a few hundred yards behind me and every once in a while it would disappear, at which point a car coming towards me would show up, pass me, get out of sight, then the light would reappear. this continued the whole way through the kettleman hills till a few miles before i entered the valley. for the next few years, i would return to the spot and almost allways saw something, i even convinced two of my friends to go with me, one of them we didnt see anything when we went, the other though, got to see both the light that came up in front of me and the one that was around the hill behind us, he also got to see them follow us through the kettleman hills, afterwhich, i could never convince him to come with me again. through the whole experience i was never afraid, more curious then anything. i even tried reporting it to lemoore nas though they just called the police on me thinking i was psycho. then one night i was feeling kind of down and went to one of my favorite spots to think. it is a rock formation in the sequioa park with stairs cut into it and you can see the whole valley from the top. as soon as i arrived i saw my lights in the sky, but there were more of them and not acting the same, i was afraid to go to the top of the rock, and shortly after decided to go home. the lights left me alone shortly after leaving that spot. i made it almost all the way home but was still shaken up a bit so thought i would drive around a little longer. i headed out to laton, not long after i drove through laton, i noticed one of the lights hanging over a field not far off the road. i turned down the next road that went that direction (davis ave.) i had only gone about 100 yards down the road, the light was directly in front of me, all of a sudden a blinding light was shining on me and all of my muscles seemed to tighten up on me. my next thought was that i had to get out of the car because a train was coming, i was very calm about this thought, and it didnt even register in my mind that i could not see. things went blank again, then my next moment of conciousness was me being aware of being out of the car (though not being able to see still didnt register to my conciousness) then something sideswiped me almost taking my arm off. things went blank again, and then i remember talking to someone (somehow i was aware of talking to the train conductor), and i remember talking to the police who were telling me since i was half way between fresno and hanford i could pick which hospital i wanted to go to (i told them hanford). through this whole experience i was extremely calm till i got to the hospital, once in the hospital i was terrified for no apparant reason. when i finally came to in the hospital, i found out that i had hit the embankment of rock that the train tracks rest on so hard that it had lifted the back end of the car onto the tracks, and a few hours later a train came along and wiped out my car. my face had hit the steering wheel so hard that i broke my face and it had swelled up so bad i couldnt even open up my eyes, the train had sideswiped me on the way by and tore up my arm at the elbow. after getting out of the hospital i went back to the site of the accident, there were houses on both sides of the tracks within about a hundred feet, and people were inside of both the houses, but noone heard a thing all night long. i never told anyone about the events leading up to that night and i havent been back to bitterwater road or the sequioa forest since."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/30/1988 12:00 UTC","Date
