Luckly I had just got my camera back from the repair shop. I first notice it, then called my wifes attention to it. It seemed lower when I first saw it and I could see that it was a cigar shape silver in color and had a short fin sticking out ouf the mid section of the craft. I couldn't hear any noise. By the time I got my camera out of my truck, it was a lot higher and futher away. It was hard to keep it in the frame because the camera has no view finder only a small screen to view the image and I was just pointing it in hopes that I was getting something most of the time. For some reason I looked like a white pill shaped object on the video? I do not know if this was a plane or something else. I almost did not submit it because of the dought in my mind. Is this a common image of a plane when videoed with a digital camera? Or is this something else?"],"Region":"Texas","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"McKinney","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/19/2010 01:26 UTC","Tags":"City"}
