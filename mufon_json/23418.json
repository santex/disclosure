This huge orange ball swerved to the left and flew down our road at about 300 ft high, it was bubbling and fiery and pulsing orange, I have never seen fire like this, This was a special kind of fire that i have never seen before, a bit like lather, then flew down in a straight line and did not roll but moved forward like a steady ball, as it went over my head i cupped my hands together to get a better listen but this thing was totally silent as it passed i could see that it was just as round from behind as it was from the front and the underside, this experience has had a profound effect on me for the good, yesterday i told my partner that i was proud to be a human, that is the first time i have ever said that and i have never heard anybody else utter those words.
