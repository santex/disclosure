I took 2 pictures of it and then started to walk. Something told me to stop and take 2 more. Later i discovered how this man had formed in the Photo. He has a Halo over his head! I am also a native and was born in the Hospital from where he appeared over. My grandmother told me a story when I was a child of the time she saw a man in the Cloud and thats what made her believe. I still dont believe but I am still freaked out by this."]}
