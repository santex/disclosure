John, my mother���s boyfriend, noticed something gliding through the sky. The object was noticed in the eastern sky flying in a SSW direction. We had visual observation of the craft for about 5 minutes before it faded out of sight. The craft was a silver cigar shape with a dark band in the middle. I could not make out any wings or a tail. It was completely silent, and there was no contrail. I live in the hills. Most planes go out of sight over a hill, but unlike most airplanes I see, this did not go over the horizon out of sight. Rather, the object seemed to get smaller and smaller, until it was no longer visible. There was a sense of confusion upon realizing all the strange attributes of this craft. I managed to remember to grab my camera and I was able to capture several photos on a Nikon D-3000 DSLR camera."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.580361","Log Number":"US-07282010-0007","Date Submitted":"07/28/2010 04:17 UTC","Case Number":"24810","Longitude":"-80.369805","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Metz","Summary":"Cigar shaped, apparently no wings or tail, no sound or contrail.","Region":"West Virginia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.580361,+-80.369805(24810)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24810) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cigar","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
