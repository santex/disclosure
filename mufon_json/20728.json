I went outside and asked her what direction in the sky, close to what star grouping. As I turned to face East, what looked and moved like a shooting star, but from bottom to top appeared and then disappeared. Then suddenly I seen what my sister had been seeing. It flashed red like, then orange and was moving in angles, changing directions, at tremendous speed. After a few minutes, it slowed down to a pace, as if to appear just a plane in the sky. At this point, I knew better. At least not like any plane I'd ever seen. It moved southernly towards Waco direction. I watched til I could not see it anymore. It appeared to have been possibly over Lake Whitney Area, which is East from my home.
