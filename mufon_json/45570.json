I first noticed the object as what looked like a plane crashing or falling out if the sky. It had red and white lights. As I got closer it swooped down near the tree tops at a 45 degree angle. It was metal and comparable to the size of a small plane, diamond or triangular in shape with some type of tail with lights. It had a strange depth to it. Many other cars were on the road that night who may have witnessed this. When realized it was not a plane I screamed. I continued to drive due to traffic and high speed. It was off to right top side as I drove off. I considered turning around to take pictures, but I was too afraid since I was by myself. I went home and told my husband and called in the sighting. No one has yet to come forward as I am hoping they will. I have contacted the local paper. I have been trying to deny to myself what I saw. It was disturbing and difficult to make sense of. Anyone who saw this, please report it. You will not be ostracized. You can call the local police or newspaper. I have also reported to the national reporting center."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.866704,+-73.924052(45570)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45570) map </A>","Region":"New York","Object Shape":"Diamond, Star-like, Triangle","Summary":"I was driving north on route 9 in poughkeepsie near academy street exit and saw what appeared to be a plane falling out of the sky.
