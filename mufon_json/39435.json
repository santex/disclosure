All of the sudden I see this blue sphere slowing moving down the road. It was not on the road but appeared to be hovering above it. It stopped and hovered near the top of my driveway, moved backward then forward, up a little and down a little, as suddenly as it appeared, it zipped off ascending and left a blue trail for a split second. It made no noise at all. When I saw this, my first thought was what am I seeing? I did not feel afraid, I just began to question what it was. The color of this sphere was a blue I have never seen before but closely resembles Lapiz Lazuli only more clear. It was brilliant and amazing. I just want to know what it was."],"Summary":"Hovering blue sphere"}
