On the ride down I stopped first in a place called ���Area 101��� where I spoke with a number of UFO enthusiasts about the contact movement���s program of interacting with the intelligence (presumably ET) behind the UFO phenomenon. From there I headed south and met with a young man who described his having positive interactions with what he identified as ETs throughout his life with numerous sightings that he claimed had an interactive component. After I explained to him a term that I have coined called ���prime contactee��� (reserved for individuals who can request a sighting and actually have one occur) he thought that he definitely was a ���prime.��� At my Mom���s house in Koreatown I brought my luggage up to the second floor and looked out through a screen window. It was 1:45 AM. The lights of the city reflecting off the overcast skies lit up the neighborhood. The silhouettes of palm trees graced the horizon. I gazed out to the west and immediately noticed a blinking stationary red light about ten degrees above the rooftops of the surrounding two story homes. For many years I have looked through that window on visits to LA and can never recall seeing such a light in the sky before. It was difficult to judge its distance as there were no landmarks behind it. It was relatively large, about a finger breaths wide at arms full length. In trying to figure our what it was my first thought was of flashing red lights on a radio antennae array some 3 miles to the west. They are not visible from my Mom���s house and besides this light was solitary and far too large. As I had this thought the light began to slowly move horizontally to the north. This was no stationary aircraft beacon sitting on an antenna. Police helicopters routinely patrol this part of central LA and the light was not part of any fixed or rotating wing aircraft. At this late hours all was quiet in this heavily residential neighborhood. The red pulsating object, circular in shape moved behind a tree. I waited for it to emerge into view on the other side. It did not. I waited and scanned the sky and listened intently for the sound of aircraft. None could be was heard. Was this just another \"random sighting?\" Or could it have been a consciousness mediated show of support for my networking efforts among the UFO experiencers that I like to call \"the contact underground?\" My guess is that it was a show of support because the next day I got a call from a contact team leader who told me that her skywatch team had a sighting of a round red UFO at midnight the previous night. It was less than two hours before my sighting. Coincidence? Perhaps but I don't think so!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.07086,+-118.293589(18410)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18410) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"18410","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18410.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18410.html"]}
