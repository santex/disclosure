{"Tags":"City","divs":["sighting detailsi was driving back home from doctors appt. in portage,wis.. traveling north on hwy. 16. right outside of the town area limits i noticed something odd in the sky. it was a beautiful sunny and partly cloudy day. taking furter notice of this huge cloud like item. more and more it looked just like a huge disc shape ufo. i noticed what looked like a top and a bottom ring band around its center section. proceeding around it. then i realised that inbetween these bands looked somewhat to be windows. going all around and each seemed to be separated. looked as if it was the same type of metal that those rings around the center were constructed from.it also had a top and bottom to the shape of half a ball. keeping my eye on it, i wanted to see if it was moving. if it was, it was moving at an awful slow speed. but more i drove the larger it seemed to become. that is when i came to the conclusion; i was only getting closer to it and not moving as i first thought. more i drove, closer and larger the ufo became. unfortunately i had forgot to grab my camera bag. before leaving home. could kick myself.for i know better--that's exactly when such things happen. i am drawing a picture of how it looked as i seen it. highway 16 leads straight into hwy. 13. upon coming up to hwy. 82 in adams county, which crosses a bridge over to juenea county in wis.. i could see that this humonguos ufo craft or mother ship was stationary. directly between these two counties. hovering over the wisconsin river and just south of the hwy. 82 bridge of adams, county. totally flabber gastic over exactly just how huge this thing was. numerous and i mean numerous football fields could have fitting inside this ufo. time i got home and grabbed my camera in hope--it was gone. now i think that perhaps i should have pulled off the hwy. and stood outside looking up. maybe then others would have taken the same clue. perhaps someone with even a camera phone. i was just in aw--to its size. would you be interested in my drawing? had you recieved any other reports of this same sighting? thank you for your time. sincerely, [cms\\tg\\pid]"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"23211","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.78562","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23211.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23211.html"],"Summary":"huge-disc shape ufo w/ windows all around,center. encased w/ clouds","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-88.783458","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05092010-0008","Date of the Event":"04/22/2010 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/09/2010 10:16 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.78562,+-88.783458(23211)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23211) map </A>"}
