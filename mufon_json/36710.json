I did, didn't see nothing for about 7 minutes, about to go back inside and seen it! Then called my girlfriend and seen another one like 7 minutes. It was really dark and could barely see it as the sky isn't completely dark, so I seen it cause it was darker then the sky... It's trim was silverish, made no noise, was really close and right above me, my mom, and girlfriend. It was traveling like at say 40-60mph so fairly slow for an aircraft. It also hovered stationary for a while. I have pictures but the craft couldn't be picked up in the photo as it was dark outside... If anyone else seen it, tell me! My grandma also seen the first one with my mom but went inside."],"Summary":"No lights, no sound, no nothing. Just black and barely visible at night with a sliver trim.
