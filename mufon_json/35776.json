{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI Was cooking dinner when I got over heated. I decided to go out on the balcony to get some fresh air. I looked up to my left and saw a very bright,flame like Pulsating Orange Orb Hovering silently below the cloud canopy. I called my friend and children from inside the apt to come and take a look. Very strange we thought for it was not a plane nor a helicopter. It was as if an orange star was hovering below the cloud cover. We then hurried to try and video tape the event. As my friend started to video tape the event the orb suddenly began ascending at an incredible rate of speed in a diagonal path up through the clouds and then disappearing completely from sight in a matter of approx.3 seconds. As if Camera shy. This is My third UFO sighting in the Denver Area. since Ive moved here in 1996."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.811945,+-105.122707(35776)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35776) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35776.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35776.html"],"Latitude":"39.811945","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-105.122707","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/13/2012 02:26 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Arvada","There were no other sightings in Arvada on or around February 12th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Arvada","Case Number":"35776","Date of the Event":"02/12/2012 08:05 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Saw Very Bright.
