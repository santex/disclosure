I took a second look at it right quick and as I did within a few seconds it disappeared like shutting off a light bulb. The whole event lasted about 6 seconds and it is the exactly the same thing I saw in Utah in June of this year. The object was about 45���and looked approximately 12-15 thousand feet and the size was about an eighth of an inch. The distance from me would be about 15 miles and that would be the western side of Sugarland. It was traveling east south east when I first saw it and when it disappeared. I���m going to put in a picture of the one that I took in Utah in June of 2013 and this one is exactly like it. I���m a field investigator with MUFON and state section director and retired as well. I up loaded 2 photos the original and a color code change and this is very real."],"Summary":"Went out to get the paper and saw a white object in the eastern sky.","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
