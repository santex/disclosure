It paused and then slowly flew away. The object had 1 blinking light in the middle back (white) the object had lights running vertically in an yellowish color. This was way to large for a plane even though we were by a very small airport. Stunned, we slowed down and missed the exit. The object went behind trees so we turned around. This took less thean 30 seconds and when we arrived to the point of the object, it was gone. We saw nothing else in the sky besides stars very far away. We drove east on highway 82 from the 289 intersection but never saw the object again."],"Object Shape":"Cigar, Circle, Disc"}
