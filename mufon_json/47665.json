It would go from an almost yellowish color to orange and dark red. It had no blinking lights. It seemed very high in the sky and moved at a steady rate and line of travel before fading out. Another followed minutes later in the exact pattern and direction as the previous one followed by a third a few minutes after the second faded out. They all reached the same point in the sky as they just got dim and disappeared. Many people in the drive in saw and watched these objects traverse the sky and no one seemed to have any idea what they were. We don't know if they made any sound as the sound of the movie playing was quite loud."],"Date of the Event":"05/25/2013 10:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"47665","Date Submitted":"05/27/2013 02:36 UTC","Summary":"Flickering Orange Objects moving over Wesern NY","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.057974,+-78.34048(47665)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47665) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Portville","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05272013-0006","Object Shape":"Circle","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Portville","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Latitude":"42.057974","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00"}
