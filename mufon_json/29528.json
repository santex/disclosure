I copied the videos from youtube; Kevinmc360 UFO and the oakland debunking video. No one has pointed out that these moving 5 star like objects passed behind a stationary starlike object. I have enclosed photos. If you can get Kevinmc360 to help you determine what the stationary star light object was, and where it is; that the 5 star like objects passed behind. It can help determine how far away and how large the 5 star like objects are. I seen this type with my own eyes passing behind stars before;and thats why I noticed it."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-122.262744","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Oakland","There was one other sighting in Oakland on or around May 28th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California","Latitude":"37.805864"}
