It made no noise and gave the effect like it was on fire, very slow moving as well. To me it seemed like a floating orange disco ball that traveled across the sky. I watched it for approximately 3 minutes as it got smaller and smaller and disappeared on the other side of the horizon. At first I thought it was somekind of firework since it was so close to the fourth of July, but its trajectory was to straight, and it was moving too slow and also gaining altitude the further it got away. I also thought helicopter but I was too close to it when it first appeared, and like I stated before it made no sound. My reaction was one of fear and awe mixed. I wanted it to come back so I could witness it again, but I was also scared that whatever it was might have known I seen it so well. I stayed glued to the sky the remainder of the night."],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.960422,+-85.322892(18352)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18352) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:03:04","Longitude":"-85.322892","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Colon","There were no other sightings in Colon on or around July 3rd 2009"],"Log Number":"US-07272009-0016","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Orange glistening ball of light","Latitude":"41.960422","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18352.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18352.html"],"Case Number":"18352","City":"Colon","Date of the Event":"07/03/2009 01:14 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile"}
