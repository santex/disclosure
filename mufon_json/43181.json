I took 4 pictures of the beach after the last short and did not see this at all. When I picked of the pictures the lady behind the counter asked my what this was in the picture. I first thought it was a balloon and later people told me it was something else. Some of the people in my swim activities have also seen them I found out later. This is the 3rd one I have seen in 3 years. I thought this is a very intersting picture. The three I have seen have been in the daytime. We live near a military base and I was on the miltary base at the beach when this happened. No other planes in the area that I recall and also one older couple on the beach.
