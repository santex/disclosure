He was shooting video, and when played back it showed several more lights surrounding the larger red light. All were circling it in a clockwise direction, while at the same time moving in unison toward the red light and then away from it, repeating this pattern for the duration of the sighting, which had already been in progress for about three hours when he called dispatch. Witness said his wife had filed a report (#18713) with MUFON last week detailing a similar sighting of four hours' duration, although I could find no record of it."],"City":"Denver","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"08/19/2009 08:30 UTC","Longitude":"-104.974843","Date of the Event":"08/19/2009 08:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.747804,+-104.974843(18766)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18766) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
