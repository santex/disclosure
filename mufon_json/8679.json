It fell from the sky directly to our right (passenger side of car) in both instances. The originating point was well above the trees yet did not appear to be falling from a great height. It did not have the projectory of a comet, but came straight to the earth, as if falling from something invisible overhead. It stunned us and we tried to find a reason to think it was a comet; yet it did not fall like a comet. At the second sighting, a week or two later in the same vicinity but a different location, two streams fell at the same time - one shorter than the other but falling side by side. We both agree that we saw a thick, florescing, molten-like liquid, that appeared to dissipate just before hitting the ground. We are familiar with the area and know there are no power lines or anything else overhead in both locations. It appeared to be totally silent, however, we did not exit the car at any time to investigate. It happened so fast the first time that we really didn't know what to think of it. If I had been alone and only seen it once, I think I would have thougnt it was my imagination!! The second time we were just speechless. We have not been able to come up with a rational explanation for what we saw. We have thought a lot about it since it happened. Again, it absolutely appeared to be coming from an invisible source way above the trees and not just free falling from space, and we both saw it TWICE."],"Date Submitted":"08/31/2006 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"35.997963","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
