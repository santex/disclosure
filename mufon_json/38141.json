Seemed to be above or higher in elevation than a near by vapor trail left by a passing jet, but below or lower than the highest clouds it passed in front of. The sky was pretty clear, with a few low level puffy clouds, and maybe just some very high elevation thin clouds. The object was a very small white light or something reflecting the sun. I would have thought it was a satellite moving across the sky, the way it was moving speed wise, and the straight line it moved in, but it was in the middle of the day, and Iv'e never seen anything move this fast, this high up during the day. Not a jet for sure. I lost sight of it when it's path took it behind some trees in my back yard. That's it!I've just never seen anything like this during the day."],"Date of the Event":"05/13/2012 12:00 UTC","Summary":"What looked like white ball very small or very high in the sky moving very fast below the cloud level","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.038903,+-80.166884(38141)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38141) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"05/14/2012 05:37 UTC"}
