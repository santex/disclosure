Only later did we notice what appears to be very bright two light orbs with halos and one smaller spherical object above them. I thought maybe the lights were from a plane, although they seem way too bright against a sunset sky to be plane headlights, and the small orb above and slightly to the left appears almost perfectly spherical and doesn't look like a plane at all, to me. Any information on what the researchers here think these objects might be would be welcome."],"Case Number":"39504","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There was one other sighting in Toronto on or around June 7th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Ontario","Date of the Event":"06/07/2012 08:33 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
