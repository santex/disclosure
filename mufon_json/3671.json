On our usual way home, we both noticed an extremely fast moving object moving from the north to the south across the road we were on. My fianc���e called me on my cell phone to verify what we saw than we got off the phone. We turned down a small road with no street lights going from the north to the south towards our home when we both noticed at our red light stopped an astronomical sized object just hovering literally right above our cars with beaming \"stadium lights\" shooting down at the road. I looked in the rear view mirror and suddenly it was gone. We both got on the cell phone again to verify what we saw. We looked on your website and found that their was another sighting just three weeks ago here in Sarasota, Florida on May 29, 2005. Seems very weird to us two sightings in such a small amount of time."],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"Large round object with \"stadium lights\" flies over cars","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
