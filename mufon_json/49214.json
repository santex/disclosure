It's light was visible for approximately 3 sec or so, and then it completely disappeared. After about 5-8 secs it reappeared a little farther north and slightly to the west. Again, it was silent, steady, and bright. Like before, after a few sec it disappeared. It repeated everything I mentioned before for a 3rd time except for this time right before it disappeared the light brightened and intensified. When this occurred an overwhelming feeling of awe came over me...I even spoke aloud \"This is incredible!!\" After it vanished I think it reappeared once more, but I could barely see it...the distance was far away. The while sighting itself lasted about a min or so."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49214.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49214.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date Submitted":"07/27/2013 01:06 UTC","Latitude":"37.858319","City":"Nevada","Longitude":"-94.318468","Date of the Event":"07/26/2013 10:50 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"49214","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Missouri","Log Number":"US-07272013-0002","Source":"MUFON"}
