I looked out my back sliding glass window on the upper level and noticed some burning lights coming from the South, heading towards me. I went outside to take a look and there were multiple lights emitting from the South moving North crossing over my house and dissipating through the cloud line. at first I was taken back by the sightings as they kept coming at random times one after another and sometimes and Twos. I was baffled at first but after observing them for quite some time I came to the conclusion that these were some sort of candles or flaming objects attached to balloons that had been released not too far away and were floating from the South to the North. The balls of light or (fireballs) began extinguishing after hitting the cloud line where more moisture would be present."],"Date of the Event":"11/18/2013 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"52301","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.076407,+-121.593481(52301)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52301) map </A>","City":"Yuba City","Latitude":"39.076407","Summary":"fireball type lights originating from South horizon at random intervalls following same flight pattern with inconsistent speed but minimal change, headed North where dissipated through cloud line.","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Yuba City","There was one other sighting in Yuba City on or around November 18th 2013"],"Longitude":"-121.593481","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52301.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52301.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
