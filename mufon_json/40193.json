We had seen one of these orange lights a few minutes before but dismissed it as a plane but after seeing several more close together heading in the same direction we thought it may be something else. The objects appeared in the western sky and had sort of a fire-like color to them (reddish orange). They had a slight flicker like stars and headed north to where they disappeared. They all vanished after passing the same point in the northern sky. We were pretty shocked at what we were seeing. We tried guessing what they could be but just couldn't decide on any one thing. There was one object in the first sighting (which we thought was the plane) then 3-4 about 5 minutes later. About 5 minutes after that we saw another 9 separated by a few inches in the sky. We hung around a while longer and eventually saw one final one about 20 minutes after the large sighting (heading from the east to the north)."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"14+ orange glowing objects sighted, appeared in the west, headed north then disappeared","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:03 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Case Number":"40193","Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 02:59 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.709465,+-121.274261(40193)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40193) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Citrus Heights","There were no other sightings in Citrus Heights on or around July 4th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-07052012-0031","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40193.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40193.html"]}
