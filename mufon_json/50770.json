This was a star-like object moving NE, as bright as Venus on a clear night. The white light was solid, and moving in a straight path, with no sound. The object was recorded on my cell phone. However, I made the mistake of trying to focus on it and follow it, instead of standing still. The video is blurred after a few seconds. There are three versions to compare. The original, one with edge detection, and one with a sepia filter. There are two nearby airports and I see planes every day. However, this was no plane."],"Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.53913,+-95.191295(50770)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50770) map </A>","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Friendswood","There were no other sightings in Friendswood on or around September 12th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
