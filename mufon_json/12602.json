Craft was almost above us. (The clouds were very low, it was misting) My daughter (age 10) said, \"look, cool,stealth bomber\" Well, thats weird, there would be no stealth bombers in Bemidji MN at 8 am. Like I said, it was low, then as soon as I looked up to see it, it darted up in front of us, moving to the north west into the clouds, fast. No airplane could move that fast, that low. No sound. My daughter drew a picture. It looks just like a boomerang, charcoal black in color. No lights were noticed. It all happened in like 5 seconds. We thought it was neat to see a stealth bomber- but then realized no boomerang shaped stealth bomber would be here. Either way- Either craft, its unexplainable."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
