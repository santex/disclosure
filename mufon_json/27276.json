This was the similar thing I witnessed in Fort Knox in '69. Although my sighting I really can't say it was round or saucer shape. It did leave the same mark on the ground. Round, burnt like grass. Can't remember if there was white ash but distincly remember the deadened ring of grass. I got ridiculed by others looking at it and I was young. Fourth- fifth grade at the time so I stowed it away for many years until my report last year here @ MUFON. I just wanted the similarities pointed out. Thanks, John"]}
