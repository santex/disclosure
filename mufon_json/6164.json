was 22 years old. this event occurred in southwest wayne co., mi. which was at that time and still somewhat is suburban\\rural. i was travelling west on sibley rd., and had just crossed u.s. 24, known as telegraph rd. i was in a line of 4 cars, the first three in a group approx. 100 feet long, the forth back about an 1\\8 of a mile behind. we had a green light, traversed the 'crown' of the cross st. and continued west about 1\\8th of a mile. to my immediate right, somewhat on the outer peripherery of my line of sight, i saw a light travelling at a high rate of speed at approx. a 35 degree angle downword. it was behind a patch of woods about 200-300 feet to the north of the road i was on. i had grown up and lived all my life at that time exactly 6 miles due south of detroit-metro airport, i imediately thought, \"well i'm about to see my first plane crash\". at that same instant i lost sight of the object for no more that 2-3 seconds, then i saw it begin a slow climb over the trees at a very step angle. also, it was coming at an angle back towards me, in other words not only had it changed altitude at a very steep angle, it also did an incredible change of direction from due west downward to very near the ground below the tops of the trees, to now climbing at a steep angle and travelling south-southeast. as it crossed the street i was on, it was going no more than 30 mph at a height of no more than 200 feet. i was the third car in a line of 4 cars, and i noticed that both cars in front of me had stopped, as well as myself, and i had pulled somewhat over with 2 tires on the shoulder, and 2 tires still on the road. i had my window down about 3 inches, as i was a smoker at that time, yet as this craft crossed the road no more than 100 feet ahead of me and continued s-se, it made absolutely no noise. i did feel what i have described as a vibration or hum in my sternum\\chest, but no noise. i had to 'cran' my neck to my extreme left to continue to track it. when it was about 150 ft to my left\\rear and about 200 ft high, it stopped and just hovered. again, no noise. i got a good look at this craft. it was metallic, but i couldn't say if it was gray or not due to the poor ambient light. it's shape was round or oval but it had a distinct flat end to it. the best way to describe it would be if you had a round or slightly oval sting ray fish, and you chopped off 1\\3 of it. it was about 40ft. in circumference, and about 9-11 ft high. it had some type of bubble or 'hump' in the middle, about 10 feet around and perhaps 3 ft. high, which looked to be made of a slightly different material or color, which appeared to be in the exact middle of the craft. upon the 'hump' was a red light that glowed bright, then dim ,bright, dim. it did not shut off or strobe , just sort of increased and then decreased in intensity. the thing that struck me most was, there was a red light and a green light that appeared to be port and starboard markers, which seemed to be approx 2-3 feet up on either side of the top surface, on a type of post or mast. they did not blink or change in intensity, they were not very bright, but they were red and green for sure. the flat'end' or rear of this craft,had three hugh white lights,(they were about 3 feet in diameter) that seemed to be flashing in some type of code or pattern, each of the 3 would flash in an independant pattern. my thought was that this was the rear or propulsion part of this craft, but i'm not sure of that. it hovered yet this flashing pattern continued. i observed this for no more than 5-7 sec of hovering time, when the forth car slowly passed me. it seemed that that driver was not aware of why the 2 cars and myself were stopped there, but when that car passed me, it drew my attention to the road ahead of me, at which time i realized that the 2 autos ahead of me had also left, as all i saw were taillights ahead of me. i glanced back at the craft, and i became aware that it was just me and this thing there at that time, and i'm not proud to say, but i felt very apprehensive and scared and i floored it and left the craft hovering there. as far as i know, it did not follow or tail me, and i have no idea how long it remained there. my thought at that time, after some reflection, which i still feel to this day, is that having grown up just a few miles from one of the largest airports in the country, and i must add i continued to live in that area until i was 42, and having seen almost every type of commercial and many military aircraft,(metro airport was a afng base when i was a child\\teen) in every type of weather and time of day, altitude,etc. i can say for an absolute fact, and i would affirm with all that i am, that what i saw was not anything that i had seen before or since. i am not willing to say it had little green men, or grays or anything else in it, but i know it was not an identifiable craft, either in design or propulsion. i have often felt that perhaps it was a gov't. craft of some type, because of the 'port' and 'starboard' lights. also, one thing i remember is that our local weekly paper, the \"news herald\" reported that during that same time period there were numerous sightings, and even our local township police, (huron township, michigan)had spotted and followed a craft, and actually went into a ditch following one of these sighted craft. i am at work right now, so i cannot attach a sketch, but if you contact me and provide me with an address, i will mail you one i drew up.i wish i had contacted you years ago, but this event made such an impact on me it was like it happened last week. thank you, harry timothy slomers"],"City":"Taylor","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Watched craft descend very fast, pull up, cross
