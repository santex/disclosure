Cars parked along side of Hwy 46; people looking up. Why? I stopped along side of the road and looked up. There was a flame and then nothing. It had disappeared. There were no vineyards at this time, just scrub brush. There was a whitish color flame? and the ?object was moving straight up and then suddenly disappeared. What was it? I have been wondering all these years...nearly 40. The flame suddenly disappeared. Vandenberg AFB was more than 50 miles to the southwest. I had seen missiles that were shot from there and were headed to the ?south Pacific."],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
