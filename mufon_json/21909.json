Wichita Kansas heading south on Tyler Rd. In center turning lane about to head left on 9th street. Saw what appeared to be the edge of a disc-shaped UFO directly over the intersection of Central & Tyler. It was bright metallic silver, about as wide as the intersection and hovered about as high above the street lights as the street lights were from the ground. She took a second look because she couldn't believe it. It was still there. There were striated clouds all around it. It was stationary. She thought it was a reflection at first but it didn't move when she moved. She made her turn and circled back within 30 seconds. It was gone."],"Date of the Event":"02/16/2010 04:45 UTC","Region":"Kansas","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/16/2010 11:35 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-97.336145","Latitude":"37.700236","Case Number":"21909","Log Number":"US-02162010-0008","Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Wichita","There were no other sightings in Wichita on or around February 16th 2010"]}
