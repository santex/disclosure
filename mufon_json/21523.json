{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/01/1976 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was approximately 7 years old. My bed faced the street. I was awakened by light shining on my face through the window. I saw a lighted object hovering on my street and I could see inside of it. I saw beings inside that looked as if they were covered in black nylon fabric and there were controls inside the ship. I crawled out of my bed and got my mother. She brought me back to my room and looked out the window. She dismissed my claim as a bad dream and tucked me back into the bed. After she left, I felt the light on my face again. I opened my eyes and the object had returned. Once again, I crawled out of the bed and got my mother. The object was gone and my mother didn't see anything outside. She tucked me back in and stayed with me for a few moments, then returned to her bed. It wasn't long when I felt light on my face for a third time and opened my eyes to see the object on the street outside of my window. I crawled out of my bed and got my mother again. When she came into my room, the object had disappeared, but when she pulled back the sheets to put me in the bed, static electricity filled the room. My mother stayed with me after that. The next morning, she asked me to make a drawing and color what I had seen. I couldn't find the colors in my coloring box to match. I did the best I could with Carnation Pink and Cornflower Blue. Years later, I saw the colors that I had seen on the ship. It was neon."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"A UFO with pink & blue neon lighting landed on my streeet.
