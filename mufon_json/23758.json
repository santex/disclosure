There was a beautiful rainbow forming , yet at the same time something was urging me to go on the outside fast . At that point deep inside I just knew the UFO would be there but wasn't sure if I'll see it with my eyes , so I grabbed my camera (just in case) & almost run outside , knocking few things off , lol ! I was mesmerized at the site since the rainbow was even more bigger with more vivid hues . I took a photo & was about to turn & leave (thinking I'll might see it once I put the photo on the computer) , but at that instant I got an urgent feeling to turn around & take a photo at that precise moment . Amazingly , there I saw a white round light so I smiled & snapped the photo :-) I was very elated at that point , it seemed they did indeed wanted me to photograph it . For approximately 13 milli-seconds I saw the white sphere . It was just coming out of the rainbow , at about 45* off the horizon & exactly at a mid-point between East & South direction , obviously above the lake . The 1st photo was taken at 6:22:35 PM & the 2nd photo at 6:22:48 PM that the UFO is visible on the photo attachment . I went inside & looked out my window but the UFO wasn't visible at this point , however the rainbow now was enormous showing 7 different prismatic hues , it was just beautiful . The whole experience actually relates to my dream I had last night and so I'm very pleased & thankful to our G-d . Although I wanted to attach the 3rd photo I took , already at my home through the window , I've decided not to as it would identify the place of my abode . The 2 photos are a close-ups of the event ."],"trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There was one other sighting in Toronto on or around June 14th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"CA-06142010-0018","Summary":"White UFO in a spectacular rainbow over Toronto & the lake.","Longitude":"-79.375434","Region":"Ontario","Case Number":"23758","Country":"Canada","Latitude":"43.660816"}
