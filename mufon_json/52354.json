We live in the country so, it's nothing new.. But, this time, the Deer Cam caught an odd light that we first thought was the moon. However, the light doesn't behave like the moon would in such a short time frame.. Unfortunately, No one was outside during the times the Deer Cam took the pictures so, no one got to see this in person. But, We thought the pics were pretty interesting, though... You can see the pics and give your opinion on what you think they are or could be. Thank you for your time! ^w^"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11212013-0006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52354.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52354.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/21/2013 02:07 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.967293","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
