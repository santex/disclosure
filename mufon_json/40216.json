My husband and I went to the firework show @ Lawton High School. This was a half hour before the firework show began. I don't know what the heck this was. It was in the shape of an oval, with a ring of light spinning around it. On my list of some of the weirdest things I've seen. This time taped! It was closer to us at the begining, then flew further away & disappeared We were both hoping it'd come closer. It didn't, and there wasn't anymore with it or after it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.317434,+-85.595984(40216)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40216) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 11:24 UTC","Longitude":"-85.595984","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Lawton High School","Tags":"City","Latitude":"44.317434","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lawton High School","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 12:00 UTC"}
