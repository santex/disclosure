My husband looked up and noticed an orangeish looking orb and exclaimed, \"Look! A UFO!\" I said, \"Nah, it's just starboard running lights.\" We were standing facing East and the object was moving slowly North. We got into our vehicle and proceeded to drive to the entrance of Interstate 4, which in central Florida is a North-South corridor. As we were driving West to the first exit to the city of Deltona I saw the light again and told my husband, \"Look! It's your UFO again!\" He snorted tiredly. The light was still moving to the North. That was the last time we saw the orb."],"Log Number":"US-01032013-0013","Longitude":"-81.195469","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Florida","City":"Deltona","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"An orangeish fireball-looking orb.","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States"}
