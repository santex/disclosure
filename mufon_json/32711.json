I noticed in my peripheral vision light, when I turned my head I saw a round ball of light right over my head. Then it moved forward & disapeared. It wasn't as large as a basketball but it was bigger then a tennis ball. No sound. My dogs didn't bark they were the same. I was surprised how close it came to me? This is the first time I'v seen anything like this ever. I googled round ball of light & the phoenix green orb story from oct 2nd came up so I clicked on Mufon & wow this is amazing. I still want to know what is it? I was not harmed but why was it so close to me?"],"trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Chandler","There were no other sightings in Chandler on or around October 18th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-10192011-0004","Country":"United States","Case Number":"32711","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32711.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32711.html"],"Region":"Arizona","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/18/2011 08:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
