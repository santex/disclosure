I was in my livingroom and have three large windows to the west, preparing to watch TV. I saw the flaming cylinder and went to the windows and watched as it came up from the south. When it started to turn to the west, I turned my back to it and went to the east of the livingroom where I had my binoculars. I brought them back and put them to my eyes to see if there were portals and visible means of propulsion. Only slightly larger flames at the back, no portals. I was certain it was an unidentifed flying object. I was a member of the MUFON in Morrison, Colorado at the time. I tried to report this sighting on the MUFON network, Colorado, but was unable to do so that night but reported it in the morning of the 12th.
