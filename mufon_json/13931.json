As I was driving aorund downtown, I took a couple of random pics. Later on, I went back to review the pics I had taken and came across this. I did not see any helicopters or planes in the area at the time of my pic, so I though it was just a dot on my lens. But once I zoomed in on it, I relaized it was much more than that! :) I took the pic from my Blackberry curve, it's not the best, but it's a pretty good shot from a camera phone!
