The light from the tower reflected off the disc that was just hovering about a 4 way stop by the local wallmart. I only saw this happen about twice before it vanished. I've never seen anything reflect light like this disc did it was big enough to cast a shadow and from the overpass you could see only an outline. at first i thought maybe i had seen a plane come in and the light was playing tricks on my eyes so i pulled over and got out of my car to see if the light would show it again sure enough there it was. It never moved until the third time around for the light which takes a while 1-2 mins then it just ... vanished no movement nothing. I was really scared granted it was the first time i had ever seen anything like that in the skies."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.380573,+-85.354965(16667)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16667) map </A>","Tags":"City","Case Number":"16667","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Cadillac","There were no other sightings in Cadillac on or around April 21st 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.380573","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
