As I watched these stars I noticed that they were moving in a northerly direction. I pointed these lights out to my wife and she said that she could see three lights, not two and they were in a triangular formation. As I looked harder I could see the third light which was not as bright and was in the lead position. We watched the lights for about 3 or 4 minutes as they slowly drifted toward the north and as they moved they seem to cover stars that were in the path of travel and did not make a sound.It seemed very far away and very large. Then suddenly one by one the lights blinked out and we could not see it anymore."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-97.354256"}
