I have a new gen 3 night scope and my old camcorder at about 8:25 I picked the scope up and the first place I pointed it to look through which was facing north looking North East 80 degrees I seen a formation of dull white circles in formation flying from North to south very fast. The first thing that hit me was this is the same thing I have seen before on a famous you tube video I mean a carbon copy of it. From the time I spotted it, till it was gone was around 20 seconds.
