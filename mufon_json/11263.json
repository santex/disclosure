Strangly enough,what drew my attention to the the object was the feeling of static in the air that raised the hairs on my arms and neck and what could only be described as the feeling of walking through a giant magnetic chamber as to the waves of magnetic resonanance that I felt when the thing first got my attention. The object was like an elongated tear drop shape that didn't alter orin any way and as I stated earlier, it would dart off in one direction then come to a dead stop from a blazing speed with out slowing down and then wouldjust as suddenly change direction some times without even stopping."],"Longitude":"-116.414469","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"38.80914","Summary":"for almost 16 minutes the object hovered and darted at an altitude of about 100 feet until it took of at a right angle from a dead hover to almost light speed and disappeared over the mountains.","Object Shape":"Teardrop","trends":[],"Date of the Event":"04/19/2008 10:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/19/2008 10:45 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.80914,+-116.414469(11263)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11263) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Nevada","Log Number":"US-06222008-0004","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11263.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11263.html"]}
