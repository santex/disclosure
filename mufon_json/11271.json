They were so bright that they illuminated the woods below. Suddenly a ray of light shot out of one of them and struck the other knocking it back slightly. Then they quickly flew off side-by-side in the direction of the radio tower in Newark. I've never seen anything accelerate that fast. From the to the time it took off til it disappeared over the horizon took only about 3 seconds."],"Summary":"2 Large Shining Spheres","Date of the Event":"10/01/1976 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Newark","There were no other sightings in Newark on or around October 1st 1976","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11271.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11271.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"11271","Latitude":"40.06564"}
