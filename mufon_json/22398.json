I noticed a round silvery object and thought it was a Large mylar ballon. Then it dawned on me it was not streight up like a ballon but on it's side. Then I realized it didn't have a tail (like a kite would have) or a string attached. It went slowly straight up and when it got about 30-40 feet,then 2 others poped up and stopped below the first one. We have alot of winds up here and the first one was stable all this time. Of the two, the one on the right took off like a bat out of hell and the one one the left slowly drifted off. Now the first one slowly drifted over Denny's. They all went in 3 differnt directions and 3 different speeds. I didn't say anything to anyone because the dinner was full of old people and I know they wouldn't see anything. I was a caregiver and I know the elderly. And this is not my first sighting but my most recent. Thank you for letting me tell my story. They have been here."],"Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arizona","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22398.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22398.html"],"City":"I was in Prescott,Az","Date of the Event":"03/15/2010 11:50 UTC","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in I was in Prescott,Az","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"3 round shiny silver/red objects poped out of grove of tree's","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.058118,+-111.090321(22398)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22398) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03202010-0006"}
