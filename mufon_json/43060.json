On Oct. 4 at 9:30pm I was outside with the dog and looked up in the sky and saw a UFO. It had a solid white light, a blinking white light and 2 light blue lights on the side. It was traveling from south to north and made a complete 360 degree turn and continued north where I lost sight of it as it went over the horizon and behind some trees. It appeared to be traveling at about 20,000 to 30,000 ft in altitude and at the speed of a satellite and it made no noise. It did not have the standard aviation navigation lights that all airplanes are required to have. I live close to Houston George Bush airport and I see airplanes every night and occasionally helicopters at all altitudes. What I saw was neither. Thanks."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"43060","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-95.41357","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/06/2012 03:04 UTC","Object Features":"None","City":"Spring","Log Number":"US-10062012-0010","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.08119,+-95.41357(43060)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43060) map </A>"}
