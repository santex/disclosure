Pointing WSW about 4:30 pm dusk, 12-24-2009. It was difficult to get the camera to focus because it was so cold outside and that seems to cause problems with the focus on the camera. I didn't actually realize I had caught anything else until I was loading it up on my computer. I didn't think it was normal for a plane to maneuver in front of another plane this way."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"21147","Date of the Event":"12/24/2009 04:30 UTC","Longitude":"-75.878828","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21147.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21147.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"39.340667","Source":"MUFON"}
