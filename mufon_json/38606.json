They were both parallel to each other about 35-40 degrees from the horizon in the North Western sky. They stayed stationary for about 10 minutes and then alternated on one rising and the other lowering below the rooftops. They danced like that for about 35 minutes before both lowering below the rooftops to where I could not see them. They both blinked red, white, green, and blue. Red and blue seeming to be the most used. The one on the left would blink through the colors quickly while the one on the left blinked a little bit slower. After I saw the objects the temperature around me got a lot warmer and I started to sweat. Not too happy about that part of it. I also couldnt get video or photos as I only have a camera phone and it wont pick them up at all... I invite anyone out here to see them on a clear night though!!!!"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"05/29/2012 12:57 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/28/2012 10:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Overland Park","There were no other sightings in Overland Park on or around May 28th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Region":"Kansas","Case Number":"38606","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Overland Park","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.719404","Latitude":"38.924752","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.924752,+-94.719404(38606)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38606) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
