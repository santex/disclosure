( no noise at all & too big) i just had to tell someone , it was a really nice night so someone else had to see it , it`s not the kind of thing you miss. i know it`s friday the 13th and everything , but this is not a joke in any way. i wish i had a camera with me , i can tell you that i will be keeping one in my vehicle for good after what happened tonight. i really don`t want to be identified whatsoever , but it`s important that someone else know what just happened out here. i`m not sure if the airport would have picked anything up on radar , as it was flying really low , again estimate about 5-600 feet. ( used to skydive so the height should be fairly accurate) if you find out anything else , please let me know , i would be extreamly interested if someone else saw this object. thanks for your time"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","Object Shape":"Oval","Date of the Event":"07/13/2012 10:54 UTC"}
