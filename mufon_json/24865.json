{"divs":["Sighting Details I and my wife Patricia Alexander were on the eighteenth floor of Harrah's in S. Tahoe enjoying the view of the lake and we saw what I thought at first might be someone parasailing (approximate size of a pea at arm's length). The object hovered then, so I figured it was a helicopter. Then, several times, it descended to lake level and disappeared, appearing as if it were briefly and repeatedly submerging. Then it would reappear, fly slowly along, hover, descend, and vanish again. Eventually we got tired of waiting for something else to happen and left. If it really was submerging, it could not have been a helicopter, but, conceivably, we were just losing sight of it. If it did not submerge I cannot rule out the possibility that it was a helicopter, but its behavior did not fit search and rescue, sightseeing, or police surveillance. As for water sampling, that is done cheaply and safely with a boat. Helicopters are expensive."],"Latitude":"38.939141","Object Shape":"Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.939141,+-119.982908(24865)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24865) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-119.982908","City":"South Lake Tahoe","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24865.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24865.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/28/2010 06:00 UTC","Case Number":"24865","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Dark object flying and hovering over Lake Tahoe and possibly submerging.","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in South Lake Tahoe","There were no other sightings in South Lake Tahoe on or around July 28th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-07312010-0013","Date Submitted":"07/31/2010 07:13 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
