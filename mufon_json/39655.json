It flew West over Dresden and passed a military jet which was about 2 miles South of the object and several thousand feet higher. The disc was moving about twice as fast as the military jet and continued West towards the horizon. It would have been impossible for anyone looking at the sky in that direction to have missed it as the object was VERY bright, very fast, made no sound and left no contrail."],"Summary":"Bright glowing disc appeared & then flew West over Dresden nuclear power plant & continued West past military plane which was heading East","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"39655","Date of the Event":"06/19/2012 08:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.52355,+-88.200589(39655)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39655) map </A>","Latitude":"41.52355","Log Number":"US-06202012-0027","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/20/2012 11:17 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Shorewood","There were 3 other sightings in Shorewood on or around June 19th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Shorewood","Region":"Illinois","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00"}
