The object was very big and it was high up, at least 10,000 feet and stationary. It faded in and out a few times. I was unable to get it on my video camera, so i stood around a bit then started to walk north on 8th. As i was walking i looked up ( North East ) and noticed what look like an orb shining bright blue, it disappeared and reappeared a few times. The object was flying very fast up and down side to side and circling around, it stopped once and hovered for around 3-5 seconds then took off at a hi rate of speed, it made no sound. As the Orb dimmed i noticed it looked like a disc. The Disc had 2 cylider shaped objects on each side, when it would move the cylinders looked like they were rotating in the direction it was going."]}
