It was a triangular shaped object, a little off in the distance, but it still appeared to be huge in size. It made NO sound whatsoever. None. I've never seen anything like it. The blinking lights (one in front and two bigger ones in back) were incredibly bright, so bright my eyes had to adjust and refocus every time they blinked, and i could follow its progress as it seemed to float away off into the distance for some ten minutes, untill the trees blocked it out. it had no red or green lights that an aircraft would have, just three extremely bright white lights. I was dumbfounded, and tried to grab the binoculars from indide the house but was unable to find them. Again, it was nearly 1 in the morning, and i've never seen anything like it. I was neither tired nor under the influence of alcohol."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11254.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11254.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Date of the Event":"06/21/2008 01:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Tomah","There were no other sightings in Tomah on or around June 21st 2008"],"Tags":"City","City":"Tomah","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.986576","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON"}
