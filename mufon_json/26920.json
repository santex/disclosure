I was with some people who took me there. Next I hear a whistleing sound and a group of lights from the sky. It was fast and it happened that I fainted. I think it was a UFO. I saw that something like a vortex came from the stars and I could see what appeared to be the stars and everything around it like a drop of water bouncing off more water, it looked like a chandelier. I was so amazed. I have always had so much respect for the intergalactic and the planet Mars. And I know so much about these things. I love the Universe and it amazes me this happened to me. I will never forget about the Universe. I saw it come at me and then I forgot. Maybe I fainted for a good reason. Maybe the Universe is not as big as it looks."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"26920","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around January 7th 1997"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"12/09/2010 10:08 UTC","Summary":"This might have been an abduction.","Date of the Event":"01/07/1997 12:00 UTC","Region":"Nevada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26920.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26920.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.122646","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12092010-0016","Longitude":"-115.170176","Sighting Duration":"03:00:27"}
