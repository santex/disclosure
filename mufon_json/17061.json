The kitchen of my house is in a hill, so I can see Brasilia City from above. The sky was clean without clouds. The sun was shinning. Suddenly a bright flash caught my attention. I looked outside and saw a huge, I mean, very huge, cigar shape object. It was gray, a polish gray, shinny. I could estimate the size because the TV tower that is 23 km distant from me and it has 35m high. The object, I calculate, had aprox. 30m long. It was hovering for 10 minutes until in a amazing speed shhot off to the sky! I know that at least 5 more people saw it because I could see those people looking to the sky."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Brasilia","There were no other sightings in Brasilia on or around May 22nd 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17061.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17061.html"],"Case Number":"17061","Date of the Event":"05/22/2009 06:00 UTC","City":"Brasilia","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-14.225974,+-51.91728(17061)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17061) map </A>","Country":"Brazil","Object Shape":"Cigar","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":""}
