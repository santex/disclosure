The sky still had some evening glow so I was trying to look for stars. I spotted what appeared to be a satellite, like a bright star, moving east to west very high in the sky. I was totally surprised to see a satellite so easily, but it was traveling at the normal speed of the many satellites that I have seen before. Suddenly the light turned ninety degrees to the south and sped up to a very high rate of speed before just disappearing. The distance it traveled from first sight to the turn was about one fist width at arms length and after the turn two fist widths moving south. I immediately did the distance measuring after it disappeared. I watched for several minutes more, but it never reappeared."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-117.151105","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.718839,+-117.151105(18111)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18111) map </A>","Case Number":"18111","Latitude":"32.718839","Log Number":"US-07162009-0003","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"San Diego"}
