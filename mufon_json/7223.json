At Exactly 11:46 PM my husband and I both observed an object coming from the south headed northeastern at a fairly reasonable rate of speed much like you would think a plane would fly we both commented that it was higher in the sky than a plane would be but very much visible as it was blinking light in rows .....it seemed to be a cone shape or a triangle as the one light on the bottom would blink and go out then two above it would come on and blink and go out and then the three on the top would come on and blink and go off and it would start with the one light again and proceed to go through the two three one two three, they would bleed together with the brightness of the lights I found myself counting one two three one two three one two three as it blinked its way accross the night sky with no sound."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Windy","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-105.778907","trends":[],"Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"7223","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/15/2007 11:46 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Latitude":"39.554051","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7223.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7223.html"],"Object Shape":"Cone, Triangle, Other","Log Number":"US-06162007-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.554051,+-105.778907(7223)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7223) map </A>"}
