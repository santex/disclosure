The night sky was clear and I noticed lights in the sky that got my attention. At first I thought it was a jet,but it was moving to fast. I watched the lights moving west to east, it then manauvered left then went back to the course it was on. There is no jet that can change course like this object did,it never slowed down. I have watched numerous planes and jets in this same area and it took them alot longer to move than this object, and move as far as this did in the short amount of time it took. I'm a belever now and never was before. I was so exceted that I made my wife come out and see it. She only waatched it for a few seconds. I have never seen anything like it. It finally flew out of my sight. This all took place within a minutes time and then it flew away."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/04/2009 11:04 UTC","Region":"Vermont","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20880.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20880.html"],"Log Number":"US-12052009-0001"}
