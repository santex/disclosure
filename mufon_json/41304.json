That was a night or two when i had seen this black triangle. The object gave off a static feeling that got my attention, than i got the idea to look up and there was something moving 4 miles an hour. It had those pulsating engine light circles underneath it. 6 or so of the orange'ish circles. It was moving toward Lake Michigan. From east to west. I tried getting my neibhors up to get a look, but no one answered their doors. i assume i was going to tell 'em that they just missed the UFO (again), or they were to sleepy to get up. Nothing more happened that night."],"Date Submitted":"07/31/2012 09:48 UTC","Longitude":"-87.833703","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/08/2011 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-07312012-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.342488,+-87.833703(41304)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41304) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Illinois","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41304.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41304.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:02:16","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
