Heading towards the city limits of Bristol, TN. I observed what I believed to be a helicopter traveling across the night sky. It was moving at a decent speed and had a bright light. Catching my attention, I scanned the night sky. Shortly after, I saw three bright lights that appeared to be in a horizontal row. At first I thought they were lights from a radio tower or something. I thought this because they appeared to be stationary and not moving. They didn't flash or anything. Just three bright lights lined up in a horizontal row. As I got closer to the lights; I noticed there was no radio tower under the lights. I wasn't too emotional just curious as to what they were. After I passed them, I pulled over at a gas station. I got out of my car and looked up but they were nowhere to be found."],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/18/2013 12:03 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51624.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51624.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Bristol","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.601856,+-82.180084(51624)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51624) map </A>","Latitude":"36.601856","Longitude":"-82.180084","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Tennessee","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Case Number":"51624","Object Features":"Unknown"}
