{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWife and I sitting at camp fire looking at stars. Wife sees it first and draws my attention to it. Never seen anything like it before. Had no idea what it was. Very large and bright moving slowly N to S. About 30 seconds to it fadding to a red dot and vanishing. No trail. Amazed at seeing something so unidentifiable. I have seen meteors and comets before."],"Date of the Event":"06/22/2012 10:27 UTC","Log Number":"US-06262012-0016","Date Submitted":"06/26/2012 01:27 UTC","Region":"Colorado","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.610362,+-106.322098(39834)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39834) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Salida CO.","Case Number":"39834","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39834.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39834.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-106.322098","Latitude":"38.610362","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"moving at speed of satalite, very large, faded to red dot then vanished.","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Salida CO.","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"None"}
