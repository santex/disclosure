What was so unusual that drew my attention instantly about it was the color of the light. It was reddish dark orange. It pulsated but not in a constant way. Flickering like a campfire in a way. I turned to look and ask my wife \"what is that?\" only to notice her staring at the same thing already. She said it reminded her of a rocket engine glowing dull. To me it seemed like it was lazily coming down at first then leveled off, my wife said thay she thought it was coming down to land or something (like a feather falling). We are near an airport so we are well accustomed to seeing airplanes. both military and commercial, large and small. And this was NOT anything remotely close to those. What made it odd was its bizarre color and how slow it moved silently as it passed overhead (just to the East from directly overhead). I ran back inside and got my binoculars out and for some reason just as I was attempting to locate it in my sight it dimmed in and out, then seemingly vanished. I could not focus in on it for the life of me (which is unusual; for we sky watch regularly so I am proficitent with using them). Even had that 'feeling' come over us (meaning there's something WRONG with this picture type of thing)"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"12/05/2012 12:04 UTC","Date of the Event":"12/03/2012 07:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44327.html"],"Longitude":"-117.224875","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Highland","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.124907","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.124907,+-117.224875(44327)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44327) map </A>"}
