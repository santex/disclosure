Monday the 6th, one of my passengers on my bus run told me they saw the same thing that nite over Rice Lake which is about 40 miles straight east. Unfortunately, I am not techno savvy to get this video online."],"trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Minot","There were no other sightings in Minot on or around July 4th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"17979","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Minot","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
