I continued to watch it to confirm that it might be a plane but there was no blinking lights and it stayed the same brightness. It was flying away from me and there was no sound. It kept heading south towards malibu and the bright light started to slowly dim then turned red and disappeared. A few minutes later I heard the roar of fighter jets flying super low up and down the coast for about 15 minutes. It was exactly the same type I saw about a year ago, pretty cool!"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Port Hueneme","There were no other sightings in Port Hueneme on or around April 1st 2009"],"Latitude":"34.147783","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.147783,+-119.195107(16367)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16367) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/01/2009 08:20 UTC"}
