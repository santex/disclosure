I ran inside to get the video camera. On my return, there were 6 or more orange lights in a triangular pattern. They were only there for a matter of seconds and I got a little bit of video footage. Unfortunately I did not have a tripod set up and was having trouble locating the lights in my view finder. This was a very similar sighting to my report about the orange lights over the George Airbase last month. We estimate the lights were about 1000 feet from the ground over the lower part of the Apple Valley Mountains. Considering we are nearly 20 miles from this area, the footage gives an indication of the size of the craft."],"Summary":"Orange lights in Triangle Shape","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.182336","Object Shape":"Triangle","City":"Apple Valley","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31719.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31719_submitter_file2__UFO1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31719_submitter_file3__UFO2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31719.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/10/2011 05:29 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
