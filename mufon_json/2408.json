Then I noticed a secondobject trialing behind the intitial object and I ran into the bedroom to alertmy wife. We then watched as the the objects glided slowly across the sky about15,000 to 25,000 feet in the air, the second object seemed to be shaped like acurved wing sail. As they moved North, the wing sail past up the first objectand began to be out of sight, the lights seemed to randomly shine red and greenand the first object slowly changed course upward and westward and eventuallymore southerly. We watched until we no longer could see anything at which pointthe object apeared the size of a star in the sky but had movement relative tothe other stars. Eventually it lost any appearace due to distance."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","City":"Santa Monica","Weather Factors":"Windy, Unknown","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Santa Monica","There were no other sightings in Santa Monica on or around July 5th 2003"],"Summary":"LA July 5th 2003 backyard sighting","Case Number":"2408","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/05/2003 09:25 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/05/2003 09:25 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
