{"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"41.703222","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt about 10:06 I looked out of my balcony doors that face west. The night was clear fireworks were going off in the sky the wind was calm. I thought at first it was fireworks but it was the same red light I saw 2 nights ago. It was bright red it didn't move it just hovered high in the sky. An airplane happen to fly below it slowly so I know for sure it wasn't an airplane. It doesn't last very long but it starts getting smaller and smaller then just disappears quickly!! Two nights prior July 2nd 2011 as my friend and I were driving at night we saw the same light and it did the same thing this was around 10 o'clock. It just hovered there and then disappeared this was in Palos Park IL. On July 3rd that same friend called me and said they saw the light again this time over Alsip, IL this was around 8 o'clock."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29972.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29972.html"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/04/2011 10:06 UTC","City":"Chicago Ridge","Region":"Illinois","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-87.77139","Summary":"Red Circular light in the sky","Case Number":"29972","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Chicago Ridge","There were no other sightings in Chicago Ridge on or around July 4th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.703222,+-87.77139(29972)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29972) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-07052011-0024","Date Submitted":"07/05/2011 08:44 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
