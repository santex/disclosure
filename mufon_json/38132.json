They looked like they were about a half a mile or so above the the city of Pittsfield. The sky was clear with stars visable. We watched while driving for about thirty seconds; then pulled over to one of the lake parking lots off of Rt 7, heading south. They danced around each other, similar to two dogs when they meet. They were not doing it too quickly...but they moved as being comondeered intellegently. After stopping, I took out my phone to record a video. Just as I started trying to focus on them, they quickly jutted away in separate directions. There was no sound, no blinking lights, no form, just light. Unfortunetely, we were unable to get a video. If you need further information, please don't hesitate to contact me.
