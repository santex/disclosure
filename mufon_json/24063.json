and van born rd. in wayne county, mi at approximately 11pm. a similar situation was observed near same location on june 22, 2010. as we walked out of our friends house and approached the car, *(name deleted--sgonzalez\\cms) immediately spotted an object with the look of a plane, but we knew that from last weeks encounter that we must carefully observe anything remotely out of the ordinary, due to the light and shape shifting ability of the craft. so, she points out the object with blinking red lights in the western sky. as our car as already facing west, i pulled straight ahead(west) and turned right out of our friends neighborhood. as soon as we moved, the object moved. turning onto beech daly (just north of van born rd) we began to head north. as we moved north, so did the object. we came to a stoplight, the object which appeared only as specks of light continued north and then reversed direction and headed south back toward us. i then turned east into the interconnected network of housing. the object gained a significant amount of speed as we drove through the neighborhood and the passenger *(name deleted--sgonzalez\\cms) could see that it was clearly following us from above. at this point, i was completely speechless and chills were running up and down my spine. the 'following' object then turned into a 'chasing' object as i sped down the road eastbound toward gulley rd. the speed limit in the neighborhood was 25 and i have no clue as to how fast i was going. all i know is i felt the calm following behavior of the object turn into a speed chase as i increased my speed. i must have been going rather fast since *(name deleted--sgonzalez\\cms)was yelling at me to slow down,or else i will get pulled over. i did slow down and we both lost sight of the object. at this point i was rather terrified. i have no problem with being followed by a ufo, but when i am being chased, i will put my guard up everytime. after the object was out of sight i called a friend who was about 2 miles east of us on michigan avenue in dearborn mi. i told him to meet us at the home depot on the corner of michgan ave. and gulley (an equidistant point between us). me and *(name deleted--sgonzalez\\cms) arrived in my car and **(name deleted--sgonzalez\\cms)was there with his friend, ***(name deleted--sgonzalez\\cms). when we arrive at home depot, our group of witnesses jumps from 2-4. as soon as we all arrive at home depot, a bright object which was too large to be a star was spotted by the 4 of us in the western sky. this 'sighting' causes us to all jump int one car and drive towards the object. as we head west on michigan avenue, we all notice the object begin moving again. this time, however, it does not chase. it slowly flies over our vehicle approximately 1000 feet up and we watch it slowly descend beyond some nearby trees. the object began as a solid light, which was reminiscment of a star, and adopts the local airport colors of red, white, and blue. after watching the object descend into the area just beyond a tree line, we begin to approach again. we see nothing. i know from a similar experience in the same area last week that the object will continue to appear from random locations after descending to the ground. so, even though we don't see the object, i know it will return. i decided that we needed a destination point because this game of cat and mouse was surely goin to grow old. so i decide that the 4 of us will head southwest toward my house in belleville. as we make the 20 minute drive there, we all notice multiple objects with varying light sources. sometimes it would appear as a star like object, and at other times as 2 points of light dancing with each other, flickering their red lights at each other in a way i have never seen human technology work. a this point, all 4 of us are seeing moving star like objects and these sets of red lights that will run parallel with us. sometimes all of the lights would seem to be following our car at once, and other times we saw nothing. every time webwouldnlose sight of the objects, we would catch a glimpse of more comingnoutnof nowhere b the difference here is that they were no longer following us, they were approaching us from multiple angles. this process repeated itself about 3 times on the drive to my house ( in belleville\\new boston. the nearer we got to my house, the more intense the light and speed of the craft(s) became. some of the single objects were even seen splitting into 2. about a mile from house: one craft becomes dominant in the sky and is zipping across the sky at amazing speeds. the craft passes us and heads directly to the area surrounding my 10 acre ranch on haggert road in belleville. when we arrive to the darker skies of the country, we see more blinking and star like objects than we could count. several objects scoot along the tree lines of my property, from both the east and the west. obviously, all 4 of us are in complete amazement by this point. the lights sometimes fade but never enough to let it outbid sight. as the 4 of us stand grouped together in my yard, an object of unknown shape is approaching from the west and on a line which runs directly above us. we literally stood straight up as we watched this craft(which made no noise) fly directly over head and above my house. he craft had multiple lights, but had a sharp beam of light shooting out of it's back end. this wasn't a beam me up moment to us, it was more like a stream of light in the sky which looked like a pointing device. the craft was traveling east and the laser light out of the rear was moving all over the place. once this object passed overhead us and continued east, the moon was beginning to show itself at the tree lines. at this point, another craft with extremely bright spotlight style lights approaches my property from the southeast, coming just to the treelines and turning more eastward and heading directly for the rising moon in the eastern sky. this process repeats itself 3-4 times, each time with the bright lighted object coming directly towards us at a low altitude and turning just before the obstruction from the tree lines would disappear. these craft showed up in pairs and triplets, always heading east and turnpoint and directly for the rising moon. the activity of these craft hit a peak just as the moon was above the distant treeline. as the moon left the horizons grasp and headed further into the night sky, all activity faded. for good on this night. i apologize for the incoherence of this report, but i wanted to get it out there before i went to bed for the night. 4 people (including myself) witnessed these events tonight. we have skeptics within our group comin away from this experience as total believers. the awe and wonder created by these objects is incredible. i actually felt like we were in direct communication. they knew what we were doing, and we knew (sort of) what they were going to do but didn't know how or why. the craft(s) original sighting was in dearborn heights mi. these craft followed and chased us through 15 miles of road on the way to my ranch in belleville mi. i have goosebumps as i type this. i'll proofread and make any grammatical corrections to this when i wake up tomorrow. this experience has deeply affected the lives of 4 people. absolutely incredible."],"Latitude":"42.204762","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Belleville","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/01/2010
