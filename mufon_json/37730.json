I ran to fetch a pair of large binoculars but they had vanished! In this same area a few few years prior, above one of the communication towers a similar orb dotted and darted just above this tower. Recently I've noticed that this particular tower has been downgraded. Lights have been removed. Many planes fly over the area, but this was about 11:00am on a bright and sunny day. I asked a couple of people to view right above the tower looking up into the stratosphere as far as possible, and they confirmed the object. Suddenly it vanished!"],"trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around April 21st 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04252012-0006","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Summary":"While standing on the dock of my work place, viewing contrails of a large Military jet, these two objects seemed to follow!","Longitude":"-96.767403","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
