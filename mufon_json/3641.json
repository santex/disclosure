{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was at work at met hospital,windsor, ont.,western campus, around 1 in the morning and i noticed the ufo out the hospital window, 4th floor. i called in 2 other nurses and they witnessed it also, as well as some patients. it seemed to drift slowly above the detroit river and then it stopped for a few minutes and then it slowly hovered away heading towards detroit area. it looked like a typical ufo right from the beginning. it was saucer shaped with a dome on top and a red revolving light underneath. we were all stunned by it and stood watching it for a while. it just slowly drifted away out of sight over time. it was also near the ambassador bridge (very busy international crossing) so there must have been a lot of other people that seen it as well. i would be interested in knowing if any others reported it also."],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-82.989545","Latitude":"42.296106","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","City":"Windsor","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.296106,+-82.989545(3641)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3641) map </A>","Case Number":"3641","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Dome, Other","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Windsor","There were no other sightings in Windsor on or around July 29th 2005"],"Object Shape":"Disc","Log Number":"CA-07312005-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/29/2005 12:00 UTC","Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"a typical flying saucer with a dome and circling red light drifted and hovered over windsor and detroit area.","Date Submitted":"07/29/2005 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3641.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3641.html"],"Region":"Ontario"}
