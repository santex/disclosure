She has a longish walk from parking to her front door. Beautiful semi-clear night and enjoying sky with some whispy high clouds. Noticed an satelite and stopped to enjoy its flight across night sky. Became slightly obscured by high clouds and reappeared in diagonal trajectory. Thought it was optical illustion. Continued to watch and several seconds later it \"darted\" off at 45 degree angel. Thats it. Nothing sectacular but hey unidentified and very unusuall!
