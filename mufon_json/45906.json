At first he thought they were flares. But, they did not descend and they had no trails of smoke. Instead, they ascended in different directions. He came and got me to witness this and I saw what looked like a flock of red lights, at least 20, like a firework but they were ascending and traveled south, pretty much over our house. They made NO SOUND, and had pulsating red lights and eventually as they got more overhead the lights twinkled out. They were moving fairly fast, not just floating. Once the red light went out on one of them, I saw a silhouette in the moonlight of a sphere shape, kinda brown in color. The two of us stood there in disbelief because we could not think of one logical explanation for what we were seeing. We were stunned enough that neither one of us wanted to miss anything so neither one of us grabbed the camera!! We feel pretty stupid about that now. Finally, they all just faded away into the south sky."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45906.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45906.html"],"Country":"United States","Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
