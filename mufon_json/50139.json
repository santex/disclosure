{"divs":["Sighting DetailsFriday night, August 23 at 8 pm I was outside smoking a cigar in La Mirada, California. There were many jets and planes in the night sky, like usual. You can see the jets heading to the LA airport to land coming from many directions. At 8pm, a bright light went directly over me. It came from the north and flew out of sight to the south. There were no collision lights and no sound. The light did seem to pulse, but very different than collision lights seen on the jets and planes. But for the most part, this first event was a solid white light. This event took about 4 minutes. Anyway, this light did not look like any of the dozens of planes seen while standing outside. Then there was a second sighting at 8:20 pm. This bright light also traveled from the north to the south, but passed more to the east from me. This time, the light slowly turned off just after it passed me. Just turned off. nothing. This second event lasted about 2 minutes."],"Longitude":"-118.009299","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"La Mirada","Case Number":"50139","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50139.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50139.html"],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in La Mirada","There were no other sightings in La Mirada on or around August 23rd 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-08252013-0004","Summary":"Bright light with no collision lights directly overhead; then it disappeared.","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Latitude":"33.920476","Date Submitted":"08/25/2013 12:47 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/23/2013 08:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.920476,+-118.009299(50139)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50139) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
