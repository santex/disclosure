My husband and I were outside enjoying watching the night sky. 2. The object simply appeared directly overhead and fell straight downward for some distance and then abruptly stopped. Did not remain hovering, but made a direction change of 90 degrees and headed north, parallel to the earth until we could no longer see it. 3. We did not think it resembled anything we'd ever seen, it behaved as though it was controlled. We couldn't determine what it could be. 4. The object was a star-like (bright white light), round, suddenly appeared from straight up above us, dropped downward for a time, stopped, made a 90 degree direction change and moved north (at moderate speed) away from us, staying constantly lit the entire time it was visible to us. 5. It was cool to see, even though it wasn't especially \"spectacular\" in shape or color. 6. It simply was too far for us to see any longer."],"Latitude":"33.783432","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ohatchee","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/29/2012 09:15 UTC","Region":"Alabama","City":"Ohatchee","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Bright white light appeared, fell straight downward, stopped and turned 90 degrees, parallel to the ground and moved in a straight line toward the horizon.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38665.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38665.html"],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05302012-0007","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"38665"}
