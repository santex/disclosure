I thought it was strange because I have never seen a plane fly over my area, I think my line of sight is out of the take off and flight path of nearby airport. As I was watching this starlike flashing light, which was pretty high up in the sky; all of the sudden I saw a triangle shaped craft (with a white light in the front, a blue light on one side, and a red light on the other) come out from behind the trees. It seemed to be heading in the direction of the starlike flashing light. The starlike flashing light was very small, but it was far away. The triangle shaped craft was close and compared to the starlike one at least 50 times larger. Upon noticing the triangle shaped craft it only took it seconds to be out of my view. It was there and then it was gone. I went to get my camera afterwards just in case it came back but when I turned it on all I got was static and lines."],"Region":"Oregon","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/03/2008 11:39 UTC"}
