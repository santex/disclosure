My husband was nearby and saw the object when it was well past our neighborhood but he could still see it and agree that it was not moving like a plane would. From afar, the lights appeared more erratic. I have been watching the skies closely for about 10 days since having seen the glowing orbs from afar. Every night I have been outside around 10-11pm and have mostly seen star like objects that move, pulsate in color lights (mostly red to blue to white). They have always been very far away and I have not seen anything so close during my recent sky watches as I have tonight. The object came from the NNW and traveled SE. It came into my view after it cleared the neighbors tree. It was at the level of a low plane. The light was very bright and at first I took it as an airplane but it was not so. It appeared to have windows (?) where I saw only white light. I did not see any wings attached. I detected no sound as I watched it pass over the downtown Crossroads Arts District and toward Liberty Memorial. I was excited to see what I believe is a true UFO, at a safe distance. I have been wondering if maybe if they know I am watching them and for a moment I looked down and refused to look at it. I guess I am frightened by them but also fascinated and so I can't help myself with looking. There were 3 tail lights (?)in the rear and the light flashes alternated at a steady pace. There was a low cloud, patchy cloud that it flew into and that was the last time I saw it. My husband watched saw it for about 30 seconds, analyzing it's pattern. Anyhow, after we thought it was gone and all was done...we saw a red light flash that reflected into the clouds that the object entered. We both saw 3 streaks of red light on the clouds. Weird. My husband said that the object was most definatley gone after that."],"Log Number":"US-08092011-0012","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"30759","Latitude":"39.180969","Date Submitted":"08/09/2011 06:49 UTC","Longitude":"-94.559725","Region":"Missouri","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 2 other sightings in Kansas City on or around August 8th 2011"],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Circle, Oval, Teardrop","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.180969,+-94.559725(30759)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30759) map </A>","Object Features":"Window(s)"}
