I saw a light through my window,very bright slowly traversing the sky. There were no other light outside. It was pitch black because the moon was covered by heavy cloud cover. It had just rained about 30 min ago. Very easy to notice a pulsating light in the sky,especially flying very low and very slowly. I went to the window and noticed it had a square shape maybe that of a cross with bright white lights on the ends and a pulsating red light in the center. There was absolutely no sound as it crossed the sky. I continued to watch it for 7 min. until it disappeared in a southerly direction.I felt sort of bothered,frightened unsure if it were going to come back. I stayed awake till sunrise sort of waiting for something to happen. I had a very strong desire to follow it but it was too cold and wet and thought better not. The object gently moved south until out of sight"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cross","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52283.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52283.html"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-74.065251","Summary":"Appeared at 5:09 on Monday ,glowed,pulsated and flew in a direct line very slowly"}
