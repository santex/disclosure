{"Summary":"Bright white star-like moved from stationary to very quick speed","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/18/2011 10:00 UTC","Longitude":"-95.854712","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Oklahoma","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Owasso","Case Number":"29652","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn Owasso, OK I was sitting on the back porch facing East around 10pm CST. I was looking up at the stars and it was very clear. There were many stars which were averagely lit. One of the star-looking lights just began to move from a stationary position to about 2 o'clock at a high rate of speed. While it was moving further away the light just slowly dimmed out. It was definitely going too fast to be a conventional aircraft. This is the first time i've seen anything of a UFO nature. The thing that irked me was that it was definitely there and completely still before it jetted off. I'm wondering if anyone in the Tulsa area witnessed this on Saturday, June 18th, 2011. Sorry but I didn't have anything to film it with and it only lasted about 7 seconds from the time it began moving to the time it faded out into the distance."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-06212011-0001","Latitude":"36.269539","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Owasso","There were no other sightings in Owasso on or around June 18th 2011"],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29652.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29652.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/21/2011 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.269539,+-95.854712(29652)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29652) map </A>"}
