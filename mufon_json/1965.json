I saw a bright, solidglowing globe moving steady but very slowly at treetop level aprox 80 to 100feet from me. I followed this object for nearly 10 miniutes. I rode a bicycle ona dead end street which made a 30 degree turn at the chrest, where the objectturned to follow the road. It crossed a road perpindicular to the street it wasfollowing and slowly moved out of sight. Speed could have been about 2 or 3 mph.It made absolutely no sound at all. I was cuious but not thrilled until about 6or 7 years ago. The Roswell revelation made me rethink my memory"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1965.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1965.html"]}
