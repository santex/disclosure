It was no helicopter because after the noise there were helicopter I believe looking for this object. But for 5 to 10 minutes, it hovered a high pressured-like noise. Very strange. I strongly believe there has been UFO active around this area as I and my father saw couple of objects going by very high in the sky at night on Thursday and on Friday we saw a bright orange glow object. That could be a planet, but looks very close. I hope other have heard or seen something similar.
