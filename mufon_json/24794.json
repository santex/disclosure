There was many stars and my eyes noticed 5 spesific stars, because it seemed like they flashed alot. Sudentlig one apeard from the stars and began moving away. I followed it, and then it turned around and went back. later so did the one that looks like it is a little away from the other 4. This one also came back, but to the position it was in before. Then they began Flashing like they where communikating to eachother. I got my camera. I captured only a few seconds out of 20 minutes. I captured it with my digital photo camera and could not se in the camera, that is why it is so shaky and it was not before I saw it on the computer that I really realized I had it. The whole 20 minutes the other 4 lights didn't move, but it was like they comunicated with the lights. First movie you can se the light. I went out a few nights later to capture the same place, so people could se, that those stars was not there. Stayed out all night to make sure."],"Region":"North Dakota","trends":[""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24794.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24794.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-100.996752","Date Submitted":"07/27/2010 05:52 UTC","Case Number":"24794","Tags":"City","Latitude":"47.553423","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Hoax","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron, Flash, Star-like, Triangle"}
