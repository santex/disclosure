We were leaving the building I saw something in the sky. I noticed it was unusual as it had 3 bright lights on each side of the triangle and a pulsating red light underneath. I had my phone with me and immediately took a picture of the object. It keep slowly floating Southwest as we watch. After viewing the object my father noticed a helicopter flying in the same area as the craft we had observed. When we arrived home I showed my family and after blowing the image up we all agreed that the object was not a normal aircraft. My father is in the Air force and he felt we should report the sighting as he very familiar with aircraft that normally is flown in this area. Please let us know if the picture is not correct because we had trouble fiquring out how to download from the i phone to our computer.
