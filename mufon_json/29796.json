I called my friend who was driving just infront of me and we both slowed down to 45 talking trying to figure out what we both were seeing. There was no sound from it yet it was clearly over a few hundred feet up. It made a sharp turn up and out after it went out of sight past us. The light was bigger then any engine could of created. I beleive it was a ufo, i couldnt get the picture out of my head.
