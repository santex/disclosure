Feb. 4, 2012 rather low in the sky (below where most jets travel and above the treeline)in the north-eastern Oakland County sky an orange rectangular-shaped object slowly moved in a western direction and then stopped. It appeared to hover with the star-like orange light pulsating then died out without the object moving or falling from that position in the sky.
