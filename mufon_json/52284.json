Went right to left first before taking off.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was having a cigarette outside our hotel and looked up at a passing plane heading west. I then saw a disk like object with a redish light very close to the plane which i felt was strange but this was not a helicopter or a plane because it started to head north and went from right to left at a ridiculous speed and then shot at a blink of an eye north west. I called FAA but they told me to contact someone that wasnt in the \"threat department\" but it was a threat because it was flying so close to the plane. I called back but got no where so I really have to report this because it was something that we do not possess for technology that I know of, whatever this thing was... Please get back to me if youve heard similar calls please. ---Ryan"],"Latitude":"36.145862","City":"Nashville","Country":"United States","Case Number":"52284","Longitude":"-86.819137","Log Number":"US-11182013-0010","Sighting Duration":"00:00:35","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.145862,+-86.819137(52284)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52284) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/18/2013 04:24 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/18/2013 02:43 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Tennessee","Object Shape":"Disc","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
