I got onto a main road where the sky was more open and followed the lights. 3 separated themselves from the one on the most left. They hovered and moved very quickly to the right and then disappeared. It was like they vanished in thin air. The sole remaining one hovered directly above as I drove down the road. It flew slightly to the right and then, all of a sudden, it was gone. I drove around for another ten minutes trying to find them again, but to no avail. The total duration of the sighting was around 3 - 4 minutes. Of course, the only time I witness UFO's, nobody is with me to see them also. But, I know what I saw and they were not planes, helicopters, orbs, or meteors. They were orange objects with red lights amidst the exterior which flew and vanished."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52508.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52508.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"4 orange shapes hovering. 3 flew then disappeared. 1 hovered and flew approximately 100 feet then disappeared.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"South Carolina","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Oval","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.987845","Log Number":"US-11292013-0024"}
