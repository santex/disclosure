Did not see it until after I took picture. I hope to kill two birds with one stone here...On Thursday though while staining siding of a house at work in Jackson,TN. I looked toward the sky over my head and saw two fuzzy white balls streak by at amazing speed. The first went by then 10 minutes later another. Clear Sunny day. These objects were about 80 ft to 200ft. in the air. No sound. I did not have camera. Last weekend there was the one at chicasaw state park too. Last in series of photos."]}
