{"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 09:17 UTC","divs":["sighting details1. where were you and what were you doing at the time? we were facing due east watching fireworks from our back yard. 2. what made you first notice the object? we were watching the sky for fireworks when we noticed a glowing object to the south. 3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it? initially, we assumed it was a firework, but quickly realized that it wasn't. it was not an aircraft because it had no flashing lights indicative of an airplane or helicopter. 4. describe the object and its actions and motions. the object was a glowing orange\\amber circular shape. it maintained altitude and traveled on a flat trajectory (south to north) across the horizon. it left no trail (contrail or smoke) and made no sound. it was not a firework, airplane, or helicopter. we have two airports in close proximity and see air traffic regularly. the object remained visible for roughly one minute, until it moved over the north horizon. the cloud cover reported at lambert international airport (25 miles away) was cloudy at 7,000 ft and mostly cloudy at 15,000 ft. the object must have been below 15,000 ft in order to have remained visible. there was just enough time for my wife to grab our digital camera from the kitchen and shoot one picture before we lost sight of it. 5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. we were curious and watched intently because it was clearly not behavior consistent with aircraft or fireworks. we were intrigued because we've never seen anything similar to this before. 6. how did you lose sight of the object? it disappeared from view as it went over the horizon to the north. i've attached the picture that was taken. i used the highlight option in hp imagezone software to lighten it. the object that we saw is in the center of the photo toward the top. it was much more orange\\amber to the naked eye, but the picture makes it appear more white in color. we did not see the orb left of center until we reviewed the picture on our pc. none of the three adults present saw the second orb. we were all focused on the glowing object."],"Summary":"Orange/amber glowing sphere moving south to north.","Longitude":"-90.692948","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"24156","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in O'Fallon","There were no other sightings in O'Fallon on or around July 4th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 01:21 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"O'Fallon","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.814368,+-90.692948(24156)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24156) map </A>","Region":"Missouri","Latitude":"38.814368","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-07052010-0009","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24156.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24156_submitter_file1__4thofJuly025-HighlightOption2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24156.html"]}
