We looked over our back fence and she noticed these two objects, each were slowly changing colors from red to blue to greenish. The objects cycled through their colors over the span of about 2 or 3 seconds. We got the video camera out (I dont know how to attach the file) and video taped them for about 5 minutes. The objects appeared to be over Camp Williams (reserve base). What was so strange was the way that they were manuevering. They would accelerate rapidly and then change direction very quickly. After video taping for 5 minutes, the objects disappeared."],"Case Number":"23546","Longitude":"-111.933772","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"40.528663","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23546.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/30/2010 10:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-05312010-0006","City":"Riverton","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
