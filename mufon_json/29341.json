It came from the south going north west. It was moving fast and flickering. It only lasted about 7-8 seconds and faded out. We waited about a minute and started back in when another one appeared just as bright going on the same path as the first one that appeared and faded away. Both went in the same perfectly straight path. Both times there was no sound. Nobody was out on the street and there are no street lamps on our street. We new right away that it was not a plane as they don't have orange lights and there was no sound and we are not near an airplane approach or flight path."],"Log Number":"US-06012011-0004","City":"Dennis","Case Number":"29341","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29341.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29341.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Summary":"Bright Orange spheres came from south to north west for a short distance","Date Submitted":"06/01/2011 03:58 UTC","Longitude":"-70.190203","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.742696,+-70.190203(29341)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29341) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Massachusetts"}
