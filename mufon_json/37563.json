{"divs":["sighting detailswent out on front porch of house to have cigarette at approx 11:50pm on 4\\17. noticed very bright light through trees directly behind me. my first reaction was that it was a planet (though it did not have the characteristic \"twinkle\") observed object remaining static for around 2 minutes through trees, then repositioned myself in back yard to see object unobstructed. object remained still for several more minutes, then began to track east, very slowly at constant altitude. object again appeared to stop, then track the opposite direction (west). this occurred within the span of roughly 5 minutes. intensity, shape, and color of object appeared to remain constant throughout. at this point, i got in my car to reposition myself once again, following it toward the auburn auction park from leo area. at this point, i could see the object clearly, and it appeared to be moving away from me in a west heading. i continued to follow the object through laotto on highway 205, at this point, it appeared to be north and west of my position on the highway. i maintained intermittent view of the object when trees did not obstruct. i lost sight of the object about 5 miles before reaching churubusco. last sighting was at approximately 12:30am, somewhere on 205 between laotto and churubusco. during road pursuit, flight path of object was difficult to judge, but the object was remarkably brighter, lower, and more \"yellow\\orange\" than other aircraft i had observed in the sky. what struck me about the object was the intensity of the light. it did not flicker, pulse, or display any other observable color than white\\yellow\\orange. i've lived under airports and been near aircraft landing patterns all my life and have never observed anything like this."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"04/18/2012 01:36 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.557546,+-85.599554(37563)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37563) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"bright orange/white orb at tree level in vicinity of Garrett/Laotto area","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Leo, IN (observation poin","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37563.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37563.html"],"Region":"Indiana","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"04/17/2012 11:50 UTC","City":"Leo, IN (observation poin","Longitude":"-85.599554","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04182012-0005","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"37563","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.557546"}
