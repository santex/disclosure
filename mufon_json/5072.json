It was at 10:30 PM July 14, 2006 I had just stop filming two 20min sessions and was downloading the video I had captured and was sitting outside with my neighbor when he stop talking and said he just saw a shooting star go by. No more than 1 mins later I also saw a streaking object come in from the east and go over the roof but it was high and looked like a shooting star. We talked for another 2 mins and I got up and went to look at the sky and to my shock I saw a bright pulsating object to my west and it was moving to the northwest and I screamed look look finally someone else to see these objects I have been seeing. My neighbor ran over and saw the object I told him don't take your eyes off of it and I ran inside the house to get the camcorder and the disk had not been done downloading so I yanked it out and formatted it as quickly as I could, my Wife Pam ran out to look as well and by the time I got out there and got the settings setup it was kind of faint but was still there. I think I filmed it for 15 mins or so and it got farther away and was getting hard to see but it looked like a star for a long time. I thought I saw a few objects at one point but was hard to tell and they were just below and a little west of the big dipper. Someone in Vero Beach or maybe even north of that had to see them. I have not looked at the video yet but this area is active. I have been seeing them for the past 8 weeks now and I wish some other people would come out and watch the skies in the Boca, Delray, and Palm Beach areas to confirm the objects that are appearing here. I'm trying my best to catch them on Digital Video but it���s hard to predict where they will be or show up at. It���s a matter of chance to catch them on camera.
