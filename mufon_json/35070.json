We lost sight of them for a few seconds but once I pulled over, my daughter spotted them again and we watched them for about 30 more seconds before they disappeared. After we lost sight, I noticed numerous planes racing toward that spot, then a few minutes later, a military-type helicopter flying in the general area."],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.555811","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35070.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35070.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
