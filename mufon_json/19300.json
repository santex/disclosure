I saw a bright blue light fall fast then slow down and zigzag as it fell. I saw it for about 7-10 seconds until I couldn't see it anymore because trees were blocking my view. I immediately looked at the time on my car stereo after observing this light and it was 5:37am (EST). It possibly could have been a meteorite, but I don't know if they zigzag and behave like this did. It was easy to tell it was very near, I would say it hit the ground somewhere around the Pamida store or around M-37."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"19300","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.224124,+-85.745244(19300)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19300) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/11/2009 05:37 UTC","Latitude":"43.224124","Date Submitted":"09/13/2009 05:58 UTC","City":"Kent City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19300.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19300.html"],"Tags":"City"}
