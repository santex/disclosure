{"Summary":"Very Bright Light Travelling From NW to SE, Approx. 20-25 sec Duration","Date of the Event":"08/30/2011 08:45 UTC","City":"Pottersville","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was stargazing, on the patio, an exceptionaly clear night. Ibecame aware of a very bright light coming from over my right shoulder from the rear, NW direction. This light was the largest object in the sky,the brightest in the sky, and moving quite quickly towards the SE. It appeared round or disc shaped,it was exceptionaly bright white and completely silent. I watched it move towards the SE until it disappeared behind the tree line. It was not a meteor, the moon, or like anything I have ever seen in the Adirondacks, I don't believe it could have been the Int'l Space Station, the shape was wrong.There was no tail,besides it was much too slow to be a meteor."],"Log Number":"US-08312011-0016","Case Number":"31353","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pottersville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"08/31/2011 01:41 UTC","Region":"New York","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-73.818738","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31353.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31353.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.731221","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.731221,+-73.818738(31353)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31353) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
