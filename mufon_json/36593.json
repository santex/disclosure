(first time i saw them actually move). if you have any mufon people in this area - send one over with a telescope! then we can really see something! there is something happening here and it is almost surreal. i would video this, but our video camera is broke! plus, i don't know how much would actually show up on video - you actually have to look through binoculars or a telescope (we don't have a telescope) to see them more clearly. well, there are more details i could tell you, but that is enough for now. i don't know if i should report this to the police or what, but i thought mufon would be a good place to start. thanks for listening. i just wish you could see this . . . every night! p.s. - as far as the event date, like i said - it's nightly."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36593.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36593.html"],"City":"Perryville","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"03/19/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Perryville","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
