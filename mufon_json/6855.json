{"Summary":"free standing motionless for over two hours. emiting diamond like quality","Object Shape":"Diamond","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6855.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6855.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","divs":["Sighting Detailsmy wife and I where sitting on the steps of or house looking southe west . when we saw a multi colored light in the evening sky. at first we thought it to be a bright twinkling star but as the rest of the night sky went by this little bright light stayed in the same location for over two hours. We where looking through a big leafless maple tree so it was easy to come back and line the object up right where it stayed until we went to bed.I would estimate the UFO was many miles away and not something stuck in the tree to far off to estimate a shape but the lights comming from it where like that of a diamond in the sunlight that would catch your eye. I also beleive when I was around 6,7 years old that I was visited and had a rather nice time being led, floating around the area. I'mnot sure if you want to hear about 40 years ago but it is still vivd if any one would like to listne to that. it was before i had even heard of a UFO.
