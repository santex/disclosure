{"Longitude":"-99.895093","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my bedroom eating breakfast, it was about 7:40 am. My window blinds were drawn. Suddenly a bright flash lit up my room. I've never seen anything like it before. I thought it might have been a reflection off of a car, but I didn't hear a car. (I hear every car that goes by my house because my bedroom is close to the road.) The flash only lasted about half a second. It was bright like sunlight. My window faces north. The light somehow filled every corner of my room and shone straight in. I have no idea what this could have been."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.973699,+-99.895093(10263)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10263) map </A>","Case Number":"10263","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04112008-0008","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Hoax","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"I saw a bright flash of light.","trends":["there have been 18 other sightings in cms\\tg n\\a","there were no other sightings in cms\\tg n\\a on or around april 11th 2008"],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10263.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10263.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10263.html"],"Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"cms/tg n/a","Latitude":"31.973699","Date of the Event":"04/11/2008 07:40 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/11/2008 07:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
