Was taking lots of pictures out the plane window. Took several photos of Mt. Rainier to make sure one would be good. Got home to Sacramento that evening and next day downloaded the photos. Noticed the object was in the photo but not in the next shot 10 seconds later. Thought you might want to look at it. Zooming in on the photo it did not appear to be a plane . Photo's included. DSCN 1314 is the first shot with the object in it. DSCN 1315 is the second shot and the object is gone. The time on the photo said PM, but it was really AM. I guess the camera was set wrong."],"Country":"United States","City":"Washington","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Washington","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Washington","There was one other sighting in Washington on or around July 25th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-08142013-0020","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/25/2013 11:17 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Date Submitted":"08/14/2013 12:41 UTC","Summary":"Taking photos of Mt.
