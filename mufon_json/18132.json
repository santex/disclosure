A shop in Sedona, the last one in Uptown. I was standing near the door which was open. I saw something running, I stepped out the door and by then it was too far down the road to have been a human running on foot. It was as fast as I could turn my head. It ran to the edge of the motel parking area and stopped at the bushes. It stopped and looked back at me. It was brown, wearing brown clothing, all the same color skin and clothes, form fitting, large dark eyes but normal looking head and limbs except extremely thin. too thin to have been a human - at least one that could run that fast. I knew it knew I saw it, that is why it looked back exactly at me. I broke eye contact and went back inside. If there is another site to report this on please let me know. I just thought someone should know about it. I am totally freaked out by this and it came to me that I could know where it came from - the tunnel in Clarkdale - but I have no idea why I might think that. I also think it escaped."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07172009-0004","Case Number":"18132","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/10/2009 10:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.87671","Longitude":"-111.75519","Region":"Arizona","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Sedona","There were 2 other sightings in Sedona on or around July 10th 2009"],"Date of the Event":"07/10/2009 10:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.87671,+-111.75519(18132)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18132) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"I saw an alien i think","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
