I see some odd shapes in the sky so I get my digital camera. Not sure what is seen in my camera pictures so I am sending to you all. I have 8 pictures total...what are they? The odd thing is in the first pic 1727 there is small light (actually a couple small lights) to the left of the main light object, then in the 1730 picture the streaking light is aimed right at the main light. Then in the final 1734 picture the small light that was once at left of main light is all of a sudden at the right of the main light, and the streaking light is seen smaller right below the main object. Is this anything?"],"Sighting Duration":"05:51:28","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/16/2009 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[""],"Date Submitted":"11/28/2009 11:07 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20783.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20783_submitter_file1__DSC01727.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20783_submitter_file2__DSC01730.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20783_submitter_file3__DSC01734.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20783.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Colorado","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Longitude":"-105.777007","Log Number":"US-11282009-0018","Latitude":"39.554201","City":"Undisclosed"}
