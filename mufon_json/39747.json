I noticed three bright flashes within five minutes. These night flashes lasted approximately 5-7 seconds each. During the second flash,I woke my girlfriend who was sleeping next to me and she to observed the brilliant blue light in the sky. After the third bright flash I stared getting tweets from my friends in the Bellflower, CA neighborhood who were up and in awe at the night sky. I looked in the Press Telegram the following day and did not see anything about a meteor or a downed powerline in the area. I also don't believe a downed powerline would light up the city of Bellflower."],"Latitude":"33.87734","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.87734,+-118.112117(39747)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39747) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
