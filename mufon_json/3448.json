I was outside practicing baskbetball and when I saw it, I told my mom to come out and see it, but when she got there, they were gone. I thought it was nothing until my friend, Jarred, called and was completely freaking out and he said he d seen it too. Jarred reads books about UFOs all the time and said that these were like something out of the books so I Googled a UFO reporting site and you know the rest. The crafts seemed to make a sound that I could only hear outside of the house, too. It was very low pitched and almost sounded like \"Loooo\"."],"Longitude":"-82.993335","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.292676,+-82.993335(3448)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3448) map </A>","Tags":"City","Log Number":"","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ontario","City":"Windsor","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"Canada","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"3448","Latitude":"42.292676","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Windsor","There were no other sightings in Windsor on or around March 20th 2005"],"Summary":"Not Provided","Date of the Event":"03/20/2005 01:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3448.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3448.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
