As I was looking at the contrail another plane, not a comercial jet, flew very fast above the first trail. I then ran inside and grabbed my cell phone and snapped 3 pictures. I have seen these trails in the sky many times around this area. The pictures were taken about 30 miles south of MacDill AFB in Tampa which seems to be the area the trails come from."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Bradenton","There were no other sightings in Bradenton on or around October 17th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
