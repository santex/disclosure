{"Country":"Canada","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband Bob and I were sitting in the front yard, talking. We didnt have anylight in the yard, only the street light and the kitchen light.As I looked up, i saw a moving light crossing the sky very fast in a straightline going East. I showed it to my husband. It was brighter than a star about4 times brighter than a star. it took that light about 2 minutes to cross fromone side of the horizon to the other. We have mountains on both sides.We couldnthear any sound and there was no trail to that light. My husband said that thatobject must have been traveling out of Earths athmosphere. I am very curious toknow if anybody else saw this phenomena.I believe in Flying objects, being earth made or made by others. It was too highto come to any conclusion....I found it interesting and exciting and would liketo know more....I hope this info will be useful to you."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/02/2003 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.293732","Region":"British Columbia","Summary":"Saw silvery light traveling West to East very fast","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.492731,+-117.293732(2476)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2476) map </A>","Latitude":"49.492731","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2476.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2476.html"],"Case Number":"2476","City":"Nelson","Log Number":"","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date Submitted":"08/02/2003 09:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Windy","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Nelson","There were no other sightings in Nelson on or around August 2nd 2003"]}
