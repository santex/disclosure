I am a pilot and there is no way that airplanes can move like these. They dart, zig-azg and change colors. It often looks like they are \"docking\" on larger craft. The sighting took place in my back yard, looking west. Many other people around here are seeing them too, Littleton, Franconia, and even in Gorham, about 40 miles away. People of all ages and backgrounds. My wife saw them too and she has never seen a UFO.
