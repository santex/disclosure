It was mostly sunny with a a few clouds, when I saw a shiny object moving at a rate of speed no plane could match. It was at about 19 to 20 thousand feet.? It was high enough that I couldn't make out a distinct shape. Closest I could come is saucer shape or something like it. . I thought it was a plane at first. BUT I have never seen any plane travel at that kind of speed and have never seen any plane reflect that much light off of it. This object went into a small cloud and didn't pass through. I should have been able to see him come out, which would have took less than a second as fast as it was going. Not sure what I saw, but I don't think it was any kind of plane"],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Southlake","There were no other sightings in Southlake on or around May 11th 2013"],"City":"Southlake","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Log Number":"US-05122013-0016","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.92418,+-97.203147(47368)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47368) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"I observed a bright shiny object moving at extremely high rate of speed, that disappeared into a cloud.","Date of the Event":"05/11/2013 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"47368"}
