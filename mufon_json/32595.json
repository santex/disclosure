Two beers in; that is all. A flight of three UFOs enter my vision, while gazing at the stars. I engage two other observers. The luminosity of the UFOs is roughly that of the brightest star. One moves in a direct path while the other two loop and twine around each other in strange and unnatural ways, adjacent to the path of the first. They speed off faster than an airplane. An hour later roughly 25 dimmer objects appear in the sky. They fly in a V formation. They move at a moderate speed past the edge of the roof. Myself and others rush to the front of the house where we see the formation halt, form into a square, hold in position for roughly 5 seconds, then speed of west, following the path of the previous sighting. We obtain a camera at this point and wait for a future sighting, however, nothing is observed for the remainder of the night."],"Date of the Event":"10/14/2011 09:23 UTC","City":"Olathe","Date Submitted":"10/15/2011 02:32 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Olathe","There were no other sightings in Olathe on or around October 14th 2011"],"Region":"Kansas","Summary":"1 flight of 3 flying unnaturally, 1 flight of 25+ forming strange shapes.
