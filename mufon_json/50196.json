When you get o.o2 into this report as mentioned above, you should be viewing a Hill Side Fire, a whirled wind very large and just to the left of this you should also be able to be viewing a much smaller whirlwind. This is what first peaked my interest as it seemed very uneasily and unnatural movement. So if you will rewind this to just before this hill side fire is shown, and start your slow motion viewing, pay very close attention from left to right, you should be able to view two orbs traveling in the direction I had stated. Bur more importantly scrutinize all the Area very closely and you should, as I did many time to make sure I was seeing what I was very much seeing. I f you have any ?s. at all please notify me.
