Saw about 20 orange, translucent spheres through trees. Pulled off the road. There were 4 other cars pulled of the road watching as well. The spheres were moving in random patterns. Then one by one they aligned in single file and moved up into the air. They seemed to each vanish one after the other into the same spot in the air. It was a clear night, with a few clouds. The spheres went into the low clouds, again, in single file, one at a time and vanished. There was virtually no sound. The spheres were like \"bubbles\" that were Orange on the outside with a darker red center.
