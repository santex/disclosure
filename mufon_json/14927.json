I was driving on the highway trying to get a good view of this but was hard since I was on the highway. This thing whatever it was, was huge ..the formation it was in was at least a mile across. I knew right away this wasn't a plane this thing had 3 lights on the front and the lights were so far spaced apart that theres no way it could've been a conventional aircraft. I do live near an airforce base and I see the C-130's flying in all the time but their light formation on the C-130's is much different. I knew it was something other than a C-130. The amount of sky it took up was just amazing. This object was huge. Eventually lost sight of it when I drove further down the highway."],"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.451476,+-99.723984(14927)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14927) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"32.451476","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There were no other sightings in Abilene on or around January 14th 2009"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-99.723984","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14927.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14927.html"],"Tags":"City","City":"Abilene"}
