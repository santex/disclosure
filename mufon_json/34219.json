(central standard time). estimated time watching these lights, about 6 minutes. the pulsating never varied, always the red for one second, then the white for a second, and these were exactly equal in time pulsing, then nothing, black. then back again, and always the same very wide distance apart, a bit on an angle. at times we thought it was one craft, and other times we thought they could be two. it looked like the aircraft banked at one moment before we lost sight of it behind the trees. when we came to the other side of the stand of trees, the lights were very faint and far away. it seemed in no great hurry, and was headed in the direction of oshkosh\\appleton, over lake winnebago. we were not scared or concerned, just amazed at these pulsating lights. my daughter and i haven't spoken of it since. if it was a very large aircraft, i would be happy to know it. as it is, i'm not sure what we saw but it was definitely something unusual. this is the third report i'm filing with mufon in the past 2 1\\2 years. we're seeing some interesting things in this area."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"34219","Country":"United States","City":"Lamartine","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Flash, Unknown","Region":"Wisconsin","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.733813,+-88.550594(34219)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34219) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/20/2011 01:49 UTC","Date of the Event":"12/16/2011 06:13 UTC"}
