We thought it was a flare at first, but it kept traveling. Two more of these floating orange orbs came out behind the first orb. We were all in awe over what we had just seen and knew it was a once in a lifetime oppurtunity to see it. They slowly flickered, looking like they were going behind a cloud, but there were no clouds in the sky, finally disappearing. We carried on with the previous conversation. Then, i see something out of the corner of my eye, and it is two more floating orbs the same exact color! they all went in the same line over mine and my neighbors house. Slowly they started looking like they were going behind clouds, but THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY. Finally they all disappeared. We waited for another twenty minutes outside, but never saw another one. It was crazy what we all saw, knowing that we never may see it again."],"Case Number":"50994","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Whiteland","Longitude":"-86.069878","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/22/2013 11:36 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"Bright Orange Light flying in straight path over my neighborhood","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.557218,+-86.069878(50994)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50994) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09222013-0025","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50994.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50994.html"],"Latitude":"39.557218","Region":"Indiana"}
