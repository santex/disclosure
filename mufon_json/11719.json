This was just north of the scenic highway 212 several miles east of a Montana town. A mailed in report came from a Mr. Dolese from his Wyoming vacation apparently. Mr. Dolese said he was from Alaska. My supervisor forwarded it to me and I told him about its contents afterwards. Dolese said he saw an object of unknown type very near the firetower. He said it was in the early morning hours and wondered what it was. He said he thought that I, as a trained observer, would know. I did not see it or know of it. I responded to Mr. Dolese's letter to this. I thought that would be the end of it, and that he would have his laugh. He wrote back, to his credit and my surprise, insisting that he had seen this... thing. It was different enough to have disturbed him I guess. My supervisor took note of it, also finding it of some interest, but noted little else if I recall correctly. He gave no indication that it was something that had happened before. I do not know what it could have been, but it did not wake me, and therefore I suggest it must have been quiet indeed. I still think of this on occasion all these years later, but have no furthur information from the incident. I have never seen a UFO to my knowledge to this day. But I do think that this man did believe that he saw something strange at that time and I feel it justifies a report even now.
