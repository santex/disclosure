It was a wet night and thought water was on the lenses of the camera because there was a round orb in front of the camera, when the camera took another picture 15 minutes later the orb was closer! I captured that picture and 15 minutes later captured another picture and the orb was getting further away from the camera! It wasn't until I started looking at the picture I noticed two beings inside! You can clearly see one's shape of the head and his black eyes you have too look carefully at the picture to see it. I've tried to send it before but couldn't, I hope it comes through."],"Date of the Event":"02/07/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Two Aliens in Sphere","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08282009-0013","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-112.069507","Case Number":"18932"}
