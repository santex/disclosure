Just before the firework show started (approximately 10pm), I noticed two orange, star-like objects in the southern sky. Their intensity slowly varied between dim to moderately bright throughout their flight path. In their \"bright\" stages, they were clearly brighter than any of the few visible stars in the sky. Both ojects were travelling slowly across the sky from west to east. Their trajectory appeared fairly linear. After about a minute, one of the objects changed trajectory and drifted away (southward) from the other. After a few minutes, both ojects began to fade. A minute after that, they were no longer visible. Nobody else in the large crowd seemed to notice. I can't discount weather balloons do to their appearance of drifting, their altitude, and their flight direction. However, they appeared to move faster than what an object blown in the wind would do, and something seemed unnatural about their movement. It wasn't a blatent ufo sighting, but unusual enough to report."],"Log Number":"US-08072010-0001","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/07/2010 12:39 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Boise","Latitude":"43.621001","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
