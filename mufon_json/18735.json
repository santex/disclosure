{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsThree of us were sitting on the porch talking and enjoying the Perseid showers when we noticed over the course of an hour three separate objects fly from the north to the south that seemed like a satellite at first but then would flash rythmically and become extremely bright. I would estimate as bright as a candlelight at arm's length. One by one they went over us. I tried to dismiss them as satellites or high flying aircraft but I have never seen the intensity of illumination or rhythmic patterns they possessed. They also moved slowly and even seemed to stop at times while pulsating. I was truly dumbfounded."],"Date of the Event":"08/13/2009 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/13/2009 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"18735","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.447957,+-123.319982(18735)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18735) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Three flashing objects went from north to south","Region":"Oregon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18735.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18735.html"],"City":"Grants Pass","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Log Number":"US-08182009-0014","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Grants Pass","There were no other sightings in Grants Pass on or around August 13th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-123.319982","Latitude":"42.447957"}
