(i was well trained at that time in identifying both allied and enemy aircraft.) i sat completely still as the object slowly flew away, afraid that if anyone inside spotted me witnessing this, they might come by for a closer look. since i was holding a weapon, i thought something terrible might happen to me. i followed the ship with my eyes, turning my head only enough to keep it in sight until i was looking over my right shoulder and the ship had disappeared over the trees. it was the most terrifying experience of my life. when it was over, i was still alone in the woods, about 1\\2 mile from the next guard, private richards. we did have the field phone though. i waited over ten excruciating minutes for 11:30 to arrive. when it did, i picked up the phone and said, \"you there?\" a voice answered, \"ya.\" \"did you see that?\" \"dude! i'm so glad you said that!\" we both described the same event to each other and agreed it was indeed a ufo. we talked for several minutes until we were both comfortable that everything was cool. if need be, we could always ring everyone on the field phone line. when we got picked up at 1:00am, we both told everyone in our transport truck about the event. naturally, nobody believed us and everyone made jokes about it. the next day, richards denied the entire event out of fear of further ridicule. a few people believed me, but i too played it down and stopped talking about it because i was losing credibility. if richards had held to his claim i would have also. but i couldn���t do it with him denying it. but i do know what i saw. and so does richards."],"Tags":"City"}
