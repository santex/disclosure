{"Longitude":"-75.243785","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in the parking lot of Target and out of the corner of my eye across the tops of some trees I saw all there bright lights. I looked closer and there were 7 lights around a triangle shaped flying object. This was not my first time seeing something like this, but I was so surprised! It started to bank away from me and thats the point at which I could see the formation of lights on the bottom of it. This aircraft looked very big. It was about 3 times the size of a stealth bomber. And the lights were totally different than those of a stealth bomber At first sighting, I though this was just an ordinary aircraft. But upon further examination, it was clear that this was not an ordinary aircraft. I finally lost sight of the object when it got behind the tree line"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Montgomeryville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-09172010-0010","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.247329,+-75.243785(25483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25483) map </A>","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Summary":"7 white lights forming a triangle under a triangle shaped UFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25483.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Other","Date Submitted":"09/17/2010 09:05 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"40.247329","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/17/2010 08:46 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"25483","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Montgomeryville"}
