I was heading due east on I-80 at eastfork road and I could see what looked like a very large vapor trail descending back to earth. It had a tear drop shape with a black center extending up half way thru the vapor trail. It appeared to be above the thunder head cloud that was approximately 20,000-30000 feet high and the object descended behind the thunder head. I can't be totally sure about it's dimensions but the size and altitude of the object would have made it larger than most airliners that I have observed in similar altitudes. It's speed was slower and more of a free fall maybe terminal velocity descent. I believe the thing that stood out most was it's relative size. It appeared to be a very large object. I lost sight of the object as it dissappeared behind the thunder head clouds. You can contact me by email and I will be willing to give further info face to face if need be."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/23/2009 03:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.970579,+-99.897103(16220)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16220) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"16220","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16220.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16220.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03242009-0015","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","City":"Undisclosed"}
