I have had close to 40 sightings of individual ufos in my life from zig zagging stars to Green fluorecent Orbs, Burning orange balls, cloaked things in the sky and the list goes on. I am beggining to think that i'm being contacted because i barely know anyone who has seen one unless they have been with me. to see this many is just unheard of. i have a picture of a burning orange ball too."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"153.023449","City":"Brisbane","Date Submitted":"04/23/2013 04:06 UTC"}
