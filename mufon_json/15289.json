{"divs":["sighting detailsfor many years i've wanted to express my observation of an incident that i've never come to grips with. i'm now 65 years old. the incident occured, i believe the summer of 1966, four miles south of petersburg, north dakota. late one evening in the middle of the summer about 1:00 a.m. three of us guys were driving south of petersburg. as we crested a hill about a mile from my friends home, we seen what appeared to be a flashing red light. our concern was that there may be fire responders at my friends place. after a moment or two we realized that the red light was in fact pulsating-- not flashing. we accelerated to reach the light which appeared to be in the middle of the road. as we approached the light (within 1\\4 mile) it disappeared and reappeared one mile east on highway #32. we continued south to the section line and headed east to observe the pulsating light. again within 1\\4 mile it disappeared and reappeared approximately one mile south on highway 32 and continued to pulsate. we realized then that we would never catch it and if we did, what then. the pulsating light disappeared and reappeared at 90 degree angles ( 1 mile increments ) in the snape of a finger. no sound was hear. why did the pulsating light reappear for us? was it decoying us away, like a killdeer bird from her nest? were these multiple units or just one? i believe it was one unit of unknown origin. my first thought about the incident had to be related to being within 40 miles of the grand forks air force base. we were also only 2 miles to the closest minuteman missile. another site was about 4 miles and the third about 8 miles. my friend told me that after this incident that he and his family seen pulsating lights the following nights appear just south of the buildings. these sightings have been on our minds for over 40 plus years. what did we see? why didn't we communicate the sightings to authorities? i never said anything to other people, i think because i was in the rotc program at the university of north dakota and did not want to jeapordize my future with the air force. we have many questions and no answeres. we do know that we seen something unexplainable."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/30/1966 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Petersburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Petersburg","Longitude":"-98.001488","Summary":"Pulsating red light.","Region":"North Dakota","Latitude":"48.011105","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02032009-0012","Case Number":"15289","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15289.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15289.html"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.011105,+-98.001488(15289)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15289) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/30/1966 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
