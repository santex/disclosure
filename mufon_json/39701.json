The first video is also here from a sighting on June 5, 2012. Because I had seen this twice before (and in the same part of the sky), I set my camcorder on a tripod, placed it on the porch pointing in the same direction, and turned it on. On Friday, June 15, 2012, I captured the object again, and this time from the very beginning until it faded away, as usual. However, it does not first exhibit the line of lights as I had seen before, but just the orb itself. Near the end of this video, some lines are noticeable going into the object from the left and right side near the bottom. I will continue setting up the camcorder to capture another video."],"Region":"Arizona","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"33.294055","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Chandler","There were no other sightings in Chandler on or around June 15th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 2 times.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Second video of glowing orb over Chandler, Arizona","Sighting Duration":"00:01:45","City":"Chandler","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.294055,+-111.865247(39701)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39701) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/21/2012 11:26 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06212012-0034","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown"}
