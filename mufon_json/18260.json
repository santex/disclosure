There were other stars also visible but they were just steady points of light which made me think that this 'flasher' was something out of the ordinary. It appeared to be about the size of a half dollar and was quite bright. I thought it must be about as distant as Lake Comanche (about 10-12 miles from my house). Just another ho-hum light in the sky, I guess, but now I wish I had watched for a longer time."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18260.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18260.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/23/2009 01:30 UTC","Case Number":"18260","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-07232009-0017","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.17191,+-121.146485(18260)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18260) map </A>","Longitude":"-121.146485","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Lockeford","There were no other sightings in Lockeford on or around July 23rd 2009"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"flashing star-like object in the north east.","City":"Lockeford","Latitude":"38.17191","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
