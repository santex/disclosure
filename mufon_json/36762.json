It was just flying across the sky silently at a steady slow pace and disappeared behind some trees in a distance. I waited for it to reappear but failed to locate it after losing it behind the trees. I could see clearly it wasn't a garbage bag or a balloon for sure. Immediately I took out my camera phone to record it but I was a bit shaky from excitement nevertheless still managed to capture it on my Nokia C6-01 8mp."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"3.509247","Summary":"Kuala Lumpur Malaysia, what appear's to the naked eye to be an unidentified flying object shaped like a humanoid with 2 antenna like probes on the sides and the bottom, streaming silently at slow speed across the sky and disappears behind the trees!","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:01:18","Longitude":"101.524806","Country":"Malaysia","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s)","Date of the Event":"03/20/2012 07:28 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/26/2012 09:02 UTC"}
