I was at the sink looking out the window when all of a sudden i saw this really bright light shoot up into the sky. For a second i almost thought someone was shooting up fireworks and i expected it to explode but it just disappeared into the sky. I know that it definitely not a comet, I've seen comets before and this light definitely appeared to have taken off from earth into the sky, plus the light was way too bright to have been a comet. Also as it descended into the sky it flashed for a second, its hard to describe like it slightly lost its light then it got really bright and then disappeared into the sky. I was very shocked by it and i ran into the other room where my sister was and told her about it. She told me that it was probably a comet or something but i know that it wasn't one."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Braintree","There were no other sightings in Braintree on or around June 22nd 2013"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.207902,+-71.004001(48333)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48333) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/22/2013 04:03 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"48333","Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Braintree","Date of the Event":"06/22/2013 03:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-06222013-0018","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.207902"}
