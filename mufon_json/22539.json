Clear sky. My father was walking in the street (in Rome)and adverted my mother by phone of a strange event in the sky. Some minutes after, my mother my brother and I were looking toward the sky (in direction North North-West) in the balcony at first floor of our flat. We everybody have seen what we never saw before: some spheres, emitting light of red colour with nuances orange. I saw only 2 spheres, but my father who was the first to see the event talked about 7 spheres at least. So the entire phenomena could be dured several minutes. The strange spheres seemed to be enough far from us, perhaps one Kilometer or more, (the sky was very clear), so their dimension was very small from our point of view, but clearly distinguishable from any other known flying object. Another thing appear very strange: despite the distance the lights were no flashing or blinking but were fixed. These spheres had a slow ascendent movement and at last vanished in the blu deep of the sky."]}
