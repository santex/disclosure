The first thing that came to my mind is that planes do not fly that close together or that low. I thought it was military crafts at first because they were moving rather fast. I walked around my building and when I started to look more closly at the objects, I noticed the leading craft was no plane. The craft in the back was a plane because I saw the blinking lights that planes have on them. The craft in front was moving slightly faster. There were 3 lights I could see on it all in a row. As if there were a light on the center and each wing, none on a tail. It was odd as I watched when the craft made a fast sharp turn. I soon lost sight of it. The craziest part of this experience was that my friend who I saw minute after this recieved a call from his girlfriend who called him to say she seeing a UFO being followed. She was driving down interstate 283."],"Log Number":"US-02182009-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.044876","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.044876,+-76.299394(15566)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15566) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Lancaster","There were no other sightings in Lancaster on or around February 17th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Date Submitted":"02/17/2009 09:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15566.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15566.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15566"}
