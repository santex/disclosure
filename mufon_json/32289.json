But it was to early to in the day and i don't believe there are any visible this time of year until dusk. It would remain stationary for 10 minutes as I was speaking on the phone and describing it to my parents. Eventually it began a moving in a stair-like pattern to the west slowly at first then increased in speed as it headed for the horizon. I was obviously confused because of the objects stationary position in the sky and then I have never witnessed a vehicle move this way in the sky. i lost sight of it over trees to the west very close to the horizon."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32289.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32289.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.513658,+-97.816769(32289)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32289) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"witnessed a stationary object for about 10 minutes then it began moving in a stair-like patern towards the west. then it was out of site.","City":"Cedar Park","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
