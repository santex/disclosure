She called for me to join her and I also witnessed the object as it slowly moved - not up or down - but towards the east. She went in to get our camera and I witnessed the object \"rotate\" as the 3 lights stayed uniform and the \"front\" light was now towards the top. She returned with the camera just as the lights seemed to almost \"break\" formation and then they moved slowly and disappeared."],"Summary":"triangular shaped object with 3 lights moving slowly eastbound - rotated and disappeared","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
