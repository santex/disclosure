Several hrs later, while editing the images, I noticed two metallic, oddly shaped objects hovering in the sky above the ocean, west of Yachats, Oregon. For lack of a better comparison, both objects resembled metallic hot dogs, with a bright light emanating from the center of both objects. I'm curious as to what you think these objects are? btw, I've talked with one person in Yachats who claims to have witnessed a \"huge\" ufo moving westward along the Yachats River valley."],"Object Features":"Other","Region":"Oregon"}
