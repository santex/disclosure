{"Longitude":"-121.169668","Region":"California","Object Features":"Dome","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Oval","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Saw a spinning dark object moving quickly across the sky","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe sun was beginning to go down and I was outside with my cousins taking videos of various things like cars passing by and each other, when one of my cousins noticed a dark spinning object moving quickly from southwest to northeast. One of my other cousins had the video camera and started to take the video. Before we started recording the object was spinning, but stopped right about the time he started filming. There was no sound, and we did not see any clouds, planes, or other objects in the sky at this time. One of my cousins thought it might be a balloon, but me and my other cousin did not think it was a balloon. It was a warm day and there was no wind, so if it was a balloon I don't think it would be moving that fast and straight. We watched the object until it disappeared over the tree line."],"City":"Folsom","Date of the Event":"07/07/2012 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-07142012-0016","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.682089,+-121.169668(40794)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40794) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"40794","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40794.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40794.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.682089","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/14/2012 04:49 UTC","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Folsom","There were no other sightings in Folsom on or around July 7th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON"}
