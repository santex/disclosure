My mom said she watched it for at least a half an hour before she fell asleep. My father said he watched it for about 15 minutes before he went and got my mother. I don���t know how much longer he was outside after my mom fell asleep. (She could see it from the window in their travel trailer.) The object, as I mentioned, was round. It changed colors from red, white, blue and green. Mom said it moved up and down and a little from side to side. Sometimes it moved slowly, sometimes quickly. They think it COULD be something military as earlier in the day they had two military cargo planes fly LOW overhead going in that general direction. My mom said the planes were low enough that she could easily see the pilots in both planes. There were other aircraft in the area as the land my parents own is in the flight path for final approach into ABQ. This is all of the information I have. If you need anything further please feel free to contact me. (Their cell phone doesn���t work up where they���re at but I can have them contact you when they go into town.)"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Region":"New Mexico","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-108.498703","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12348.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12348.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Quemado","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
