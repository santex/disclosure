{"divs":["sighting detailsfour ufo's seen in night sky on june 29th at 12:40am. no spotlight, no trace light coming from the ground. all four did not have a color. looked to appear to be white in hue. four sphere\\circle shaped flying object made no noise. no airplanes were in the sky at the time. four ufos were in unison. objects spun around in a circular motion, not fast rather at normal speed. the beat was 1,2,3, hit(on the hit they would all collide and bounce out). after about 5 min. one of the four objects separated from the rest to the upper left out of sync with the others it hovered by itself while the other three continued the cycle. it then joined back up with the other 3 objects, to make four and then over some time the objects faded away. they did not fly away they just eventually disappeared. maybe 4 min. later a plane appeared in the sky but i am close to an airport, which is really funny because during the time there were no planes in the sky at all. very strange definitely witnessed the ufo and i was not alone as a friend was with me and witnessed it too."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-78.652134","Case Number":"48524","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"37.435223","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Four UFO Objects In Sky","Sighting Duration":"00:14:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48524.html"],"Log Number":"US-06302013-0014","Region":"Virginia","Date of the Event":"06/29/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.435223,+-78.652134(48524)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48524) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/30/2013 12:00 UTC"}
