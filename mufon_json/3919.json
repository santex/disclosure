Looking up at the eastern sky above columbus ohio. Facing eastern sky I see two intensily bright white lights like stars or the planet venus just sitting there no movement. They are 1 to two inches apart from each other like twins. Same intensity and brightness. I begin to notice that they start to move exactly the same speed and direction to each other. They move for about ten seconds and while moving at about ten seconds the brightness of light dims to blend in with the hue of the sky at night. Like someone turning the reo-stat from full gain to zero gain. a gradual fading to nothing."],"City":"Columbus","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"3919"}
