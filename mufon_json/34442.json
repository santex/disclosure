I felt scared of what I had just seen so I told my wife about it and she went out side to see if she could see anything, all she observed was what appeared to be a smoke trail. I lost sight of the object when it disappeared, it did not fade it just disappeared."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-108.905939","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.7661,+-108.905939(34442)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34442) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Large white light with \"whooshing sound\" Traveled east to west for some distance","Region":"Colorado","City":"Dove Creek","Log Number":"US-12312011-0026","Latitude":"37.7661","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"12/31/2011 08:19 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34442.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34442.html"]}
