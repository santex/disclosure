For the next 2 hours I watched up to 27 bright red and orange slow moving lights follow the same flight path from North to South. I could not hear ANY sound from the objects. This makes me think that It was not a normal aircraft. The Lights were intense so I could not make out any clear shape of the actual object. I eventually saw up to 5 objects together moving along the same path. This whole process went on for approx. 2 Hours then it stopped. My neighbors witnessed the same event. They tried to take some digital pictures. A few young people stopped and observed the same lights and promptly called 911 to report the UFO. I was very excited to see a UFO finally and to see several was great! I called a few relatives to let them know about the sightings. The next day I tried to call the local television news and they were only interested if I had pictures or Video."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/16/2009 08:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-01172009-0004","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Case Number":"14958","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.347","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.282273,+-80.347(14958)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14958) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14958.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14958.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
