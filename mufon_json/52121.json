I looked to my wife and said \" look at that it, it can't be an airplane, it doesn't have any blinking lights\" she said \"yeah you're right\". We observed it for about 15-30 seconds before the light in the sky appeared to vanish, but not a second later it re appeared in the sky along with two other bright orbs spaced a few hundred feet above it in a vertical formation. They began to decend and they eventually fell behind tree level. Were hoping that we are not the only ones to have noticed these three strange orbs in the sky tonight, but I'm most certainly positive that they were not airplanes or helicopters."],"Latitude":"35.058064","Region":"North Carolina","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/08/2013 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.058064,+-78.877358(52121)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52121) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Summary":"Bright lights seen from Fayetteville NC","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Fayetteville","There were no other sightings in Fayetteville on or around November 8th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52121.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52121.html"],"City":"Fayetteville","Case Number":"52121"}
