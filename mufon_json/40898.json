After I got several peoples attention the light turned off and I could see a little black circle that seemed to rise (getting futher away/up) as well as continue to fly straight.","Region":"Illinois","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in pulaski and 149th","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
