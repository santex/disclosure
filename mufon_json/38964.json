I pointed it out to my husband, and while I was trying to get him to lock eyes on it - as it was moving faily swiftly - he noticed a different \"star\" doing the same thing. At first, I didn't notice the second one moving, and I passed it off as just a bright planet, and continued to get my husband to see the first moving light. About the time that he finally saw what I was looking at, I noticed the \"planet-like\" light was also moving, only in a NE direction. Both appeared to be traveling at the exact same speed, and both were solid, unblinking lights. There was absolutely no sound, and both moved across the sky, out of our sight within no more than a minute and a half. Both appeared to be far above our atmosphere, possibly orbiting earth, or just passing by."],"Date Submitted":"06/07/2012 11:58 UTC","Summary":"solid lights, one star-like & one planet-like, over Lenexa","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Lenexa","Region":"Kansas","Country":"United States"}
