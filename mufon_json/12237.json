I looked up to see high in the sky right north of town some thing reentering the atmosfear it looked like how the Space Shuttle looks on reentry only lasting for about 1-2 seconds(I'm not sure if I saw all of the reentry after I saw it it did get brighter but could have already bin reentering?)Then it stopped burning or glowing from reentry and was hard to see but it looked light gray and about the size of a BB held out at arms length and it ether slowed down its fall or started flying away from us to the north no con trail. I'm not sure how fast it was going but it looked to me like it was moving slow for an aircraft or not as fast as a jet would. The hole thing only lasted just a few secons and then I lost it and couldn't see it any more this was no Meteorite it was under control it looked like to me. As soon as I saw it I told my Mom look and she said what is that? I told her maybe space junk or some thing I'm not sure its kind of strange for some thing to slow down after reentry, I'll have to report it to MUFON to see if any one ells saw it."],"Date Submitted":"08/25/2008 08:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-98.478596","Log Number":"US-08272008-0008","Date of the Event":"08/25/2008 08:15 UTC","Region":"Kansas","Summary":"Reentry of some thing that slowed down and leveled off","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.019132","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12237.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12237.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:07","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed"}
