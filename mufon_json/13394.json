{"Log Number":"US-10302008-0017","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-79.928912","divs":["Sighting DetailsLarge object moving east-south-east around 21.45 on October 27th 2008. Triangular shape. NO Noise. Flying low and slow at about 1000 ft. The lights at the three ends of the object were not lit up - only the light in the middle, and that was very faint orange. Object looked to have some sort of toroidal-spheroid object in the middle where the orange light was emanating from, but the light was indirect. Object moved across the sky slowly and occasionally would \"wobble\" or move very fast to another point on the same plane sideways that it was on originally and then continue to fly east-south-east. Object appeared to start to descend as the lights were dimming probably over Charleston Harbor. This lasted about 1.30 - 2 minutes."],"Region":"South Carolina","Summary":"Large silent triangle moved from horizon to horizon","Date of the Event":"10/27/2008 09:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.782586","Case Number":"13394","City":"Charleston","Date Submitted":"10/27/2008 09:45 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13394.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13394.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Charleston","There were no other sightings in Charleston on or around October 27th 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Other","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.782586,+-79.928912(13394)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13394) map </A>"}
