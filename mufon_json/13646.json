We were driving from Petoskey to East Jordan and we saw this in Charlevoix on our left. One was higher and larger than the other with no color but they were close together. They were there brightly and remained for about 10 seconds then disappeared. My husband asked if I had seen what he seen and we were both puzzled. The light was shining down...not up and the weather was cloudy and sleeting and snowing."],"Log Number":"US-11102008-0021","Date of the Event":"11/10/2008 05:20 UTC","Longitude":"-85.25337","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.326613","Date Submitted":"11/10/2008 05:20 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
