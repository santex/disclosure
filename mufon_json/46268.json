It was over a section of uninhabited mountains to the south of where we were. It caught my eye because it was so odd. I called to my husband to look but he was driving and wouldn't pull over. I watched as the object, which appeared to be disc-like or circular, rotated these liquid multi-colored lights and sort of hovered over the mountain. It then moved around and it descended. After it descended the entire area was like a magnet for all of these helicopters that appeared. Several of them had search lights. I kept looking for the object but at that point it seemed it had landed and was not observable from my position. However the number of helicopters with searchlights continued to grow as we went to a nearby store and left about half an hour later. The entire mountain was crawling with at least a dozen helicopters."],"Date of the Event":"03/02/2013 08:30 UTC","Summary":"liquid looking lights that rotated in a circle hovering over mountain","Region":"California","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.155874","City":"Burbank","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering"}
