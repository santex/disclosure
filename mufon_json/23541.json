{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05312010-0001","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/31/2010 12:31 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting outside in a friend's backyard, I noticed what I assumed was a plane in the night sky. It was moving across the sky like normal, and then came to a complete stop. It stayed in place for a long time, and I said to my friends what I had just seen. Because it was no longer moving, everyone around me was convinced that it was just a star, and that I had imagined it moving. However, I strongly believe what I saw moved for the couple of minutes from when I first noticed it and then came to a halt. I felt surprised and excited, but mostly alarmed."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23541.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23541.html"],"City":"Worth","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Longitude":"-87.797275","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Worth","There were no other sightings in Worth on or around May 29th 2010"],"Latitude":"41.689755","Case Number":"23541","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"moving star","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.689755,+-87.797275(23541)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23541) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/29/2010 09:00 UTC","Country":"United States"}
