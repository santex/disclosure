It was circular in appearance. It quickly turned super bright white in color.. hovered for a few seconds and moved in a diagonal downward direction for around 2 seconds and then it was gone. It was like it disintegrated or something. My son who is 8 is also a witness including myself. My neighbors were not quick to see the event. It only lasted around 15 seconds. My son and I do not know what this could have been other than it being a UFO. It was definitely not a plane nor fireworks. It made no noise that we heard. It appeared out of nowhere and disappeared into thin air. Did anyone else happen to see this in the area?"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-07212012-0003","Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/21/2012 03:28 UTC","Case Number":"40968","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around July 19th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Washington","Longitude":"-89.400712","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Latitude":"40.705018","Summary":"Round ufo appeared out of nowhere","Date of the Event":"07/19/2012 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40968.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40968.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
