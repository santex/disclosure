I am a little offended to be asked if Arlington airport ran at night, indicating I may have seen an airplane's strobe, or landing lights, or running lights. I have lived next to the airport for 30 years. I have seen hundreds of planes landing at night. I have also seen a tumbling fuel tank at night from a shuttle launch. I may have been a very large piece of shiny space junk that had a very slow tumble, and I may have seen it at the moment it aligned with the sun, giving it that that one brilliant burst of light. If anybody has any better suggestion, I would like to know!"],"Date Submitted":"08/16/2010 03:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25104.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25104.html"],"Log Number":"US-08162010-0001","Latitude":"48.201562","Region":"Washington","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.201562,+-122.122202(25104)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25104) map </A>","Summary":"Maybe space garbage.","Date of the Event":"08/15/2010 02:47 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
