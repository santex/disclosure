She remained asleep. I looked out ALL the windows thinking it was a snow removal vehicle or a tow truck. There was NOTHING there, and the windows allowed me a full view of the street from all directions. Nothing there, even tho the lights continued to shine thru the windows. I figured it must've been \"them\" so I just went back to sleep. Didn't freak me out, was just really tired and went back to sleep. Was really wierd.
