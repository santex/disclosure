That is the reason I quickly rode home and checked flight aware.I lost sight of the object when it went out of my viewing distance."],"Date of the Event":"09/20/2012 07:00 UTC","Summary":"I saw this UFO while riding my dirt bike.It was black and saucer shaped with a wide contrail behind it","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Joliet","There were no other sightings in Joliet on or around September 20th 2012"],"Case Number":"42682","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42682.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42682.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/20/2012 09:05 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Joliet","Region":"Illinois","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.518059","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-88.175255"}
