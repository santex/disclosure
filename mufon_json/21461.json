As he was setting up, he noticed two bright objects in the sky. They are in the eastern sky. Not close to each other at all. They can be seen with the naked eye. Looking in the telescope you can see that the objects are in the shape of a circle. The one on the right is much larger than the other one. They appear to be moving but at a very slow rate. They are rapidly changing colors. This has been ongoing for about 30 minutes now and my son is still outside watching them through the telescope."]}
