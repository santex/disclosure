At the end of elder road, I noticed orange glowing lights out in a field up in the sky. I asked my husband to look and he was clueless as to what it was. We drove closer to the light s where the field was and turned the car off to see if we heard any thing. There were no noise, just 3 clusters of about 4 saucer disk like glowing things hovering. I went home(one mile away) to get my siste. They were still there and she too was able to witness. There were no street lights around... I youtubed ufo sitings near athens,ga and the saucers posted in 2008 look identical as what we saw."],"Date of the Event":"09/24/2011 09:00 UTC"}
