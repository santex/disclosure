{"Date of the Event":"01/19/2012 05:58 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile stopped at a stoplight, I looked up and directly in front of vehicle. Saw what I thought was a really bright star or planet to be more exact. Turned to ask passenger what she thought it was. Turned back to point it out but it had dimmed significantly. Continued to watch light and thought I saw some slight movement which turned into definite movement across the sky westward. The light seemed to waver up and down slightly as it moved across the sky. Verified waver as the light passed behind a traffic light in direct view and could see the wavering against the stationary arm of the traffic light. Light passed through some very sparse treetops and stopped in a break in the treetops. Seemed to hover for a few seconds then reversed direction and started going away, South or up. My traffic light turned green and I lost sight of it as I was driving. I was extremely excited about the sighting because it was undeniably something unusual. There is an airport very close to the location and this object was nothing like a plane. No blinking. A \"floating\" wavering motion across the sky and a hover and direction change. Passenger tried to take video using a cell phone but could not find the light on the phone screen."],"Latitude":"37.348686","Summary":"Bright star then dim and wavering motion","City":"San Jose","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were no other sightings in San Jose on or around January 19th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"01/20/2012 01:34 UTC","Case Number":"35009","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.348686,+-121.890856(35009)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35009) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35009.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35009.html"],"Longitude":"-121.890856","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01202012-0014","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
