His house is high on a hill facing west to the valley below, and the Gore Mountain Range rising above it. The friend who owned the home, noticed a strange object low in the air, across the mountain on the other side. I saw what looked like a balloon above 6 or 7 spherical shaped objects hovering above the ground, and moving northward. The spheres seemed to move individually, yet seemed like they were all connected, as if a cable was attached to them. The spheres seemed opaque. We observed it as it continued to move northward, as if it was probing the area. It would move upward and downward some, but wouldn���t go very high in the air. Numerous times, it would move through treed areas. I thought it would crash, but it just kept moving through the trees, as if the trees were non-existent. I took a picture with my camera phone. One friend got out his binoculars. He watched through the binoculars, as the spheres moved towards a heard of elk. The elk raised up, and went running as the spheres got close to them. We watched it continue northward on it���s probing adventure, till it disappeared out of site, north of us."],"Summary":"Saw 6-7 spherical objects flying, through trees, etc.","Longitude":"-106.071294","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17962.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17962.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.629619","Log Number":"US-07082009-0034","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.629619,+-106.071294(17962)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17962) map </A>","Region":"Colorado","Date Submitted":"07/05/2009 01:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Silverthorne","There were no other sightings in Silverthorne on or around July 5th 2009"]}
