{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-84.122472","Log Number":"US-10162013-0015","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my backyard throwing out the garbage. I often look up at the stars on clear nights. When I looked up this evening I noticed the object, i saw a very bright white light blinking in the middle of the object. The blinking would stop at times and looking somewhat like a headlight. Then blink again. It moved up , down, back and forth. Moved west and then hovered. As it hovered the 2 more bright white lights came on next to the middle light and the 2 lights blinked with no pattern then shut off and the object began to move sw and out of my sight. As I stated before I look at the stars all of the time, I know what planes and helicopters look and sound like. This object made no Sound and there was no smaller red or white beacon light."],"Summary":"Bright white light,blinked and then stayed lit, then 3 lights came on, object hovered","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Dayton","Case Number":"51595","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.713545,+-84.122472(51595)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51595) map </A>","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dayton","There were no other sightings in Dayton on or around October 16th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51595.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51595.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/16/2013 09:53 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/16/2013 09:10 UTC","Latitude":"39.713545","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Ohio","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering"}
