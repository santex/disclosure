I picked a load up in Amorillo Tx. and was going to Salt Lake City Ut. I was taking a short cut north on state hwy 191 (i think thats rihgt) But I was headed north into Utah out of Arizona. As I was climbing a hill.I saw a bright light come out of the sky towards me. As it got closer to me I noticed that I could see thru it. When it got within 30 feet or so from me and my truck it darted to the right(east) and I lost sight of this (orb)Light. It was a beutiful day with plenty of sunshine.For early december and this light was brighter than rest of its surroundings.I was so shocked by seeing this I pulled to the side of the road after topping the hill and set there wondering what I just saw. Later that evening when I was driving in southern Utah by Green River I saw 2 red lights . One after the other shoot across the sky. That was weird too."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"45944","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Date of the Event":"12/02/2012 02:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-02272013-0013","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-115.029812","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States"}
