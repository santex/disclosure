{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsStepped outside to smoke a cig in front yard. I live in the final approach of MSP west to east approach and am very familiar with aircraft in the sky. I noticed 3 glowing (flaming like) vertical cylindrical objects off to the NW about 8-10 miles away at about 55-60 degrees above the horizon. The 3 objects formed 3 points in the sky like a equal sided triangle until the highest (apex) object moved to the right above the object in the lower right position of the triangle. These two then moved rapidly north at the same altitude then vanished as if the lights went off. The remaining object continued to hover in it's original position until the others vanished then it took a similar coarse at a slower speed to about the same spot then it also vanished. They didn't appear to travel out of sight due to distance but rather they just stopped emitting light so they could not be seen. I considered they might be hot air balloons because the glow seemed to flicker like flames but the speed they traveled was far to fast for balloons. I was able to have my roommate come out and see them also. This is my first experience with a ufo. I'm a 49 yo male with excellent eyesight and was not impaired at the time of the sighting."],"City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/24/2012 12:27 UTC","trends":[],"Object Shape":"Cylinder","Case Number":"39754","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39754.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39754.html"],"Region":"Minnesota","Longitude":"-94.68125","Latitude":"46.738353","Log Number":"US-06242012-0002","Summary":"3 glowing verticle cylinders, then 2 moved north and vanished, 3rd followed soon after","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.738353,+-94.68125(39754)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39754) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 09:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
