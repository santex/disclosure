{"Latitude":"45.125278","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were driving home from dinner when we noticed 5 reddish lights over Rice Lake that seemed to be in a formation. They were hovering in a stationary position. We tried to get off on the next exit in time to get a picture of the lights but the went from 5 to 3 as we were exiting. By the time we got off the exit and were able to pull over there was one light remaining which proceeded to disappear before we could get a picture. My wife and two children were in the car and saw the lights as well. As the last light went out the street lights turned off. Then as we drove up a block and turned down our street we noticed the power had gone out in a 4-5 block radius. Not sure if the two are related but it was strange."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47961.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47961.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/08/2013 01:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Maple Grove","There were no other sightings in Maple Grove on or around June 7th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"06/07/2013 10:45 UTC","Case Number":"47961","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Minnesota","Longitude":"-93.48888","Summary":"5 lights hovered over lake","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-06082013-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.125278,+-93.48888(47961)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47961) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"Maple Grove"}
