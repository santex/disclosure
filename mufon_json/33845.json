At 6:45am ( I checked my watch when I first saw the object ), I saw a very bright light in the sky which was much brighter than a star and about twice as big as the apparent size of a star. The object was falling straight down toward the ground which made me at first think it was a falling star or meteor, but before it came in contact with the ground, it began to bounce along above the horizon, then did a complete circle in the air, then shot straight up and disappeared. After seeing this I was convinced I had not seen a meteor and no aircraft that I am familiar with cound have performed these motions."],"Object Features":"None"}
