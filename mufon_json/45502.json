They where spaced a moderate distance apart and they formed a triangle. I had the impression that they were the ends of a large triangle shaped object. They were brighter than helicopter lights but about the normal height you see a helicopter around here. I sat there for a few minutes looking trying to figure out what it was, but had I to go run a errand so I could not watch it longer. I see planes and helicopters all the time around here, but Ive never seen anythign like that before."],"Log Number":"US-01312013-0010","City":"Cape Coral","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.565574,+-81.940693(45502)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45502) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"45502","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","Summary":"I was about to merge onto veterans pkwy and to my left i saw 3 lights hovering in a tringle shape not moving.","Latitude":"26.565574"}
