I was messing with it on this day and walked outside to film my dogs running in the yard. This was the very first time I recorded anything on this tablet. As I filmed the dogs I was walking in the yard. I seen the neighbor and his dogs in his yard and said hi to him and he walked over to the fence,as we stopped to talk I just held the tablet in my hand. When I cam in the house to look at the recording I seen this object go by in the sky. I was not in the house 15 seconds and went back outside and looked in the sky thinking it was a balloon floating by. There was no balloon. So I thought I'd send it to you guys to look at."],"Region":"Tennessee","Date Submitted":"02/12/2012 04:25 UTC","Latitude":"35.242691","Case Number":"35646","Longitude":"-85.690697"}
