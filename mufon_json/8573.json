'of course it was not a ufo'. we speculated that the lights were from a light aircraft as we knew that there was a grass landing strip across the mudflats and we envisioned a cessna of something having just landed or was preparing for takeoff. as it got darker and the group of lights -some flashing, some constant - looked less like an airplane as we know it and we discussed a faint dome shape slightly above the lights but apparently slightly detached from them as i remember it. we debated the possibility that it was not an aircraft. i remember saying that \"if it's an airplane that has landed, wouldn't the pilot have switched off the lights by now and gone home\" and \"if he was going to take off, wouldn't he have done it by now?\". there was no noise. we were also discussing three separate lights which were not visible when we first saw the first light(s). these lights were to the north of the original light and were single white lights about the same intensity as a street light (although there were no street lights around at the time - probably aren't today either). i felt that they were also about the same height as a street light would be- and they were about 700 meters away initially. my brother began to ridicule myself and my friend over our continued interest in these strange lights. but we remained curious, particularly as they seemed more unusual as the sky grew darker. repeatedly, leaving my brother behind, we walked out onto the mudflats to get a closer look and a wider angle look than what was available at the campfire. walking out onto the mudflats allowed us to somewhat see past a small hill at the eastern end of our beach where we had set up camp. over time we noticed that the three small 'street light like' lights were making their way towards us (via the shoreline) while the original group of lights stayed put. we also observed on our second trip out on the mudflats, that when a car went by on the quiet country road behind where the lights were, they'd all dim out to such a point that you could no longer see them unless you had never taken your eyes off them. as such a car then drew away into the distance again, the lights grew back to their original strengths. we made our way back to campfire to tell my brother of our observations. he eventually reluctantly came out onto the mudflats to get a full view. he made the observation that: yes indeed the three smaller lights were making their way towards us. we were able to demonstrate the truth about how all lights dimmed as a car drove by than grew back to strength as the car drew away. when he saw these things for himself he had a change of tone: \"it's time to get out of here\" or similar words. we ran across the mudflats. threw sand on the fire, grabbed our push bikes and began to run up the hill to the main track running from east to west along preces point. our imaginations allowed us to believe that \"they\" might be able to detect metal - so we ditched our push bikes. we got to the main track and ran about 50 - 100 meters eastwards. enough to get us to a clear view of what we'd been looking at from on the mudflats, but also a clear view of the other side of the small hill that was just to the east of our original camp fire. from here we could see where the original light(s) were. but they were there no more. i felt the three smaller lights also should be visible, going by where they were when we decided to flee. they were not there either, at least not in the same shape. what we saw from the top of the hill and almost straight below us about 30 - 60 meters away was a large white circular light, with clearly defined edges that did not seem to illuminate anything around it. it was glowing creamy white and had a matrix pattern across the top of it. the pattern was formed by areas that were not quite so brightly illuminated as the rest of the object. overall the matrix formed diamond like shapes that were not so large at the edges of the sphere \\ disk as they were towards the center of it (we were looking down on it). the total area was the size of a small house. beside this, and i guess about 7 meters from the big light were two other objects. they were almost rectangular in shape and were standing vertically along their long edge. they were rectangular except that they had 45 degree features at their four corners. they also had a diamond like pattern although it was consistent in size across their entire surface. the light that they emitted was consistent in colour and character to that of the larger round disk like \\ sphere like light except that they were pulsating. going on and off in synchronous with one another except that when one was on the other was off. we looked at this all and discussed what were seeing. it seemed like we could just stay here forever and just watch what we saw! we talked about all the detail mentioned above and we contemplated throwing a rock on the disk like object. this idea was rejected. we eventually fled the scene holding hands. days later we saw news of the kaikoura coast(nz)ufo sightings which i understand got 5 minutes on cbs world news."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Auckland","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/15/1978 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8573.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8573.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-36.83992,+174.769242(8573)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8573) map </A>","Log Number":"NZ-12082007-0004","Longitude":"174.769242"}
