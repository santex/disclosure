{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsit was friday morning and at the time i was knitting and talking on the phone with my grandson. my husband called me to the kitchen for some reason i don't know. my front kitchen window oversees west. i quickly turned my head to the upper right side of my window and i saw what i now know it to be an object shaped like a cigar zig zagging from left to right. at first i thought it was a kite because i didn't have my glasses on. but i continued watching the object.because it started becoming bigger as it moved closer to the center of the window. i saw it was a cigar shaped grey blacksih color as it zoomed by my house. i ran to my backyard and looked at the sky, it was kind of cloudy but i could clearly see the object next to some cloud. i stood there with amazement and shouted for my husband to come, he couldn't make it b\\c he was upstairs and couldn't hear me. after 2 minutes of the observation i saw the onbject punch a hole in the cloud and went upward into the atmosphere. i walked to my kitchen and shouted for my husband to come downstairs. i told him everything but he was skeptical and continued to tell me it was something like a bird b\\c i didnt have my glasses. i put my glasses and showed my husband the hole in the cloud, he was skeptical and kept telling me it was probably a helicopter or plane. i went back to the phone and told my grandson everything. so far 20 minutes had expired since the first sighting on my kitchen window. i hung up my phone went to the sofa in the living room and watched the price is right for about 10 minutes. i got up and grabbed a cup of water when i saw a shadow coming up my driveway. i went to the garage with my camera. i saw the object go through my side backyard fence, i ran through my kitchen and into the backyard, i saw what appeared to be a man in black ran back again through the side fence and into my driveway, and quickly followed and took this photo as he was looking back at me. it was so scary that i ran back and told my husband, he called his friend and they were with us for about 2 hours. we didn't call the police department because he didn't think it was neccessary eventhough i kept telling him it was trespassing. next thing i knew i was on the computer learning more about mufon. around 40 minutes had expired. i don't know why a man in black would suddenly appear on my house right after this ufo sightings? quite mysterious looking man. i reported this saturday."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.201937,+-117.235726(12915)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12915) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12915.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12915_submitter_file1__CIMG6430.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12915.html"],"Latitude":"33.201937","Log Number":"US-10042008-0003","Summary":"Talking on phone, then saw object, then saw man in black stalking my house.
