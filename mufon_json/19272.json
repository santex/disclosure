When I looked up, in an area of trees was what I thought were three birds. I decided to watch them because they appeared to be flying strangely. A few seconds later I realized they were not birds. As the vehicle moved towards me, it was climbing rapidly with the chevrons spinning at a constant speed. From the time i first saw it had probably climbed ten thousand feet and was between ten to fifteen thousand feet. Finally, a few seconds later, it was directly overhead. Then it just disappeared. One second it was there, the next second it wasn't. It had gone into another dimension. It made my day. I have wanted to see a UFO all my life, and now it has finally happened."],"Object Features":"Wings","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19272.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19272.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Norwich","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.633966,+1.300865(19272)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19272) map </A>","Longitude":"1.300865","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Norwich","There were no other sightings in Norwich on or around September 12th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Round disk with chevrons on the underside.","Case Number":"19272","Country":"United Kingdom","Region":"England","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
