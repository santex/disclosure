{"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","divs":["Sighting DetailsAugust 1960. I was in the U.S. Air Force stationed at RAF Chicksands, Chicksands Priory, Bedfordshire, England. On August 12th, the U.S. had launched the ECHO 1A Communications Satellite (actually it was a great big mylar balloon that reflected radio signals). It was big enough to be visible to the naked eye. A few days later, some of my co-workers and I got the times and positions in the sky where ECHO would be visible in our part of the world. We went outside to watch for ECHO and were watching the spot where it would come up over the horizon. Right on time, there it was! And it had a friend, a fellow traveler. There were two bright specks moving across the sky, not just one. They passed directly overhead. Then one of them made a 180 degree turn and went back the way it had come. We went to the coffee shop and discussed what we had seen, but no one had any idea what it might have been."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15149.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15149.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.144589,+-0.454701(15149)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15149) map </A>","Summary":"Unidentified object paces ECHO 1A communications satellite.","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United Kingdom","Case Number":"15149","Region":"England","City":"Bedford","Date of the Event":"08/16/1960 09:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Bedford","There were no other sightings in Bedford on or around August 16th 1960"],"Longitude":"-0.454701","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/16/1960 09:15 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Latitude":"52.144589","Log Number":"GB-01272009-0003"}
