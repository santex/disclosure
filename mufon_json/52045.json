I've looked up some reactions to this \"Venus planet\" on Youtube and many people don't believe that it is Venus. I stopped and took some zoomed in photos the beginning of October, but the quality of my cellphone camera is pretty crappy, but judge for yourself on these two pictures that I am uploading on here what you make of it. I am someone who has had many sightings and have reported most all to MUFON so when I see an unusual, unexplainable light that just looks out of place, I try to observe and capture it if possible on photo.
