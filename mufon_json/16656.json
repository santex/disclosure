{"Disposition":"IFO","divs":["Sighting DetailsHello, I am a mentally handicap disabled person with slow learning disability. This morning, before I was on my way to the bus stop on 63rd & Austin, I happen to look to the east looking over the lake, I saw this huge bright light in the sky. I do NOT know what in the hell that I���m seeing here, however the object seems to be standing still as this thing was kind of twinkling or flashing in some sort of a way. I���ve took out my little Digital HD camcorder; and shot this object thing for over a minute. After I���ve got done shooting and but my camcorder back in my work bag it was gone just like that! PLEASE!!! Just tell me!!! What is it that I am seeing here??? Can you tell me what it is??? Note*** Please do not contact me by cell phone, due do that fact that I may get charges for making and receiving extra long distance charges, that may reflect on my cell phone bill; unless if this is an extreme absolute emergency!!!... Thank you very much."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/24/2009 04:55 UTC","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around April 24th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Chicago","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"What is this that I'm seeing here???","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.786672,+-87.750816(16656)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16656) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16656.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16656.html"],"Case Number":"16656","Longitude":"-87.750816","Log Number":"US-04242009-0003","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","Date Submitted":"04/24/2009 04:55 UTC","Latitude":"41.786672"}
