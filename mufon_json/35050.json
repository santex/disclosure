{"Summary":"Object moved west to east much slower than metoer, much faster than jet","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn my way to work at 6:35 am I saw a bright light through my windshield. At first I thought it was a reflection of headlights behind me, but I had just checked my mirror and nothing was there. I instantly looked at the light and followed it with my eyes for approx. 2 seconds. I was still driving, so I checked the road ahead of me and looked back but the object was gone. The sun had not come up yet, but it was bright enough for me to see a few small clouds and contrails from commercial aircraft. This object left no visible contrail. I am 44 years old and have seen many shooting stars, jets, planes, etc. This object moved much slower than a shooting star but much faster than a jet. It appeared to be at an altitude similar to small aircraft. It moved west to east. This happened between Hastings and Elkton FL. on Friday Jan 20, 2012. I have always been a sky watcher, but I have never seen anything I couldn't explain until now. Hopefully this will back another person's observation."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-81.508134","Date of the Event":"01/20/2012 06:35 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"35050","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"29.718025","City":"Hastings","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35050.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35050.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.718025,+-81.508134(35050)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35050) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/22/2012 07:16 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hastings","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01222012-0005"}
