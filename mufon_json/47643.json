{"Date of the Event":"05/25/2013 09:20 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 9:20, May 25th 2013, I took my dogs to the backyard like I do every evening. Looked up in the NW direction of Tucson Arizona,and was surprised to see about 20-30 red blinking lights just about 30-40 degrees over the horizon. Could not have been helicopters, planes or balloons so I went in to have my mother observe them. She concurred with my assessment. During the time of observation, 15 minutes total, many of the objects were stationary yet many moved in different directions. Soon they all faded away. We waited a few more minutes and they all reappeared. Most of them hovering but two went very high in the sky. At this time we observed a plane flying to the left of them. The plane could have been a commercial one, but shortly after seeing it, the objects faded away and were not seen again."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","City":"Tucson","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47643.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47643.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Date Submitted":"05/26/2013 01:32 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-05262013-0010","Summary":"On May 25th,2013,at 9;20PM several glowing objects were seen inear NW horizon.","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.238715,+-110.820077(47643)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47643) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"47643","Longitude":"-110.820077","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around May 25th 2013"],"Latitude":"32.238715"}
