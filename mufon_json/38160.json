I thought thats strange ive never seen that star there before and continued driving. 20 minutes later i noticed the exact same light about 60 degrees to the left and thought what the hell is going on. As i drove I couldnt help but just stare at this light, while staring at the light it abruptly vanished only to reappear 10 seconds later about 30 degrees to the right. At that point I had the chills and didnt kmow what it could possibly be. I watched it for another 12 miles til it went behind one the big hills over selah, wa. Dont know what it was but I really want to know what can move and vanish like that. Just to add there is a military training base in yakima wa, possibly it could have been a military test of some sort."],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","City":"Yakima","Date Submitted":"05/15/2012 01:46 UTC","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38160.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38160.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Washington","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05152012-0011","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"46.606211","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Longitude":"-120.499999"}
