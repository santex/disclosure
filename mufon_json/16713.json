It had strobing red , white and green lights and other white lights along its sides . Altitude was 100 feet or less , and it was completly silent , no rotor or engine sounds at all . Its length was about 50 feet or so between the strobing outer lights on the object , and was moving very slow through the sky . It was heading south for the river and crossing it when i lost sight of it ( due to building obstruction ). The object turned to the right and i saw it again heading west on the other side of the river . I lost sight of it when it went behind the hills . Total time of the sighting was 2 minutes or so . With its strobing and lighting on it . It looked like the object i saw on the night of January seventh of this year . I wish i would have seen it in daylight to see what shape it was ."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16713.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16713.html"],"City":"Knoxville","Latitude":"35.964548","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.964548,+-83.917939(16713)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16713) map </A>","Summary":"Bright lighted object over the Tennessee River in Knoxville.","Date Submitted":"04/28/2009 05:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Tennessee","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-04282009-0010","trends":["There have been 50 other sightings in Knoxville","There were no other sightings in Knoxville on or around April 28th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"16713","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/28/2009 05:30 UTC"}
