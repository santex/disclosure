I was listening to st johns church bells rang at 6\"00 am I was looking at orion in the early sky when I saw a solid star traveling probably 12-20 thousand miles an hour. Altitude was 80-120 thousand ft. Probably space station . star was very bright reflective of the sun in the horizon. Should appear tonight if it is a satellite tracking that course. I live on a golf course so the stars are quite bright with low ground light . I notices a two star object 30 days ago . had to be humongous . same altitude but distance between stars either made it huge or two objects on perfect path linear.no variance.I am sure this was a large satellite ..seemed to be traveling in orbital state."],"trends":["There have been 62 other sightings in Memphis","There were no other sightings in Memphis on or around September 12th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/12/2013 07:43 UTC"}
