{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Poplar Bluff","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy truck was facing south on Nooney St. Poplar Bluff Mo. On my way to work on Aug 9 at 5:28. As I reached for the door handle I looked up and thought to myself wow the moon is bright, definitely full. Entering the truck I thought to myself the moon should be close to new moon phase now. So I looked up through the windshield to confirm. Yes, that's the moon alright, and it's full. A couple of minutes later (approx. 4 blocks) as I turned on to Main St. I had an unobstructed view of a perfect crescent moon. I continued driving to work another mile or so then I thought, wait, if I see the crescent moon now what was the light I thought was the full moon? I thought... there was no sound, there was no movement. Strange, very strange."],"Latitude":"36.766604","Summary":"thought I was looking at full moon. driving to work four blocks later in a diferent direction saw cresent moon?","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.766604,+-90.399539(50004)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50004) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/19/2013 10:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50004.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50004.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/09/2013 05:28 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Poplar Bluff","There were no other sightings in Poplar Bluff on or around August 9th 2013"],"Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"50004","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-90.399539","Log Number":"US-08192013-0013"}
