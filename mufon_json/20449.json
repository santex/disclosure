We had turned into our subdivision and topped a hill when I noticed a red stationary object in the sky. I thought it was a reflection on the windshield at first but then it blinked off. I pulled the car over and looked up and I saw it blink on again not far from where I had first seen it. It was stationary once again and lasted for about 30 seconds then blinked out. I rushed home, pulled into the driveway, jumped out of the car and waited for a few minutes and then I saw it again quite a bit farther. This was the last time I saw it blink on, hover and blink off and it was gone. It was very exciting for me and my son. So glad to see that I was not the only one in my area who saw it!!"],"Log Number":"US-11102009-0025","Sighting Duration":"05:00:00","Object Shape":"Circle","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.226821,+-95.225504(20449)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20449) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/10/2009 07:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"11/10/2009 10:34 UTC","Latitude":"32.226821","Weather Factors":"None"}
