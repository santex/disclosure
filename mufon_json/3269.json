{"Region":"Florida","divs":["sighting detailssighting report: daate: fri. jan. 21, 2005 time: 5:10 pm place: lakeland, fl. street: south florida ave. area: sw area of lakeland. time: 5 - 8 minutes. weather: cool. 70 s? clear sky w\\ 2 patches of puffy clouds to my left and one to the right. description: i was traveling in my car heading south on south florida ave. i noticed two incoming planes to our small local airport. the first was a familiar jet, and the second was an old craft that was perhaps closer to the 40 s. following the second craft, (stopped at a red light)i noticed a large, round silver object in the sw sky above where both planes had flown into lakeland and then on to the airport. holding up a pencil, it was approx. the size of a round eraser end at the end of a pencil. i first thought it was the sun reflecting on a plane, but the sun had set. then i thought it might be a helicopter with a light on the front, but the light was too large and it wasn t moving. then, i thought perhaps it might be an experimental plane such as those that come in to our sun n fun in april. (later, i checked with a flight safety man from our airport, asking a series of questions, and he said experimentals would not have large lights) here is the sequence: the light did not flicker, but remained bright and steady before going out each time. 1. a large silver object with relection. 2. it changed to a large light. 3. it imploded - disappeared. 4. next stop light, a smaller light appeared. 5. it imploded - disappeared. 6. next stop light, a third and even smaller light appeared. 7. it imploded - disappeared. 8. the ususual military jets that fly overhead on a regular basis, then appeared and was seen above where the object\\light was seen. 9. two days later, going in the same direction, i saw the same familiar military jet, which normally flies at an extremely high altitude, was seen flying towards the area where i had the sighting. the jet circled the area, leaving a small round trail where the object had been seen, and then turned completely around and went back in the opposite direction. i see these jets regularly across our skies, and i ve never seen one down that low or perfom that kind of maneuver. they normally travel across the sky in a straight line. note: earlier that day, high frequency to r ear followed by pain and a nose bleed. two hours later, sighting. important to note for me: 92 encounter began from that same area at 5:30, with craft, entities, and followed by an energy field to room two weeks later. *i would appreciate a contact from mufon, as i have been trying to find a way to report a story to the journal. *my journals have stopped arriving at my home and i am trying to get help from the post office. * i have filed a report with nuforc as to the extent of the activities i have been experiencing over the last several years. thanks to mary margaret, bland pugh and to peter davenport for their help in the past and for any assistance and followup they can give. thanks to john schuessler for his leadership. lakeland does not have a local director, and i look to mufon for their assistance."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/29/2005 10:28 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"","Latitude":"28.043915","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3269.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3269.html"],"Longitude":"-81.945974","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.043915,+-81.945974(3269)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3269) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Lakeland","Summary":"Not Provided","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Lakeland","There were no other sightings in Lakeland on or around January 29th 2005"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"3269","Date Submitted":"01/29/2005 10:28 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
