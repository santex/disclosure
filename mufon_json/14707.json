It was located in fround of me. It then quickly moved to the left of my car and the bright light was shut off, when the bright light was off i noticed 3 smaller lights in a row. The craft then quickly moved to the right side of the street and hovered there for a while. I kept my eye on it until I lost it for 2 seconds while driving past a tall tree. Once past the tree the object was gone completely. No sight of it at all. The whole time I was baffled as to what it could be moving in such an odd pattern and with such odd lights."],"Region":"Massachusetts","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.748162,+-71.189562(14707)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14707) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.748162","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/01/2009 05:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/01/2009 05:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-01022009-0022","City":"Swansea","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14707.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14707_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14707.html"]}
