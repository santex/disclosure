But then it was observed that the light was not moving as an airplane should, just hovering above a low-hanging cloud. It hovered there for a good ten minutes, fascinating to me and my friend. Then a surprising thing happened, which confirmed at least for myself the nature of the light--it appeared to shrink, it got smaller and smaller until it finally wasn't there anymore. This makes me think that it was aware of my presence because in order for it to appear as if it shrunk out of existence it had to have departed along the same angle as my vantage point. This was the first UFO I've ever seen with my own two eyes so I was excited and elated.
