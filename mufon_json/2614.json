Wewere at 35 Great Jones St. I think thats the exact addresson the roof, which is6 stories high. There were about 6 of us there, all adults. It was a hot day andit was dark out, so we were just trying to make the best of it. I saw an objectflying more or less parallel to the roof. It looked, if I had to describe it,like two a really big black Hefty garbage bag, just sailing by. It made nosound, and it was going straight across at a decent speed... so it HAD to havesome sort of motor. I mentioned it to the others who saw it, and then we watchedit. As it floated away from us, hundreds of tiny lights inside it startedblinking But very faintly... they were like the small christmas lights. Thatsit. Then it left our view. I guess it to be some sort of Government thing outthere sniffing the air. But it wasnt some sort of home made prank... because bythe way it went straight across with no sound, it was strange."],"Case Number":"2614","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around August 14th 2003"],"Summary":"UFO during recent blackout","Date Submitted":"08/14/2003 03:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York"}
