While driving on the busy street of Portage Ave, I stopped at a red light and noticed to the North-East direction what I thought was a plane off in the distance with contrails beginning to emit from the plane. It remained stationary and I continued to look up at the object as it now had my attention since it was not moving at all and the contrails looked frozen, or that there were no contrails being emitted anymore. It was pretty high above and far off so I'm not able to pinpoint how high or how far it was. Minutes went by and the there was no movement from it until about 3-4 minutes afterwards, it appeared to get smaller. As it did, it formed into a perfect circle-like shape and it then disappeared in a blink of an eye. I'd like to end this by stating I'm presently a student enrolled at a law enforcement academy and that I report this anonymously. It is also my first sighting."],"Log Number":"CA-07052012-0096","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.900727,+-97.233871(40272)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40272) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Winnipeg","There were no other sightings in Winnipeg on or around July 5th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Other"}
