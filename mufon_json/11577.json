{"divs":["Sighting DetailsNoticed an orange light in the distance as I was watching fire works. The object was heading in my direction. The path was ambling in a \"s\" path with an upward pattern matching the ground contour. Object was about 40-45 feet above ground. Object was rectangular shape. The light was rectangular, evenly orange in color and \"glowed\" without hot spots. Size est 3 ft tall by 2 ft wide. The object came from the east as it went over my neighbors house, making a sweeping 90 degree turn over our road and continued to move turning south away from me. As it turned away from me the frame of the light was sharp and the light looked to be contained in a \"lantern\" shaped box. As the light turned the light reduced in width down to nothing or black. The object moved over my rear neighbors home and disappeared. No loss of time. No other known effects observed. No sounds except fireworks arround the area. I was interviewed by MUFON Field Investigator on 7-12-08."],"Summary":"Luminescent Orange Rectangular Lantern","Log Number":"US-07152008-0009","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Indiana","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Longitude":"-85.843705","Case Number":"11577","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Fortville","There were no other sightings in Fortville on or around July 4th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.934062,+-85.843705(11577)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11577) map </A>","City":"Fortville","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11577.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11577.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"07/04/2008 10:35 UTC","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/04/2008 10:35 UTC","Latitude":"39.934062"}
