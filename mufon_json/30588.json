{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","divs":["Sighting Details 3 of us saw something very odd. lasted about 20 sec. I first spotted 3 slightly blurred, bluish lights travelling very fast in formation in close above Tanglewood during intermission. I poked two friends standing next to me and said the classic \"check that out -- what the hell is it?\" No sound. Seemed close enough to make out fast moving blurred objects. Enough so they didn't seem to be at high altitude. Then the lights moved in and around in each other. We assumed they were jets. My first thought was that they looked like something you'd see Blue Angels doing in an air show. Then the lights moved at such odd angles to each other in what seemed physically impossible changes and seemed to be gaining speed as they moved away. Within seconds they were out of view beyond the treeline horizon."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.282976","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"30588","Region":"Massachusetts","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/02/2011 09:40 UTC","Summary":"3 blurred bluish lights moving in high speed formation, weaving in and around each other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30588.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30588.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/03/2011 11:24 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Lenox","There were no other sightings in Lenox on or around August 2nd 2011"],"Log Number":"US-08032011-0025","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.364961,+-73.282976(30588)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30588) map </A>","City":"Lenox","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.364961"}
