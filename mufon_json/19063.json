{"divs":["sighting detailsmost nights i step outside on my back porch for a smoke. for several months i have noticed a brightly light object in the nw sky about 45 degrees over the horizon. at first the object appeared to be a plane at night, with red, green, and white flashing lights. however, over several nights i noticed that the object does not move - at all. i can track star positions and note their movement across the sky, and can often see planes at various altitudes - all exhibit movement, even though it may be extremely slow. this object does not move. however, on one occaision it changed position in the sky dramatically, at least 30 degrees to the east in a matter of seconds. then returned to roughly the initial sighted position. it is in virtually the same position each night, however there may be very slight differences, as measured against tree or building positions. casual observation would dismiss this as a very distant plane. however, over month of close observation reveals puzzling inconsistencies. these observed differences, inconsistencies are as follows: (1) clouds will obstruct view - even very high cirrus clouds, indicating to me that is above the cloud layer, ruling out helicopters or ballons. (2) it is at least 20% brighter than any plane, except for planes that are at very low altitude. (3) except for one or two cases, there is no measurable movement for entire event, which often lasts several hours. (4) it \"suddenly\" appears, and \"suddenly\" disappears. like turning a switch off and on. (5) besides red and green lights, it sometimes emits blue and yellow\\white lights. on one occaision, i observed a blueish-purple \"streak\" of light. (6) all lights flash, and do not appear to be fixed location on the object. (7) even though the object is very high (indicate by clouds), and is estimated to be 60-80 miles downrange, it appears large and very bright compared to planes. (8) i have witnessed numerous planes at various altitudes coming and going that pass between the object and my line of sight with no deviation in the flight plan\\path of the plane. the assumption is that it is therefore well outside any flight path or altitude vector of commercial aircraft. (9) changing angle of view (such as driving across town to a friends), i often cannot locate the object, but it is once again visible when i return home, or if i call home and ask someone to look. after much careful observation over many night, i am more puzzled than ever. the only explanation i can think of is a geo-stationary satellite - but i have not heard, nor can i find any information, on satellites that have large flashing lights, or that would suddenly \"turn off\", or make occaisional movement, or wouldn't be located in the exact inclination in the sky. i cannot imagine why there would be red and green \"navigational\" lights on a satellite, nor the other colors documented. several friends have seen it with me, but quickly dismiss it as a plane and will not spend the time to watch\\document it for hours to see that there is no motion across the sky, nor wait around until it suddenly \"blinks off\". i am hesitant to report to the authorities based upon my friend's reactions - as i sure no leo will watch it for hours to verify what i am reporting. i can easily show to anyone most any reasonably clear night. it is visible when most stars are obscured (it's that bright). can anyone in mufon shed some light on this? it is really beginning to nag on me the more i watch it. is it a satellite? help!"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09042009-0001","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Plano","There were no other sightings in Plano on or around September 3rd 2009"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright Lit Stationary Object with flashing lights","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.021243","Case Number":"19063","Date of the Event":"09/03/2009 10:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"04:30:00","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Longitude":"-96.690846","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19063.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19063.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/04/2009 12:16 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.021243,+-96.690846(19063)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19063) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Plano","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like, Other","Country":"United States"}
