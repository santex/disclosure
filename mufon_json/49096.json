We were in the house looking out of the front windows. The brightness and the lack of any happenstance ever visible on said forested mountain. Bonfires(campfires) until they ascended and flew away from said mountain. Round, brightly, pulsating red-orange lights. Felt eerie and unnatural, as well as, glad they did not approach our location. They flew in a south-easterly direction until they seemingly just disappeared."]}
