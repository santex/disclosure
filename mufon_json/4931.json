(i never forgot the image!) he insisted it was a helicopter, but i don't see how--i don't believe him. how could he have forgotten??? anyway, he may have been trying to get me off ufos. what he did remember on the same street was a time he was wrestling with the boy across the street when a huge perodyctal (sp?) flying dio fit the description best, but that's the thing my cousin remembered most about wild street! the bird was swwoping down on them like they were food, claws extended! it scared the pants off both boys, and i guess as they jumped up the bird realized it wasn't a rodent or rabbit but two large boys, they ran & got the boy's dad and they went to the library to research birds in tx that big! i forgot which one they decided it was, but i wonder now esp after reading keel, etc.....although we never reported the ufo, i have never forgotten it and it's weird how children put those things away in their minds, how there was just no explanation, now i wish i had thought to reach down and get a rock to see if it \"pinged\" or at least to write down the date, etc. etc. but the image was never forgotten, it was real, no way that close that it was an screen or projection because the bottom was fascinating, maze-like, intricate. i will never, ever forget that minute or so in my life when i saw something! oh, i have never seen another drawing, picture of one that looked even close to this one. the plates just wasn't at all what its shape was, it was round yet squarish compared to the thin plates together if you know what i mean. no windows, no lights just dark gray, yet could see the bubble on top and the very intricate bottom. wow, huh? right over me, whoa! (i don['t believe in the abduction stuff although i suppose it's possible given other strange things in my life that karla put in the same category and it was like an awakening for me,like yea, you're right, it has to be connected... i shoulda known before hearing her...then i met in dallas: t. good at cheyennne turners' meetings eclectic viewpoint and i offered to typeset for her...she told me that karla had talked with her (mufon director) and she was the lady in the introduction to karla's book...it's a trip isn't it? although i have very little to add after all my studies of ufos, i know something is out there, i don't know how people who have never seen one can believe. i suspect navy and i don't believe the et hypothesis is right, but that's about all the conclusion i have come up with. thanks for listening-sorry to go on so....& thanks for your hard work in the field. finally, officially recorded & reported!"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"all dark gray w/buble; 2 feet approx; intricate on bottom; no lights/sound","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/30/1964 02:00 UTC"}
