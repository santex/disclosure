Sort of hovering and slowly changing position with one another. I watched for a few minutes then walked towards them as they dimmed to nothing one by one. A minute later, one plane flew through the area then one more followed in a different direction but through the same area, followed by one more from yet a different direction but through the same area. It is hard to describe but I would be able to draw what happened or be able to describe the event with objects in hand. There Is a ton of activity over my city almost nightly and have had a close encounter 2 different times but this is actually something I have never seen before. The sky was so clear that anyone looking up for more than a few seconds would have seen it. I know somebody had to report this event along with me. Could someone let me know?"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.609399","City":"Gladstone","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Gladstone","There were no other sightings in Gladstone on or around August 3rd 2012"],"Country":"United States"}
