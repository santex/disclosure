The light was very distinct and vivid against the clear blue sky and no more than a mile away. It appeared to be hovering or just stationary. There was no movement for at least 4 to 5 minutes before it accelerated incredibly fast to the south, where it suddenly made a 45 degree turn toward the east. It disappeared below the horizon. The light was constant, there was no flashing or change of color. I will be real surprised if no one else saw this event. There was heavy traffic on the highway and a busy airport in the vicinity. I do not know what it was"],"City":"Louisville","Object Shape":"Sphere","Region":"Kentucky","Summary":"White light object appears in the sky and speeds away.","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.261465,+-85.756056(14710)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14710) map </A>","Latitude":"38.261465","Date of the Event":"12/31/2008 04:30 UTC"}
