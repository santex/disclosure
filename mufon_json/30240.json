(i've had sightings before where i found blinking to be a problem in tracking the ufo, so now, i just try not to blink!);) literally, one second it was there and the next it was gone. there was no streak of light or any kind of trail. we watched the sky for a while after, seeing if it would appear again, but it didn't. a neighbor, across the street came bursting out his front door with his dog, looked up at the sky, and ran back inside. i'm pretty sure he saw the light from the back of his house, and came out front when he lost it. no one takes their dog out for a 3 second walk. if i talk to him tomorrow i will urge him to make his own report. as far as how i (and my mother) felt, i can only say that it was the same as our previous sightings. that is to say that we both had the feeling of it noticing that we noticed it. this time, it seemed like our seeing it made it flee, like it didn't want to be seen. this frustrates me, though, because i've seen \"lights\" through the course of my life. now, i want to see a whole ship! i guess i kinda feel like, if i don't see the outline of a ship, i can't be absolutely certain of what i saw. i know there are probably a million explanations for what i saw tonight that i haven't already thought of, but it was weird. and after hearing of other people's sightings, i feel kinda cheated that all i get to see are lights! that's how i feel, anyway. my mom described the whole thing as \"high strangeness.\""],"Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Washington","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"30240","Date Submitted":"07/18/2011 03:58 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"07/17/2011 10:20 UTC","City":"Spokane","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Latitude":"47.66157","Tags":"City","Summary":"Red Spherical Object in Night Sky","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Spokane","There were no other sightings in Spokane on or around July 17th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-07182011-0005","Longitude":"-117.422417"}
