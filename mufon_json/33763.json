Noticed a strait line of red-orange pulsating spheres traveling from the west to east. They moved slower than an airplane would. The lights did not blink like a plane.. No white lights at all. I ran to the front of the house to see how they traveled and counted 8 and there may have been more.. I ran to the front door to get my daughter so she could witness. By the time she came out she only saw about 4 of them. They just traveled until out of view. It was truly the strangest thing that either one of us have ever witnessed. I am 55 and have been around watching stars and planes at night for a long time and have never seen anything like this before."],"City":"Morganton","Longitude":"-81.681489","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"8-10 red orange pulsating spheres traveled in strait line above tree line approx 1mi away.
