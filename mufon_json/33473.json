I was in flight 053 BKK to TEH, a few minutes after take off I noticed a trianglular shaped object flying in opposite direction. It's shape could be recognized just by three red lights located apart. At first, I assumed it was an aircraft but as our plain increased its altitude the flying object got more definable by city lights coming into context. It was totally transparent hence I could see city lights through it. This object could only be detected by presence of those three red lights."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33473.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33473.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"33473","Summary":"Triangle UFO Above Bangkok","Log Number":"TH-11192011-0008","Date Submitted":"11/19/2011 05:09 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/10/2011 11:30 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bangkok","There were no other sightings in Bangkok on or around November 10th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"13.728879"}
