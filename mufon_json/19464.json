By the way this night is clear, no clouds at all. It was the most wierd thing I have ever seen. It was huge and at the top of the pyramid, there was a bright light. The light was extremely white. someone else brought up that it looked like the pyramid hotel in vegas but over long island sound. It lasted for about a minute then faded away. This may sound stupid, but if you saw it, you would have been amazed. I have never seen anything like this in my life, and if anybody can explain this I would love to hear about it. even our friend Becky who was driving to the party on interstate 95 saw the thing. When it appeared there was regular aircraft traffic over LI sound heading towards NY city but this was no airplane. Again it was a huge cloud like triangle with a white bright beacon on the top. someone please explain this to me."],"Date Submitted":"09/20/2009 12:52 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19464.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19464.html"],"Latitude":"41.284183","Longitude":"-72.525587","Log Number":"US-09202009-0004","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.284183,+-72.525587(19464)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19464) map </A>","Summary":"Large triangle.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
