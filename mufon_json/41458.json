I have been observing the sky for several years and had this been there before would have seen it. I saw what appeared to be a dome shaped object with what appears to be a window across one side so I retreived my camera and hooked it to the scope and took several pictures from around 10:30pm july 30 2012 to 1:00 am july 31 2012. I then went back out at around the same time august 1 2012 and took pictures of the same area and the object is gone. This thing would have to be miles wide to show up on a 5 inch reflector telescope and it appears to be sitting in a crater and then the crater is empty a day later."],"Log Number":"US-08052012-0021","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
