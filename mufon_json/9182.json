I live approx 100 miles southeast of Stephenville. My wife is a smoker and we do not smoke in the house, she was therefore sitting in the front yard in an auto smoking listening to the radio. When the object passed the signal from the radio station went dead. She states it lit up the sky brightly even before becoming visible, she exited the vehicle and observed what she describes a low altitude comet, or fireball with a tail passing overhead. She came inside and told me what she had observed and we dismissed untill the sighting reports the next day, the time of the event was not noted by us so it is strictly an estimate."]}
