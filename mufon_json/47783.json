I am filling in this report on behalf the witnesses that I interviewed, as requested by Morgan Beall. This was a sighting made by two adult persons (male and female). He went out to the front garden to smoke, and saw 6 stationary objects on the SE. The objects began moving forward one by one, leaving a perfect distance between them. They crossed over the sky almost over him and they eventually disappeared one by one. Even though their lights went off, they could still see the dark shape of the object as they keep on moving forward, never changing direction, until they vanished behind the trees and buildings in the area. The witnesses claimed the shape of the objects were clearer through his binoculars than through his video camera (see video and drawings attached)."],"Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City"}
