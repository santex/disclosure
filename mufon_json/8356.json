The lights were all white and in a strict V formation - very different than a typical airplane's lights. The object looked very large and moved at a high rate of speed. It was very high up and vanished after 6-8 seconds as it passed behind a street light and could no longer be seen. Very unusual and memorable event - I hope others that may have seen this will report their sitings here."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"11/13/2007 11:45 UTC","Case Number":"8356","Country":"United States"}
