Myself and another witness noticed two very bright star like objects above the horizon, south and west of Sherman, I could not tell how far away they were, could have been many miles. They were too bright and too large to be stars, and they slowly moved apart from eachother over a period of about 5 minutes. The brighter of the two suddenly vanished. 2 minutes later the dimmer of the two vanished as well. They were not aircraft, but there was an aircraft in the area during the time of the sighting. I have no idea what we witnessed, I'm not claiming that they were spaceships or anything like that, just hoping someone can shed some light on what we possibly saw."],"Region":"Texas","Summary":"2 star-like objects, Slowly moving, Suddenly Vanish","Date of the Event":"09/09/2011 08:30 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"31700","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.642902,+-96.59989(31700)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31700) map </A>","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Sherman","There were no other sightings in Sherman on or around September 9th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-09102011-0013","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Sherman","Date Submitted":"09/10/2011 04:35 UTC","Tags":"City"}
