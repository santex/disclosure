Calling myattention to them, we observed the objects move at a high rate of speed fromsouthwest to northeast maintaining formation throughout. The lead object was ata slightly lower altitude (estimated to be about 1-2 thousand feet, andmaintained a lead of about 1-2 thousand feet throughout the sighting. Theobjects made no sound whatsoever.
