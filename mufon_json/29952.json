The second one came like a half hour later I showed my husband and we followed it thru the skies for a while until it disappeared and then a third one came thru like twenty minutes later or so.We could not figure out what the objects were. Then like an hour later there were two fly almost side by side. I called a neighbor to witness this and he said they were watching it from their back yard. When we were watching them it lasted for like five minutes maybe a little longer and then they just vanished into the sky. The neighbor, my husband and I all seen them."],"Longitude":"-87.763096"}
