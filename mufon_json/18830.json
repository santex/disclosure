So i went and got my binochlears and i swear it was a flying saucer! At first i just couldnt believe it. It just hovered and kept on slowly moving. I felt like the cartoon where its eyes pop out of the other end of the binochlears. It was amazing. Eventually it was so far away i couldnt see the black dot anymore so i went inside. it was pretty cool i got it on film."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"18830","Object Features":"Dome","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Lake Havasu City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.486201,+-114.319155(18830)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18830) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08232009-0007","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Lake Havasu City","There was one other sighting in Lake Havasu City on or around July 3rd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"34.486201","Date of the Event":"07/03/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18830.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18830.html"],"Longitude":"-114.319155","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"It was hovering over Lake Havasu."}
