The day was sunny and calm. I don't remember seeing any planes or helicopters or hearing any either. Today, on June 17, 2013, I was going through my photo gallery and I saw that in one of the pictures there appears to be two objects above a house roof. When I zoomed in, I couldn't identify either object. I think one might be a helicopter and the other is possibly a bird, but I'm not sure. A friend suggested that I submit the picture to an organization that might be able to sharpen the picture and bring out the details."],"Summary":"Two UFO's in Oregon?","Log Number":"US-06172013-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.810143,+-120.552531(48187)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48187) map </A>","Case Number":"48187","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48187.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48187.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","Object Features":"Dome, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.810143"}
