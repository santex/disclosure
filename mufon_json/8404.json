(the setting was 6mp on the photos.) this is not the original picture ��� it is an edited pic - my intials are embedded within the trunks of a few trees for claim. the original can be rendered to investigators ��� so long as i get credited for the original picture. (no color correction was used ��� the use of color correction adds some scale and interesting detail.) the shaded corners come from a defect of the camera ��� the shaded areas are from a screw on cylinder that comes attached to the camera. (it is supposed to reduce glare) my gps coordinates were within 2 tenths of a mile from 35��� 32.040n and 111��� 52.105w when the picture was taken ��� on the trailhead. (waas accuracy is +- 33 feet ��� i noticed that as an average when tracking on my hike.) the proximity of the sun was not in line with the anomaly ��� the moon was not visible for another 3 hours. (it ended up being a crescent viewed near middle the top of the mountain ��� some time later after i descended. the picture is provided for scale reference.) there are three pictures submitted total. the edited copy of the picture, a picture of the moon, and a picture taken 2 minutes after the edited picture ��� this is to prove i did not have a spec of dirt on the lens. the protective lens cover was replaced after every set of pictures taken. at no point ��� was the lens off the camera between pictures or before pictures. i have full confidence in my camera and have used it a lot over the past few years. it is old and there have been times i have have a fouled lens. this picture does not exhibit any similarity to what i have seen when my lens is fouled. unfortunately - i did not actually see the ufo. i was looking for scenes - not ufo's. (i am sure it would have been barely visible - i have pretty sharp non-corrected vision.)"],"Date Submitted":"11/15/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/15/2007 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Flagstaff","There were no other sightings in Flagstaff on or around November 15th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.204052,+-111.636089(8404)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8404) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-111.636089","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-11192007-0005","Object Features":"Unknown"}
