The object appeared out of nowhere and had No sound. From underneath, the object had Red lights in a U shape or boomerang shape. The lights were all connected, there was no seperation in the lighting. A brilliant beam of white light was shown down on us and I felt stunned or paralyzed, I could not run away. The light was extreamly bright and did not resemble a spot light from a helicopter. It was steady and and did not move around, it was directly on us. Time became distorted and I do not know how long the incident lasted. At some point it ended and we went to our tents disoriented and stunned. We all knew something strange had happened but it was as if we were unable to talk about it. To this day I do not know if this was a UFO or an experimental aircraft but I do know that what I saw was real."],"Log Number":"US-08152007-0002","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date of the Event":"09/15/1977 01:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/15/1977 01:00 UTC","Latitude":"39.16761","City":"Dover, DE","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7679.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7679.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.16761,+-75.620809(7679)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7679) map </A>","Summary":"Large UFO with Boomerang shaped Red Lights","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
