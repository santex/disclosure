I���m an amateur astronomer and I was in my yard setting up my telescope for an evening of CCD imaging. As my telescope was going through the alignment procedures, I began to look to the sky and watch for satellites passing by. The early evening is usually a good time for that. O���Hare airport is directly to the southwest of my position about 2-3 miles. I noticed an aircraft climbing out and heading directly from the airport flying toward the northeast. Living close to the city, city lights reflect off the ���belly��� of aircraft and give them an interesting glow. I was just watching the plane fly by and I followed it as it passed and headed off to the northeast. At that time I saw something coming from the exact direction that initially I thought was another plane coming from the northeast, but at a much lower altitude and heading directly toward the airport to the southwest. I immediately thought this was odd and I began trying to identify it for several reasons. 1. Absolutely no lights 2. No aircraft flying to the airport would arrive inbound directly under the same path of the aircraft I just saw departing. 3. ���If��� it was an inbound plane, it was not on a ���normal��� final approach course to the airport. 4. It was completely silent. 5. The size and shape was odd. As the object came over the top of me, I noticed the reflection of the ground lights off the bottom of it. It appeared to be of a metallic structure. I kept trying to identify it. It appeared to have a winged or boomerang shape to it. I���d guess the altitude to be 300������500��� above ground level. It was moving on a straight and steady course at an estimated speed of 150 mph ��� 200 mph. It moved by fairly quickly, so I didn���t have a lot of time to study it. I���d also estimate the size to be about the size of a 737 or possibly smaller commuter regional jet type. I questioned myself that it might be a bird and I may have misjudged the size, altitude, and speed. But if it was a bird, it was well above my 75��� tree and would have been the largest bird I���ve ever seen even if I misjudged it. Even the largest bird I���ve seen in my area, a turkey vulture with a 6��� wing span, wouldn���t even be close to the size even if I misjudged the altitude. Also, it had a metallic reflective nature to it. I also thought��� well��� may be it was some type of balloon or a group of balloons tied together. Nope, the winds that night were from the southwest and it would be been flying directly in headwind. Again, the silence of it was very strange for the size and speed of movement. It just continued in the same direction to the airport with no change in speed or direction and I lost sight as it went behind the tree line. I was curious if anyone else had seen anything strange that night. I did notice that about 4-5 minutes after it past, some aircraft were flying in a ���non-standard��� pattern as though they had a missed approach. I was curious if the airport had any ���strange��� disruptions that evening around 7:50pm??? I was a commercial pilot for a long time, an avid amateur astronomer, my BS degree is in Aerospace Science, but this was one of the strangest things I���ve seen."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Object flew overhead, silent and no lights.","Latitude":"42.011141"}
