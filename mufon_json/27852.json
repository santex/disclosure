My mate and I went around the back outside to collect our bikes to ride home. Before heading off we were talking about plans for the weekend. While talking I noticed the moon in front of me. I was looking up at a 65 degree angle and marvelling at how bright it was. Hold a tennis ball at arms length to get an idea the size it looked to me. It was around 20 minutes later when I told my friend to turn around and look at the moon. I said ���I can't believe how bright the moon is tonight; check it out\" He just kept looking at me with a smirk. I told him again and his reaction never changed. So I asked him ���what's the matter, why won't you take a look���. He laughed and said \"the moon is behind you, idiot\". I slowly turned around and there it was the moon. To say I was in shock is an understatement. Even before I turned around to fiercely gaze at what I thought was the moon, a rush of thoughts when through me, like what the hell is that thing if not the moon? I turned around and yelled to my mate\" turn around now and have a look at this thing behind you. He thought I was playing games or something because he refused to take a look behind. I was absolutely frantic telling this guy to turn around and look at this thing. I closed the gap between us and grabbed his shoulder to force him to take a look. And just like good old Murphy���s Law the object blinked out just as he was turning to look. The object blinked out but it didn't just disappear. It was still there blended almost entirely with the darkness. The sky was black, no clouds and full of stars. This object which I now know was an orb was exactly where it was before the light blinked out. After staring at it for 15 seconds the orb began to move laterally across the sky. Heading north at about 15 knots before I eventually lost sight of it. Because I am partially deaf I rely more on my eyes and naturally see more details because of my deafness. If I didn't look so hard for it after blinking out I would have simply thought it had just disappeared. Some facts- 1. I would say the orb was about 100ft from my position looking up at a 65 degree angle. 2. The orb's colour when lit up was the purest white I have ever seen. 3. The orb appeared to be a very dark grey when the light blinked out. 4. The only way to describe its appearance at this time, it looked like a rock in the sky. It didn't look as though it was floating but more of a fixture. And it moved at such a perfect lateral angle that one would think it was on a railway track 5. There was definitely no sound coming from its area of position - stationary or when moving. I told my friend that I just witnessed a UFO and he laughed at me. To my satisfaction dozens of people reported seeing a UFO that morning. This made it in the local newspaper, but only a small article. When I realized the object was not the moon, my first thought was it had to be a UFO. I know it wasn't a plane, helicopter, blimp, meteor, Venus, swamp gas, weather phenomena or mass hallucination. This was something so out of the ordinary for me that the only way to describe the feeling would be to see k9 walk up on stage and start singing Elvis Presley songs. It really blew me away and opened my mind to the possibilities of reality."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27852.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27852.html"],"Latitude":"-28.001171","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"153.428317","Case Number":"27852","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Chatting to a friend outside I realized after 20 minutes that the moon was in fact something out of this world","City":"Surfers Paradise","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"Australia","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-28.001171,+153.428317(27852)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27852) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
