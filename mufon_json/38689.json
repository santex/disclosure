I saw a large bright white light stationary in the sky, so bright it hurt my eyes to look at it. It would flash sometimes. I watched it for several minutes then the bright light shut off and it became dimmer and flew away to the left (West). At which point about five smaller lights came from behind tree line and followed in a straight line the same path.I kept watching until the the lights just disappeared and I couldn't see anything anymore. I thought there was no way it was an airplane. It was so low and very large and so bright. I couldn't make out the shape of it because all I could see was glowing light."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Stamping Ground","Summary":"Saw a large bright white light hovering, and five smaller lights."}
