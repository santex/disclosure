At first I thought it was an airplane just going by? I wasn���t able to see anything just by looking around trying to fine the airplane then another flash! As I���m looking at my video viewfinder I see more flashing lights some seem to be bigger than others not sure what���s going on. My video was set at 60 zoom looking at the Orion to the right upper area of the stars. Could the military testing nukes in outer space? Not sure maybe lots of colliding rocks exploding? It seem to be somewhat apart from each other that could be thousands of miles away?������.Anyone out there may no what this is or what could be going on���will try to down load the video it���s about 20 minutes long. Have lots of videos I just been holding back to see if any others had video the same thing������������.Mufon give me a call soon������."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.780261","Log Number":"US-06292013-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Other","Case Number":"48484","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.780261,+-119.410532(48484)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48484) map </A>"}
