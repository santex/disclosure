As we're looking my uncle says \"Look at how pretty those 2 planets are.\" As soon as I looked at them I noticed they were moving. They were both moving counter-clockwise following each other. When they stopped the were on the opposite sides of each other, when all of a sudden one of them flew off and just disappeared. The other stayed right where it was for about an hour and then just slowly flew away. We were both pretty amazed, though I had seen strange lights like this before."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/14/2008 06:40 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10282008-0036","Region":"Ohio","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
