We live south of Everett Boeing and there are all kinds of planes always flying by. I love to watch the sky, birds during the day and planes and then to see the stars at night. A smaller aircraft flew south with the typical noise and blinking lights, nothing unusual there. As it flew south and I started to lose sight of it I looked back above the house and noticed these shapes above me flying from north to south. 3 cigar shapes, connected by glowing pale white to bluish light, they were at a slight angle to each other, stacked at an angle makes more sense, there was a pulsating light going through each individual one. There was NO NOISE, none. They flew slower then the plane that had gone by, much slower and again no noise, I was able to watch them for 3 - 5 minutes and then lost sight of them. I almost cried it was so unreal to me to be seeing this."],"Summary":"3 cigar shaped, glowing with pulsating lights","Date of the Event":"11/09/2012 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/14/2012 11:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43914.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43914.html"],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Lynnwood","There were no other sightings in Lynnwood on or around November 9th 2012"],"Object Features":"None"}
