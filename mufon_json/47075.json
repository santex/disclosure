{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were sitting outside in the front porch of our house Watching a thunderstorm roll in. We heard a low flying plane. Got up from the porch to look at the plane, as the plane was flying by we were following it. I noticed a light appear out of the clouds in front of the plane. The plane veered left,it seemed to turn away from the object. We started looking at the light trying to figure out what it was. As it passed over our house, the object didnt make any type of noise. It was moving at a slow rate of speed. My wife was able to take 3 pictures of the object before it disappeared in the clouds. I have never seen anything like it before."],"Object Shape":"Cylinder, Fireball","Date of the Event":"04/29/2013 07:30 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.429262,+-98.491948(47075)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47075) map </A>","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There was one other sighting in San Antonio on or around April 29th 2013"],"Summary":"looking at storm in sky, watching low flying plane.light appeared infront of plane.","Date Submitted":"04/29/2013 11:16 UTC","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04292013-0015","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"47075","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47075.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47075.html"],"Region":"Texas","Latitude":"29.429262","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-98.491948","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"San Antonio"}
