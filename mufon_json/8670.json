{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving on a country road west of Ft Scott, Ks. late eve-stopped at stop sign-this big thing ( it was so bright I couldn`t see the shape) with blinding lights stopped in front of us about 30 ft. in the air -it hovered there for a few seconds, for a bit I couldn`t do anything-I seemed frozen. And then just went up in the air and was gone in a split second. It made no sound. I was so scared, my 12 year old daughter was sreaming for me to go home-I turned the truck around and headed home as fast as we could go. There was also a white pickup that pulled up to the intersection at the same time but they didn`t stop-just threw gravel and drove like crazy to get out of there. when I got home and walked in the door-my husband said I was white as a sheet. Very few people know about this-but I still get chills thinking sbout it."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.839763","Log Number":"US-12252007-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.839763,+-94.708295(8670)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8670) map </A>","Summary":"lights so bright they almost blinded us-stood still about 50 ft in sky","Date of the Event":"11/30/1982 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fort Scott","This sighting has been favorited 2 times."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/30/1982 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8670.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8670.html"],"Country":"United States","Region":"Kansas","Longitude":"-94.708295","Case Number":"8670","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Fort Scott"}
