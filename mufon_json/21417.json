It was up at an altitude that it could have been a jet however there was no jet stream and it is in the single digits degrees farenheit. It then appeared to turn and the light was no longer shining in my direction but I could see a craft of some sorts it was at a distance that the shape was undistinguishable, then all of a sudden I could no longer see it as if it just zoomed off, however there was no sign of a jet stream and it disappeard very suddenly. Five minutes later I see a jet heading in the direction the craft appeard to take off in and another five minutes later another jet heading in the same direction."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/09/2010 05:45 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Princeton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Princeton","Latitude":"45.569965","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21417.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21417.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"01/09/2010 03:55 UTC","Summary":"Bright light hovering that appeared to turn and disappear.","Longitude":"-93.581628","Region":"Minnesota","Case Number":"21417","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01092010-0011","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
