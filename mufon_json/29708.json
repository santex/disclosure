I was on the shore looking out across the water when I noticed a bright light low in the sky coming from the west end of the pond. I observed this light for no more than 3 or 4 min move in dead silence west to east, first it was moving in a straight line, but a little over half way across the pond it seemed to move up and down in a very odd manner as it continued to move east. It was at this point I knew that this wasn't any aircraft I have ever seen. The way it started moving up and down it seemed as though what ever was in control of this craft was not operating the way it should. I continued watching the craft until it disappeared behind the trees of the east shore on its way toward the Budweiser plant."],"Longitude":"-105.078733","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.59303,+-105.078733(29708)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29708) map </A>","Log Number":"US-06252011-0001","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Fort Collins","There were no other sightings in Fort Collins on or around June 24th 2011"]}
