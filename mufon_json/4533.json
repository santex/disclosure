{"Case Number":"4533","Log Number":"US-03102006-0003","Summary":"I was driving home from downtown San Antonio and witnessed a series of strange crafts fly around my vacinity for an hour or so while i was driving on Highway 281.","City":"San Antonio","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.430612,+-98.492128(4533)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4533) map </A>","Latitude":"29.430612","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn March 10, 2006 I was driving on Highway 281 at 12:30 A.M. past the Alamo Dome in downtown San Antonio when a large bright white light caught my eye ahead in the sky about 1-2 football fields high(the craft stayed about that far away the whole sighting). At first I thought it was a tower light or something like that but when I got closer to this object it eventually got right above my car in the middle of the highway. I then saw the bottom of the object. It was triangular in shape with red and blue lights on the three corners blinking. I watched it until I had passed it. Astonished and terrified, I decided to take the next turnaround and go back and see if what I saw was real or not. When I got back to the place of the first sighting, I no longer saw the craft in the middle of the road but instead I saw the object near the lookout tower on the opposite side of the highway to the right of the tower. I then decided to take the next turnaround and find a spot to park on the side of the road to get a better look. But when I got near the tower again on the highway there was a 2nd craft that was smaller and had red and orange lights as opposed to the red and blue lights of the larger craft. I should also note that every time I saw these things during the hour of my sighting the crafts top bright light kept turning on and off randomly. When I saw this second craft I got scared because it proceeded to come straight towards me. This smaller red and orange craft eventually went right over me like the larger one did before. This craft looked like the first one did, triangular in shape only with red and orange lights on the bottom at the three corners. It also had a top bright light as well. It passed me and went to the right of me on the highway and then immediately changed directions and joined the larger craft on the left side of me on the highway quite fast. At this point I was not about to pull over and stop as these things were just too close for comfort. I was shaking, I honestly don���t know hwy I was so scared. Instead I just kept taking turnarounds and went in circles about 3 times until they disappeared. I saw them going back and forth across Highway 281 every time I turned around. It is almost as if they were following me, playing some kind of game. It���s kind of egocentric of me to think that these things were there only for me but at the time is how I felt which is probably why I did not want to stop on the side of the road for a constant look at these things. When they were no longer to be seen I headed back to my original destination point, home. About 5-10 minutes later I was near the University of Incarnate Word still on Highway 281 when I saw the small red and orange craft yet again on my left side no less than a football field high. I could not believe that it was near me again. It proceeded to cross my path giving me another view of its bottom and headed to my right until I passed it up. So I took the next turnaround yet again and when I got back it was gone. I then went ahead and drove a few more minutes before taking the next turnaround to finally go home. But when I got back the larger blue and red craft had returned and was approaching my left side until it got right overhead of me again. This time however I saw a bright beam of light that looked like those airplane beams you see near an airport or major highway shoot out of the bottom of the craft and proceeded to point it EVRYWHERE. When I say everywhere I mean it pointed it at cars, buildings and houses nearby. The odd thing was it never once pointed it at me. At least I think, though now that I think about it when I saw the craft overhead the light was so bright I had to shield my eyes for a second so it might have shined it on me at once. It very much looked to me like it was searching for something. After it got done with the beam it went on its way to the right of me and I lost site of it when I got too far from it. I should note that when this happened i got the best close up side view of the larger craft. It looked like a disk from the side. I was scared enough that I went home. Before I got home however I saw the small red and orange craft again, flying over 281 and towards my neighborhood near Brook Hollow Blvd until I lost sight of it beyond the trees on the horizon. When i got home it was around 1:40 A.M. I hope to hear something of this strange occurence in the near future as i am confused to what those things were. Someone else had to of seen these things. They were just way too obvious and apparent. I ruled out airplanes and helicopters because of the shape and movement of these things plus the fact that there was absolutely no sound of engines. Definately the most bizare and scary moment of my life. I did not take any photos nor did i film it as i did not have such devices handy at the time. This is my story as best as i can describe it. Thank you for listening to my sighting."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4533.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4533.html"],"Longitude":"-98.492128","Date of the Event":"03/10/2006 12:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around March 10th 2006"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"03/10/2006 12:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
