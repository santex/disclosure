{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing outside and I saw in the sky a small orange spot. It flickered as a flame as it moved from one point in the sky to the other. It then flickered out. There was no associated sound that I as able to hear and there was no visible contrail. The best guess I could manage would be that it was the tailfire of a rocket. It was very strange. I also had my co-workers come out of the office and observe the object, which they did."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"01:30:28","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03202011-0002","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.783246","Object Shape":"Fireball","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.783246,+-79.927622(28318)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28318) map </A>","Region":"South Carolina","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-79.927622","Date of the Event":"03/21/2011 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28318.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28318.html"],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Charleston","There were no other sightings in Charleston on or around March 21st 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"28318","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Charleston","Summary":"orange round flame moved steadily across the sky at an even pace.","Date Submitted":"03/20/2011 01:47 UTC"}
