{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsSeveral of we children were outside on a hot summer's night back in 1968 when we saw lights coming from behind a hill. We watched as the object climbed from behind the hill, then hovered for several minutes on the side of the hill facing us. There was no noise. It then, slowly, made it's way back to the other side of the hill. We could see the lights flashing from the hilltop. Then there was nothing...no lights, no sound..nothing. I might mention that there were no roads or houses on the other side of the hill. It was essentially wilderness area. It was like nothing I and the others had seen, and like nothing I've seen since. I recently asked a lady who was one of the ones who witnessed what we saw that night if she remembered it, and she did. \"At least I'm not going looney\" is what I thought when she said she remembered. That was over 40 years ago."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.486114,+-82.633789(27848)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27848) map </A>","Tags":"City","Region":"Kentucky","City":"Ashland","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Ashland","There were no other sightings in Ashland on or around July 10th 1968"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"27848","Latitude":"38.486114","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Diamond-shaped with rotating green, blue, and red lights at the bottom part of the diamond","Log Number":"US-02162011-0003","Longitude":"-82.633789","Object Shape":"Diamond","Date of the Event":"07/10/1968 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/16/2011 05:33 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27848.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27848.html"]}
