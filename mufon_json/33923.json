That's when i looked in the air and saw something hovering above my house. It was clearly a UFO because it was too close to be anything else. It was a coppery, golden color with flashing red lights. I felt priviledged that I was witnessing this rare event. Then my dog went around front and the UFO took it up through a beam and dropped it backed down about a half hour later. Weirdly my dog was completely unharmed and shortly after the UFO left leaving a tail as it flew away."],"Longitude":"-74.844601","Summary":"ufo flew in and hovered, then took livestock and left","Region":"New York","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.471745,+-74.844601(33923)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33923) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Latitude":"42.471745","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/09/2011 11:01 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33923.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33923.html"],"Object Features":"Dome, Insignia","Case Number":"33923","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"Davenport","Sighting Duration":"00:45:00","Date of the Event":"11/28/2011 04:26 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12092011-0004","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Country":"United States"}
