We first saw a very bright light hovering it seemed. So i ran inside and grabbed the camera. By this time it had gotten closer and was changing colours around the edge. It then ejected 3 smaller rounded objects which took off at such speed from it. It travelled probably a few kilometers and returned to the object that it had come from. Then it seemed to have just vanished. Never thought much about it as we have had synical responses from people. But i believe what i saw and photo graphed. These photographs were taken over the ocean on the eastern side of fraser island . I've unfortunatly lost the negatives and have just recently found the photos again. So i am hoping for some indentification to what i saw. Thankyou."],"Longitude":"152.923232","Log Number":"AU-01282013-0020","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-25.42922,+152.923232(45463)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45463) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45463.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45463.html"],"City":"River Heads","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Fireball, Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
