Enjoyed the partly sunny sky and mild weather after enduring several long days of rain. It was about 5:10pm when I placed the feeding bowls down for the dogs to begin eating. I made a quick call on the cell phone while remaining outside. As I hung up the phone I noted the time was 5:14pm and I casually looked towards the sky as I began to place the cellpnone in my pocket when something in the eastern sky caught my attention. First I thought it was a plane but the shape was something different from most planes I see in the sky. It had a shape that really wasn't round but not cigar or cylinderal either. Hard to really explain. It was moving southward and would move behind clouds and fading contrails. Remembering that my cell phone had a camera, I took it out of my pocket and tried to take a picture but never could zoom in close enough to get a good snap. I watched it for 30 to 45 seconds before my attention went back to the dogs."],"Log Number":"US-03152009-0014","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/15/2009 05:14 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.857338,+-86.564755(16035)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16035) map </A>","Summary":"Feeding dogs when casually looked up and saw object in the sky.","Case Number":"16035","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16035.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16035.html"]}
