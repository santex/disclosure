I marked the ground with my foot and looked to see what direction it was going I then ran in the house to get the camcorder. I went to the same spot that I made. It took a little bit to find but when I did and zoomed in it was clear that it was a black wing-boomerang shaped object. I watched it as it went in differnt directions and switched the camcorder in differant modes negative art ect. It also looks to have a glow around it."],"Latitude":"33.453577","Log Number":"US-02162011-0015","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There was one other sighting in Phoenix on or around April 1st 2002"]}
