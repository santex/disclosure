I noticed that the moon was bright and the sky was very clear at that time. I also noticed another bright object to the left of the moon (looking at the pic) and close, so when we went inside I used Droid sky view to see what it was, and I do not remember the name at this time, sorry. I took a picture as close as I could of both the moon and the other object together. It wasn't until 2 days later when I looked at the picture again that I noticed something to the right of the moon (if you are looking at the picture) and another 2 objects below the moon, one of them is a little above the 2 in 2013."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around October 22nd 2013"],"Longitude":"-74.003423","Case Number":"51809","City":"New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51809.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51809.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/22/2013 05:48 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.716413","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"New York","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
