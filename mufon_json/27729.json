One day, over breakfast, my grandmother told me of a light she had seen the night before. She had gotten up in the middle of the night and saw a ball of light descend and stop on top of the dome of Imam Reza shrine. She added that the light had lingered motionless over the dome for a period of time and then descended into the dome. She had watched for a while and then had gone back to bed. When I asked her what she thought it was, she said ���It must have been angel Gabriel coming to visit the Imam.��� To my recollection, my grandmother was not given to any particular religious sentiment and would have no reason to make such a story up. I believe she was simply using the only description that would make any sense based on the culture that she was in. If anything, she was very pragmatic and well focused on the business of day-to-day life. I have been meaning to write about this and other ���UFO��� experiences for a couple of months now. In light of the reports of 28 January, 2011 over Jerusalem, I feel it is important to post the above information."],"Longitude":"59.6","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"11/30/1965 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Light descending on Imam Reza Shrine","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mashhad","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"02/08/2011 06:35 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27729.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27729.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
