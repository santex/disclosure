I was looking up at the sky, I was remarking on how bright the stars were that night. We don't have any street lights in our development. Apparently we live near an observatory. There was a large bright light that shot across the sky to low to be a shooting star. The light shot through the clouds and then disappeared. The three of us looked at each other and in amazement we all said at the same time, what in the world was that. We all were scared. Needless to say we all felt uneasy. The object was traveling fast but not but slow enough to describe. I saw a tail on the end of it glowing blue light. This could be explained as allot of things, I figured I would let you people know about it. I don't expect this really has any weight to you guys. I thought I needed to share this you. I saw your program tonight I thought I would let you know."],"Longitude":"-112.429146","City":"Maricopa","Log Number":"US-04042006-0012","Region":"Arizona","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"4635","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4635.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4635.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/23/2005 06:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 33 other sightings in Maricopa","There were no other sightings in Maricopa on or around October 23rd 2005"],"Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"A bright light that shot accross the sky in the clouds."}
