I saw it at least a mile away just off the left side of the interstate about 300 feet in the air. As I got close to it, I could tell that it was not moving. So I figured it must be a helicopter. As I got next to the craft I could see the shape of the object and it looked like the stealth bommer, but it was not moving at all. Just hovering there. As I contunied down the interstate I lost sight of the object."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-01152008-0036","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
