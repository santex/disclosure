{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn January 15, 2012 1735 Hours, I was the passenger of a vehicle, driven by my General Manager. I was using night vision goggles to look at Mount Shasta as we were driving by this mountain. With the night vision goggles, I saw nothing spectacular. But, as I continued to look at the sky and the mountain, all of a sudden a globe shaped UFO descended from the sky, then it quickly ascended, then descended again and ascended one more time and blinked out. The UFO did a 'W' maneuver in the night sky. My General Manager who was driving did not see the UFO. I would estimate that the UFO was right near Mt. Shasta and we were approximately 30 miles away from the mountain and UFO."],"Log Number":"US-01182012-0013","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"34935","Date Submitted":"01/18/2012 05:26 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Egg","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34935.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34935.html"],"Latitude":"40.58911","Longitude":"-122.389035","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.58911,+-122.389035(34935)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34935) map </A>","Summary":"Globe shaped UFO descends, then ascends, then descends again and finally ascends and vanishes.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Redding","There were no other sightings in Redding on or around January 15th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"01/15/2012 05:35 UTC","Tags":"City","City":"Redding","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
