{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"51930","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 630pm, I was standing on my patio and saw a bright star like light to the sw of las vegas, thought it was Venus at first but it was bigger than seeing a star so I got my spotter scope and looked at it and saw a circle of lights with many lights in center connecting like a spider web floating like a leaf but whipping in the wind flipping and turning slowly over floating south west. I thought that it could not be a weather balloon because of all the lights. It was interesting and I have never seen any objects in the sky like this, we see planes flying all over the sky and a couple flew past this object, I wonder if any passengers saw it too. I lost sight of it as it got closer to the mountains and went behind the clouds southwest of Blue Diamond."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Other","Region":"Nevada","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-115.163746","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.120786,+-115.163746(51930)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51930) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10302013-0003","Date Submitted":"10/30/2013 07:20 UTC","Latitude":"36.120786","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51930.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51930_submitter_file1__1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51930_submitter_file2__2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51930_submitter_file3__3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/51930_submitter_file4__4.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51930.html"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Las Vegas","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around October 29th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/29/2013 06:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Summary":".Circle of lights floating like leaf in the wind over sw las vegas."}
