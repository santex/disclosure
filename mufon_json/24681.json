I saw 5 lights. They were gold in color. They were in a slight arc and angled at 45 degrees. The 3rd or 4th light went out and another light appeared at the bottom of the arc. At first I thought it was a plane, but I quickly saw that they were individual lights. I was driving and I pulled over. The five lights went out. Three lights reappeared in a different spot in the sky. They went out one by one. A single light appeared higher in the sky. I tried to video with my phone, but I have never used it before and could not get it to work in time. The entire event was 5 minutes or less. The lights were stationary. They did not appeat to move. There were a couple of vehicles that drove by, and I was astonished that they did not stop. The lights did not flicker. They just came on and went off like they were on a switch."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Other","Date of the Event":"07/19/2010 08:55 UTC","Tags":"City"}
