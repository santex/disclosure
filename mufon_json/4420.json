We looked at it through my binoculars. The best way to describe it is two burning gas vents coming off of a center mass. I have seen several UFO's from time to time but nothing like this. It took the object several minutes to move what looked like inches to us. It then began to get dimmer as it moved closer to the horizon. I have seen more than my share of meteors and satellites. There is no way that it was either of those two things."],"Log Number":"US-02122006-0001","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4420.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4420.html"],"Region":"Utah","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"two gas like vents making a v shape coming from a central core"}
