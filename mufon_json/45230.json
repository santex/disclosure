A star captured my attention when it grew brighter and then began to move straight up. It moved past several other stars and then faded rapidly until it disappeared. There were no clouds in the sky. Within seconds I counted 5 airplanes in the air that were not there before in all different parts of the sky. I was pretty excited about it and make a joke on facebook about the aliens coming to take me home ;)"],"Summary":"Object I thought was a star at first until it brightened and began to move straight up and then disappeared","Region":"Kentucky","Date of the Event":"01/03/2013 06:30 UTC"}
