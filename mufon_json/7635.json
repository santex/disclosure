If it were a military aircraft, I assume at these speeds it would have made a sonic boom, and it was very high up, as it resembled no more than a dark red dot (like a pimple) in the sky. I've seen another thing before, but not here. This looked like Mars was soaring through our atmosphere at Mach 3, in a straight line at a consistent speed. I saw it for about six seconds, and then it hit the cloud line, where it was no longer visible. I immediately called my friend, who had seen a more dramatic episode before, and he was happy to hear about it. No photos, video, etc. available. The time area is accurate, I just saw it and decided to report it. It seemed to be going north - west, from \"The Zone\" toward \"Texas State University Campus\". That's all!"],"Region":"Texas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.884545,+-97.934094(7635)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7635) map </A>"}
