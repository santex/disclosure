I continued to watch it as it flew over me toward the Northwest in a descending straight path at maybe a 15 m.p.h. pace. As it was getting closer as it was descending I observed what looked like a tubular triangle frame with what clearly looked like a fireball in the center as wide as the frame glowing in red, orange and yellow. There was not a whisper of sound. at first I thought it was a hot air balloon until I was able to see that there was no balloon or any type of basket attached. As the object was moving away it went over a tree line about 1500 ft. away from me. Then, it looked like it just dropped out of the sky and disappeared. I thought to myself as this was transpiring, Is this real?, Is this a UFO?. I Felt kind of excited about it at the same time feeling puzzled as 64 thousand question go through my mind."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Attleboro","Summary":"Triangle shaped ufo with fireball in center","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49266.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49266.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.910823","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-71.263791","Case Number":"49266","Log Number":"US-07282013-0026","Region":"Massachusetts"}
