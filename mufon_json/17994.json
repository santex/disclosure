I do!!! All mankind has to do is learn to live in peace, that would be the first step to knowing more about them.OK, so much for my thoughts, I watched it slowly fade from sight to the east."],"Date of the Event":"07/09/2009 09:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Summary":"I walked out of my back door,Looked up and saw this object moving across the sky","City":"Marinette","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/09/2009 09:20 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.102835,+-87.623292(17994)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17994) map </A>","Region":"Wisconsin","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"45.102835","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Marinette","There were no other sightings in Marinette on or around July 9th 2009"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17994.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17994.html"]}
