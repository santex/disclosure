It did seem to rotate...... We saw it for about 20 minutes, but it could have been there longer. When it disappeared it was just gone from one minute to the next. I would appreciate if you would let me know what you think it was.... We were on our porch, at first I thought it was a bright star, but then I decided it was WAY to big for a star, so we got the video camera. My husband did nothing to the video except zoom in on the images.
