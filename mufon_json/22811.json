If one solid object, lights would have formed a massive boomerang shape. Could not see any solid object between lights. Object was moving slowly and silently in a slight bank. Unable to ascertain distance, speed, or exact size but appeared to be very large. Object was moving from the north. Object vanished after about a minute (all lights went out). I have lived near airports all my life and am very acquainted with all aircraft - this was not any aircraft I have ever seen or heard of. Seemed very similar to the Phoenix Lights."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.548944,+-112.464862(22811)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22811) map </A>","City":"Prescott"}
