It was blunted at one end and looked like it was galvanized gray metal. Absolutely silent it flew underneath our yard light approximately 10 feet off the ground from east to west in a straight line. I could see it clearly. I saw no evidence of a neck and head nor feet. I'm saying that it wasn't a bird as I saw no wings either. I watched it for about 40-50 feet as it entered my peripheral vision on the right then saw it clearly as I tracked it when it was directly in front of me until it was lost to view behind our pine tree, a distance of approximately 20 feet. The entire sighting lasted about 2-3 seconds, not really long enough to make out great detail. I'm just sure that it wasn't a bird and that whatever it was it was moving fast. It was about that time when our neighbor's dog to the west started barking wildly too."],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"08/14/2009 10:00 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-85.597664","Summary":"Streaked gray.
