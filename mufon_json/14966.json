Vacationing just taking some pictures,took this shot of the harbor of a passenger ship. Now I did not see anything out of the usual. Were we got back I looked at all the pictures, saw these lights and though I might have something. Well I let it go till now I went though them again and blew this one way up. I would like for you to take a look at the left hand corner and see if you see what looks like a ufo? I did not mean to let this go for so long,but life gets in the way. Please let me know what you think. This picture has not in anyway been touched up. {pid}"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.327831","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.61161,+-122.327831(14966)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14966) map </A>","Latitude":"47.61161","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"I did not see anything!","Log Number":"US-01172009-0011","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Case Number":"14966","City":"Seattle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14966.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14966_submitter_file1__TheUFOPICT.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14966.html"],"Region":"Washington","trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There were no other sightings in Seattle on or around March 13th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"03/13/2008 04:38 UTC"}
