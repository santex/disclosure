The time was approx 9:45 PM. We were headed North on a road that we aren't sure what it was as we are not that familiar with Greentown. We noticed a large, low, orange light hanging stationary in the NE sky. (NE of Greentown) Then it began to move slowly from NW to SE in the sky. It was definately NOT a part of the fireworks. We continued to watch it until we couldn't see it anymore due to our driving and its moving away from us"],"Region":"Indiana","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18243.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18243.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.478094,+-85.966653(18243)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18243) map </A>","Longitude":"-85.966653","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Greentown","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
