We left at 5:10 pm January 17, 2013. I had a window seat so i was snapping photos of the sunset, was very beautiful scenery. I snapped quite a few random pics, not really paying attention to what was in the photos. I was just trying to capture different angles of the horizon. Few hours in the flight i looked through the photos on my digital cam and originally thought this was part of the little or big dipper, not thinking into it too much. When i arrived home and looked at the photo my laptop, i realized there are not any other stars in the pic and those lights are not in any other photos. I am not sure if these are satellites orbiting the earth or if there is another explanation for these lights."],"Date of the Event":"01/17/2013 05:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Salt Lake City","There was one other sighting in Salt Lake City on or around January 17th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Salt Lake City","Latitude":"40.763159","Date Submitted":"01/19/2013 12:02 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
