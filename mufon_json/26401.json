{"Log Number":"US-11062010-0011","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the deck of my childhood home, I was leaning back against the railing while gazing straight up at the stars. It was a very clear night, the Magellenics were quite visible. From my perspective, the point at the top of the roof of the house was just above my gaze (i.e., in the direction of my forehead in reference to the eyes) and dead-center in the middle of my field of view. A light emerged from over the top of the house at what seemed to be an extremely high altitude. It made no noise, so I thought it might be a satellite. But then a \"feeling\" of sorts came over me during which the thought went through my mind, \"You're going the wrong way - turn around!\" As if in response to the thought, the object did exactly that - just like a yo-you that never fully stops, it was going one direction one moment and the complete opposite direction the very next. It disappeared behind the top of the house from whence it came and I never saw it again (that I'm aware of)."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-78.92001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.328381,+-78.92001(26401)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26401) map </A>","Summary":"High, slow-moving - it seemed to hear and respond to my thoughts","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Pennsylvania","Latitude":"40.328381","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26401.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26401.html"],"Case Number":"26401","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Johnstown","There were no other sightings in Johnstown on or around September 1st 1992"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Johnstown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/01/1992 08:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/06/2010 08:03 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City"}
