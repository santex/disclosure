Saw 5 jets go flying over leaving contrails. So I grabbed my camera and went outside to see if there were any strange objects in the sky like there were yesterday. Noticed to the southeast of my viewing position a very bright, glowing object which did not appear to be moving. Took pic and watched it for about 2 additional minutes. 2 more jets came behind the other 5."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.017727"}
