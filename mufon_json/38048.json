They appeared to just be hovering for a moment. I pulled over our vehicle to see if I could tell what these tow things were. They were very different then all of the stars in the sky and did not move or have the lighting to make us believe that they were planes. Plus they were too close to be planes in formation and I've never seen planes with orange only lights. After a moment, we could see the items moving so we started driving and taking pictures and video of the items when a third orange ball appeared. They changed direction and started moving a bit faster. The third ball that appeared seemed to just disappear then a moment later another disappeared. The one that seemed to be leading the pack took the longest to disappear. It kinda just stopped moving then just disappeared as if someone just switched off the light."],"Date Submitted":"05/10/2012 12:46 UTC","Latitude":"32.549602","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Fireball","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City"}
