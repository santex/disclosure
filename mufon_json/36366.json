Looked and saw two figures standing next to my bed staring at me standing still.","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","divs":["Sighting Details1. In bed, i was getting a drink on my night cabinet. 2. i had white christmas lights around my room i slept with on. I noticed objects in the corner of my eye. Turned and saw them. 3. Aliens. 4. They were about five to six feet is my closest guess. Very huge heads and tiny chins. VERY long fingers. had a light silver body suit on. I could see details in the Alien that was closest to me bones of its neck. 5. I didnt feel right to react because my worst fear would be not being able to talk or get up from my bed and to be honest i was scared and surprised. When i noticed them i kept my eyes on them as they stared at me, and after atleast two min of making sure it was real, i turned around and fell back asleep. Im interested to know why ive seen them.. in my bedroom."],"Log Number":"US-03102012-0007","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/15/2011 02:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"03/10/2012 12:45 UTC","City":"HOLLAND","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
