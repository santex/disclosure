At first we thought that the objects were planes, but we noticed that the objects appeared to be engulfed in flames and both had tails. It was too bright to be a star and didnt move through the sky quickly like a comet. The orbs moved very slowly. One of the orbs hovered for about two minutes and only began moving once the other orb got next to it. They ascended into the sky until they were no longer visible."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"48001","Date of the Event":"06/09/2013 12:00 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Summary":"(GS) Observed two fiery orbs with trails.
