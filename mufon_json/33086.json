(lower than any plane i have seen travel or helicopter). after watching the object for several min, it has a very odd flight patter seeming to almost be traveling diagonally, and as it came closer to me it started pausing in the sky for a few min then continue its slow rate of speed to the southwest. when the object came closer to me i noticed it was flickering, kinda like if you were to stare at a star and see the atmospheric disturbance. witch lead me to believe this really might be a ufo, cause in order for it to have that flickering it would haft to be beyond our atmosphere. the object stopped once again so i went to go inside and grab my cell phone to see if i could record this object. so when i came back outside and the object was still there but had gotten a little bit dimmer, then as i tried to record the object it was pretty dim so my cell phone could not pick it up, so i just stood there and watched, and slowly started to just fade away, as though it was traveling away from us, and a few moments later the object was gone. i know what i saw, as i've said before i live next to the busiest airport in the world and i'm a persistent sky watcher, always looking at the night sky, this was nothing i have ever seen before. i also did scan the skies for other airplanes for a reference, which i did see sevral of them and they did not at all share any characteristics of the"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11022011-0027","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Bright orange colored orb traveling slow, with odd pauses and no sense of direction above western suburbs of chiago","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-88.026772","Viewing Distance":"N/A"}
