A starlike object brighter than polaris sighted next to the moon and I watched in awe as it steadily and silently descended down horzion until it was gone","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was going outside to get the mail. From the moment I opened the door I noticed a magnificently bright star-like object on the left side of the moon. It caught my attention with its brilliantly bright white star like features. Immediately, I thought it was a star until it began to move. The object began to descend down the sky towards the horizon, fast, without speeding up or slowing down. I was thrilled watching it because I was skeptical that I would ever see one again. About half a minute passed as I followed its flight path until the light dimmed and was gone."],"Latitude":"34.050758","Country":"United States","Case Number":"34570","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Alpharetta","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Alpharetta","There were no other sightings in Alpharetta on or around January 3rd 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-84.259029","Date Submitted":"01/03/2012 08:19 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.050758,+-84.259029(34570)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34570) map </A>","Log Number":"US-01032012-0027","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:35","Date of the Event":"01/03/2012 06:55 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34570.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34570.html"],"Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
