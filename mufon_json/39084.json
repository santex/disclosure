Well they had to leave unexpectly and told us to relax and make out selves at home. While I was getting ready to lay down my phone accidentlally took a picture of the sky when I noticed what it was I stood up and took another pic in the same direction it revealed a trail of some sort. When I first saw the photos I didn't know what to think but there really wasn't anything to distort the pictures. It was about 2:00 in the afternoon and the sky was clear and it was very warm out. It looks like a blue orb of some sort. I did not see anything with my naked eye it was only visible via my pictures."],"Log Number":"US-06092012-0025","Region":"New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39084.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39084.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"My camera accidental snapped a picture in the sky and a blue orb was in the photo","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"39084","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Longitude":"-73.752132","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.656599,+-73.752132(39084)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39084) map </A>","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Albany","There were no other sightings in Albany on or around May 26th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"05/26/2012 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"42.656599","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Albany"}
