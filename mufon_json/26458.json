We ran out onto my deck and recorded what we saw on my cell phone. Sadly, my cell doesn't have a HDR video recorder so what I caught was one of the dots doesn't quite do it justice. I suppose It's better than nothing. The dots would spark up then vanish, they looked as if they were moving on the same parallel rail, back and forth. It went on for about 10 minutes but it was hard to catch them on film because they would fade in and out so fast. I have a full 5 minute version which you can hardly see anything, but, about a minute in you can see one we were able to catch on camera. I took the liberty of clipping the footage of just the UFO in case you didn't want to hear me and my friend banter about aliens for 5 minutes"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/09/2010 09:54 UTC","Region":"Maryland","Latitude":"39.299815","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26458.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26458.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","City":"Baltimore","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Log Number":"US-11092010-0007","Date of the Event":"11/01/2010 03:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"26458","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.299815,+-76.605329(26458)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26458) map </A>","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Diamond, Sphere, Star-like","Summary":"moving dots witnessed in MD sky daytime with video"}
