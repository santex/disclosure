It looked bigger than the planet which is visable almost daily in the night sky. I first thought that it was a plane but there was no sound or gas trail. It moved towards the right from the moon. It's movement was steady in a straight but sightly curved line for about a minute with glowing amber light. It dipped slightly with a wobbled for about 2 seconds and started gaining speed upwards before disappearing into the sky and was not visable. I's flight pattern was not a all like a plane either. It's not a commet for there were no tail it was'nt a shooting star either. Please verify if this is a ufo or not."],"Longitude":"101.613804","Latitude":"3.013086","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Cross, Star-like","City":"Puchong","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Selangor","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
