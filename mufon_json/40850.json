I pointed up in the trees and said what's that? It was a group of three lights moving slowly over the horizon still in the trees. I moved over in our yard to a clearing to see the lights better. At first it looked like the Chinese lanterns used during the fourth of July, but the stayed in a triangular shape with a slight variance to sphere or domed shape. It continued to move across the horizon and slowly ascended and moved back away from us and then dimmed out and was gone. This took about five minutes of time. My daughter was able to capture some of the lights on her iPad. My wife and daughter also saw the same lights hovering over the tree tops near the KC Royals stadium in November last year."],"Object Features":"Dome, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","City":"Blue Springs","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40850.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40850.html"],"trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Blue Springs","There were 3 other sightings in Blue Springs on or around July 14th 2012"],"Summary":"3 lights in a triangular shape that pulsated with slight color changes.","Case Number":"40850","Date Submitted":"07/16/2012 12:41 UTC"}
