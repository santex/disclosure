{"divs":["Sighting DetailsStepped outside for minute to feed some feral cats and noticed a very bright orange light to the east just above the horizon, probably a few miles away. It was moving pretty slow towards the north, and I notice a plane with flashing lights flying less than a mile behind it. It slowly faded out, took about 10 seconds to completely disappear from sight. I also notice another plane flying from the west towards it."],"Log Number":"US-10082010-0002","Date of the Event":"10/07/2010 11:00 UTC","Region":"New Mexico","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-103.13255","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Bright orange light, slowly faded out","Case Number":"25734","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.707982,+-103.13255(25734)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25734) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25734.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25734.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"10/08/2010 01:27 UTC","City":"Hobbs","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Hobbs","There were no other sightings in Hobbs on or around October 7th 2010"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"32.707982"}
