{"divs":["sighting detailswas outside and looking up at the stars i noticed something that looked like a star was actually moving from north\\east to south\\west. there were no blinking lights that i could see, and the object was going in a straight line but kind of slithering in a right left motion. about 10 to 15 seconds after the object moved overhead, i saw a burst of light that went from west to east (the objest going north to south)that burst lasted about 3 seconds. i followed the object as far as i could see it then it faded out of sight. it did not go out of sight like a plane would, it just seemed to fade. the sky was very clear and i could see the big and litter dipper's. i have reported to you several times about seeing objects, but i still get kind of excited when i see a new one."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-10312008-0022","Date Submitted":"10/31/2008 05:30 UTC","Region":"New York","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-73.238685","Summary":"Witnessed an object crossing the night sky","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Bay Shore","There were no other sightings in Bay Shore on or around October 31st 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"10/31/2008 05:30 UTC","Case Number":"13445","Latitude":"40.726589","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.726589,+-73.238685(13445)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13445) map </A>","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13445.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13445.html"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Bay Shore","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
