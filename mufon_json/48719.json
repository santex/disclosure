{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I was taking a walk in Holiday, Fl on July 5,2013, It was before 10pm. when we saw an very bright orange fireball in the sky coming from the east. At first I thought it was a big fire work, but it just kept on going over our heads. We notice it had an irregular shape and it was flying very fast, coming from the east going to the north west, headed to the Gulf of Mexico. We also noticed it didn't make a sound. We lost sight of it when it went over the tree line. We tried taking a picture of it with our cell phone but it didn't come out very well."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.199779,+-82.748394(48719)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48719) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Florida","Case Number":"48719","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Holiday","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/06/2013 01:57 UTC","Longitude":"-82.748394","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48719.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48719.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/05/2013 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07062013-0006","Country":"United States","Latitude":"28.199779","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"We saw an orange fireball in an irregular shape flying overhead going very fast, It didn't make any sounds, It was headed to the gulf of mexico.
