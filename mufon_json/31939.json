At first i thought Birds. But they were moveing too fast. No flapping wings, No lights no sound. They appeared grey in color and it looked blury around them. They were similar in shape to the stealth bomber. I grew up in the military and have been around every kind of aircraft made, flying or not. I live next to DFW airport also. Which makes this even more wierd. That many aircraft flying in DFW's airspace could not have gone unnoticed! I can not believe i am the only one to see this. Even at night they were in plain site. Flying north to south possibly below Radar."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09192011-0038","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Euless","There were no other sightings in Euless on or around September 19th 2011"],"Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31939.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31939.html"],"City":"Euless","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"12-15 v shaped aircraft no lights no sound flying in V shaped formation","Case Number":"31939"}
