I had just parked my vehicle and was walking towards the Observatory and decided to snap a few shots of the building. I didn't notice the object until I uploaded the pictures on my computer. That's when I noticed this odd shape in the sky in one of my pictures.I've posted two pictures. The first one is where the object is to the right of the screen. The second was taken about a min after from a different angle."]}
