I can see their trail clearly and suddenly I spotted a swarm of birds like things (18-25) flew west and they immediatley turn and flew east, as they turn east some grouped like a V shape like the birds fly while several flew themselves (about 80 dig north east). But the craziest thing about the whole thing was I never saw any wings flapping they were same exact color (whitish grey) and they were way higher up obve those air liners I was observing. Is it possible that these were birds? I could'nt find any type of birds that can fly that high on the internet. Can someone please expalin!"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
