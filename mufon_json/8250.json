It was a cool clear night (no visible coulds, high celings). Laguardia Airport is very close so there are always tons of airplanes landing and taking off all the time. I know what airplanes in the night sky look like. In any case I first noticed a huge contrail (my thought was, what kind of skywriting plane could have left somethign this big and long that's not dissapaiting?). Not 2 mins later, about a block from my house, i saw a HUGE bright light that seemed to be about a few miles away only just about the tree line. I watching for a bit, comparing and contrasing it against the obvious airplanes in the distance. It was VERY LOW, and VERY LARGE. It was so bright that it was easy to follow and seemed be either pulsing or rotating. The next thing i noticed was tehre was a SECOND ONE. The same size, a bit above and to the left of the other one. This one started to move laterally... not up or down but to the side -- very fast. It blinked out and there was just the 1 again. I watched for apprx 30 mins then tried to move my location to where there may be otehr people ro see if they were thinking the same thing. I got about a block away and it was gone. hairs were standing and i was scared. can't think of anything it could have been. also no sound."],"Summary":"2 Huge Lights Over Laguardia Airport, not airplanes, huge contrail preceding","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.762392","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.762392,+-73.930104(8250)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8250) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/29/2007 08:30 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/29/2007 08:30 UTC"}
