{"Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe had finished work at the Warrington Motor Lodge & Restaurant around 11 pm. Route 611 & Route 132 ( Street Rd ), NE corner We were in the back parking lot facing east when we saw an object to NNE moving slowly just above the tree line, it slowed & hovered then descended out of sight then in a few minutes ascended back up & moved away slowly. We were close enough to hear noise if it was a helicopter, but we heard nothing. Willow Grove NAS is several miles to the south so it was not associated to NAS at 11 pm We all said to each other that we just saw a UFO. My memory of the time line is unclear It could have been 1975 or 76 Were there any other reports in those years? It would have been in Warrington Twp."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-75.126854","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"an object appeared, descended & hovered in the distance before moving away","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Warrington","There were no other sightings in Warrington on or around May 31st 1976"],"Date of the Event":"05/31/1976 12:00 UTC","City":"Warrington","Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29407.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29407.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"40.250607","Date Submitted":"06/05/2011 09:39 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-06052011-0009","Case Number":"29407","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.250607,+-75.126854(29407)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29407) map </A>"}
