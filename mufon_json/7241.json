Once we got into the Village of Lyons, I happend to be doing something and something had told me to look up and I noticed a white circular object moving in circles then into an oval shaped. At first I didn't think nothing of it but as I had my eyes on it, I relaized that it happend to be a UFO. At first I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me but they weren't. I was very shocked at first then I became excited about it because it was my first time seeing one. At first, I had reason to believe that UFO's never exsisted but I was wrong. I don't have pics of it because I was about 14 years of age."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.946946","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.981977","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Lyons","Date Submitted":"09/17/1998 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States"}
