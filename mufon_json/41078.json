We were lying down getting ready to go to sleep. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a reddish-orange light. I turned my head and saw two reddish-orange orbs moving at a relatively steady medium rate in an arc across the sky. I had no idea what they were but I knew they were not planes. They made no sound and they did not blink. The event lasted approximately a minute or two. When I sat up to watch the orbs pass I alerted the person next to me. She saw the, midway through their arc and we both watched them until they passed over our roof. I was tired when I first spotted the objects but I immediately sat up in the tent. I was very curious and even though I didn't know what they were I was not scared. I was relieved that there was someone with me and that she saw the same thing."],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/22/2012 11:25 UTC","Summary":"Two reddish-orange spheres passed over us in an arc.","Longitude":"-70.874656","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.517492,+-70.874656(41078)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41078) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41078.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41078.html"],"Log Number":"US-07222012-0031","Region":"Massachusetts","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Salem","There were no other sightings in Salem on or around July 21st 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.517492","City":"Salem","Case Number":"41078"}
