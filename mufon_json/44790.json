I was wondering what they were looking at and I looked up and said oh its probably a helicoptor. Then watched it for a few mins longer to notice it was actual three different orbs that at first were one solid object and split off into three. I was cold and decided to go into the house and my husband came in and said that they seen more trail behind after a min and thought maybe they were Japanese lanterns. I thought no they wouldn't be up that high and we just left it at that."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-12262012-0001","City":"Comstock Park","Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"44790","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Country":"United States","Summary":"three bright orangish colored objects at first then more followed way behind","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-85.632118","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Comstock Park","There were no other sightings in Comstock Park on or around December 24th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.115614,+-85.632118(44790)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44790) map </A>","Region":"Michigan","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44790.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44790.html"]}
