I remember the date, because it was my last Christmas Eve in Puerto Rico, before enlisting in the U.S. Army. Christmas was the biggest holiday in my neighborhood, so it is hard to forget. I lived in the city of Aguadilla, on the northwest coast of Puerto Rico, in a residential complex, on a hill facing the Aguadilla bay, known as ���Cuesta Vieja���. It was some time between 6:30 and 7:30 PM. I had come outside, after getting ready for the festivities, and was talking to a friend, we were standing by the steps, leading to the playground, across from building #6 and behind building #11. (I lived just across, in building #6, second floor, apartment #75). At some point in our conversation, we looked up and noticed a star moving. At first, we thought it might be an aircraft, being that there is an airport on the north side of Aguadilla. But it was moving way too fast to be an aircraft. I mean, that thing moved from the equinox to the horizon in less than ten seconds. This moving object seem like a regular star or satellite to the naked eye. Seeing that it was moving so fast, we then assumed it might be some kind of satellite but then, it did something no satellite we had ever seen did; it stopped and started moving across the horizon, first to the left, then to the right at a very fast rate of speed. Then it returned to the middle and retraced its trajectory back to the original position on the equinox. Again, it started to move towards the horizon. At this point I remembered that my then, brother in-law was in my home so, I ran home and asked him to bring out his binoculars so we can get a better look at the ���UFO���. He immediately followed me outside. By then, there were other people outside looking at this UFO, some with binoculars and at least one telescope. I don���t remember who they all were, but I���m sure they were neighbors, some adults and some kids. The object was just above the horizon. When I finally got my chance to look through the binoculars, the object seemed to be the shape of an upside down saucer, it looked brightly illuminated with color lights that seem to be changing fast on its bottom half. It looked to me like the colors of the rainbow. The object was stationary for e few minutes, then moved to the left, then to the right, back to the center as before. This time as it moved toward the equinox, it started picking up speed. Once at the equinox, the object zip out of site at an amazing speed. Everyone that was there that evening got a chance to look through the various ocular devices and get a good look at the UFO. Even after all this years, I have not forgotten so, I am sure the others must remember also. I never reported it before, since I was joining the army and did not want to be labeled a ���nut���. Although, once during an interview for my security clearance, the investigating agent asked me if I had ever encountered a UFO. I related to him the facts as stated above, but added that I did not believe it to be of extraterrestrial origin. I told him, I imagine it was some kind of secret experimental craft. I now live in Morrow GA, and may be contacted at the number above. Last I heard, my friend works, or was working, at a restaurant ���Carr 107, Barrio Borinquen��� in Aguadilla, PR. My ex-brother-in-law, lives somewhere in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Since he and my sister divorced, we don���t keep in touch. During the two years preceding this incident, I had heard of other sightings by other kids at school and neighbors. I assumed they had mistaken the identity of some man-made aircraft and ruled out any other possibility. But, this incident made a believer out of me. I now know this was not a man-made object. At that time, the fastest thing in our air fleet was the SR-71. The way this thing moved, it can play loops around the SR-71. I have seen a lot of military planes and this thing is still the fastest thing I have ever seen. I believe, we are not alone in the universe. Keep getting the word out. People need to know these things. Yours Truly, Roberto Alago"],"City":"Aguadilla","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like"}
