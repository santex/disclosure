There was no motor sound even when the lights started moving faster. The lights would seem to go from four into two or one and then reappear. We both thought it could be our bad eyes or vapor in the air that made the lights seem to dance. We both knew we'd never seem something so odd in in the sky and it was eerie that there was no noise, especially after it seemed to accelerate and simply disappear before our very eyes."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"32.723599","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.723599,+-117.149255(29794)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29794) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29794.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29794.html"]}
