I have seen allot of things in the sky but I cannot explain what I saw. I was helping a friend move from his apartment in Katy, Texas. My wife, my friend, and I were in my friends mini-van on our way to his apartment. Being a pilot, I tend to pay attention to things I see in the sky. On this particular day I saw what I thought was a parachute jumper with an inflated canopy at a very high altitude. I was having trouble identifying the exact shape of what I was seeing. As I watched this, I was in a moving vehicle looking up through the windshield. As I watched, I noticed small white balls around the main object in question. I first thought it was parachute jumpers free falling around the parachute that was open but as I watched I noticed that they were not falling down but instead began to move from a stationary position to moving across the sky with some of them moving in different directions. The main object moved toward the northwest with the smaller whitish-silver balls remained relatively close to it, while several of the other white balls moved in different directions and eventually disappeared, but not over the horizon, I mean it disappeared before my eyes in the distance. I continued to watch the main object and the smaller ones as they moved faster. While I was watching my wife asked me what I was staring at and I told her I don't know. We all got out of the van and observed the objects for 20 minutes or more. There was no noise. If you didn't look up and see it you wouldn't even know it was there. It felt as though we were being watched and observed. We weren't scared but more curious and frustrated that we couldn't figure out what it was. After watching it disappears into the sky, NOT OVER THE HORIZON, almost like a shooting star but going into outer space vs. falling to the ground. We kept a vigil over the sky for the next couple of days and started researching it on the internet. What we found blew us away. It was exactly what we had seen yet it was seen all over the world. In Spain, Mexico, Germany, Peru and they recently had a sighting over San Diego on New Year���s Day. If you go to UFO Fleet with mother ship that is exactly what we saw. It was over Pecula, Mexico in 2006. I can tell you I can't explain it. It was definitely not balloons, paper lanterns, geese, fireworks, military aircraft, airplanes, hot air balloons, weather balloons or anything that I have ever seen."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"11/24/2007 03:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Longitude":"-95.823096","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Katy","There were no other sightings in Katy on or around November 24th 2007"],"Summary":"Saw what I thought was a parachute with white dots around it but dots and parachute never came down,","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"11/24/2007 03:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like"}
