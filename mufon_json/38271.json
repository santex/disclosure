So they must either be really slow learners or they are training every cop in the world because i hear and see them constantly training every night for almost a year now some 2-3 at once lasting threw till the next day actually i can hear 1 now so i guess there training hours have been extended .... right!"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.914694,+-78.870548(38271)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38271) map </A>","Case Number":"38271","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38271.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38271.html"],"City":"Oshawa","Date of the Event":"05/20/2012 02:33 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-78.870548","Region":"Ontario","Latitude":"43.914694","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like, Other, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"group of hovering stars all moving then a big flash as 1 appeared close to the earth then almost 300ft away it flashed again an traveld in a forward motion above me with blue red orb 300 ft in treeline","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Oshawa","There were no other sightings in Oshawa on or around May 20th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"01:01:00","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other,Unknown","Country":"Canada"}
