I then went in the house for a camera and woke my wife up and told her of my seeing the UFO. She too went out and also sighted the craft which was now in the NNW section and I got one picture of the craft but a second picture turned out really odd for my Kodak CX6330 camera."],"trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Sedona","There were no other sightings in Sedona on or around October 2nd 2013"],"Case Number":"51262","Longitude":"-111.765905","Summary":"My wife and I saw a cigar type craft in Sedona AZ","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cigar","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.792418,+-111.765905(51262)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51262) map </A>","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Arizona","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10022013-0007","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
