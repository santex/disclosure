The object went from the bottom to the top of the NASA TV picture. Right side of picture behind Noguchi as he was placing the inop gyro into the shuttle cargo bay. At approx 03:44 PDT or around 2 hours 4 +- 2or3min into the space walk. A small dark object visible for only 2-3 seconds. From the angle of the camera at the time the thing must have been going in the same direction as the shuttle. No way to tell range. If I hadn't been watching closely I would have missed it. Didn't look like a digital video artifact. Sure wish I had taped the walk.
