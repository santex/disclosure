It was about 7pm and my parents and I were walking to our car parked on the street. I was always looking at the stars and that night was no different. I saw what was a dull lite object moving very slowly almost right above me. As I stared at it I saw that it was boomerang shaped with lights along the edges. Maybe about 4 or 5 lights on each side. I told my parents and they were in the car already. Told me to get in the car and that was it. I don't think I have told many this story since but have recently started reading about UFO's. Found your website and reported it. The sighting has always been on my mind for all these years. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to finally tell someone that will listne."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.723293","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/03/2009 07:34 UTC","City":"New York","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"19786"}
