(we had just approached the wooden bridge and had a clear view of the river). the discs were in line, spaced equally apart, and moving silently over the river. at first, i thought they might be helicopters but they made no sound. they were approximately one hundred yards away. as they began to move out of view i drove quickly up the road and took a right on to ballfield rd (in wayland) thinking that i\\we could get a better look as they moved away. unfortunately we could not as the view of the river was blocked by trees. so, that ended our experience. we remain convinced that we saw three ufos that evening."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["there have been no other sightings in wayland\\sudbury","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.384659,+-71.418062(9806)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9806) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9806.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9806.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-71.418062","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.384659","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/30/1985 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"9806","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
