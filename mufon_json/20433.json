It was clear and dark. A very bright star-like shaped light appeared from the the tree line cruising very fast in a northerly direction. It instantly reversed direction and began moving south at a high rate of speed. As it changed direction, a second smaller and dimmer light appeared behind the larger light and followed it out of sight. I lost both lights in the tree line. I estimate its elevation at between 2,500 and 5,000 feet. The main object appeared as a solid, bright, white light, larger than any star. The second object looked more like a small star. Both objects seemed to be below typical cloud level, although there were no clouds in the sky at the time. The event lasted about 8 to 10 seconds and there were no sounds. I remained outside for about 30 minutes more but saw nothing else. My dog did not act abnormally, however a couple of other neighborhood dogs south of my residence were barking immediately following the event."]}
