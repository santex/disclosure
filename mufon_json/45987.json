I went in and told my wife to come out and look and grabbed my cell phone to take video, which I did and you can see 5 of the objects at this time. 4 together in a diamond pattern and one lagging far behind. I never saw anything like this here or anywhere before. I have owned this house for over 20 years, and I have seen planes travel by but never like this. These objects were close to each other and low. After traveling south for a few minutes, moving independently of each other, but staying in the same general formation, they faded out one at a time. The video shows them pulsating white and red, but they looked bright orange to me as I was watching them. I have the video on my phone and you can see the 5 objects well, but the phone says the file is to large to e-mail, so I do not know how to send it or attach it to anything, but I will not erase th video off my phone. I will try to send it to my e-mail when I run into someone who can show me how."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
