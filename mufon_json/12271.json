I went up to the radar dome to just observe. I was a medic and could move freely on the site. I think Art waqs also an air force medic? A guy writting backwords on a plastic board. bogies would pop co north of Hokkaido and they were placed on the plastic board. Planes were sent up to engage and the bogies would return to Sackland? One popped up and suddenly went sraight up at an estimated six thousand MPH. A machine called a high finder only went to 95 mi. or 95 thousand feet. The next morning at the mess hall I started talking about the incident, boy did they stop me from talking immediately. The radar people was de breafed after I had left and was warned not to talk about the incident. It has been on my mind a lot since then.
