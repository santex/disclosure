{"City":"Murfreesboro","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside finishing up a cigarette before heading inside to work,I looked up and seen a large black triangle with 3 lights one on each tip that did not flash nor blink. There was one red light in the center that would sort of go dim and then back on,like a dimmer switch does. There was no noise and it just glided over. I would have thought it was a stealth bomber,but after calling two near by air force bases today they confirmed there was no way it could have been a stealth,I guess they have good reason for knowing that. I'm not sure what this could have been...but I know what I seen!"],"Longitude":"-86.386822","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/30/2011 06:21 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Triangle shape 3 white lights on each tip and 1 red in center","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Murfreesboro","There were no other sightings in Murfreesboro on or around August 29th 2011"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"31327","Country":"United States","Latitude":"35.796606","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.796606,+-86.386822(31327)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31327) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08302011-0023","Region":"Tennessee","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31327.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"08/29/2011 10:10 UTC"}
