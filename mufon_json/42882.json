I heard some sort of fireworks to the south and was confused with it being the end of Sept. I looked out my back door (facing north) and saw a large orange ball in the northeast. I thought it must have been a firework, from what else I was hearing, but this was moving very slowly and deliberately. I thought airplane, but it was much too low and large, and was only the shape of a ball, not an airplane with small blinking lights. I kept waiting for it to explode into a firework display. When it didn't, and kept moving to the west, I knew something was strange. The object was starting to move behind the trees in my backyard, so I ran inside to get a phone-cam, and to go upstairs to the 2nd floor to get a better look. I thougt it might have been a meteor at this point, but there was no trail behind it. I tried taking video cam, but never really had the chance as I watched it. The object was not heading towards the ground, but instead up into the distance. It had moved to the west, but also \"away\". It moved outward into the distance until it was very small and kept heading out...eventually, it was gone. I felt that it has to have been something strange. A test launch? Not sure...."],"Summary":"Large almost fireball moves across sky and then out of sight into the sky","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Roseville","There were no other sightings in Roseville on or around September 28th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"09/29/2012 01:27 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.761114","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/28/2012 09:15 UTC","Longitude":"-121.282366","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","City":"Roseville"}
