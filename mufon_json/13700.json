Where were you and what were you doing at the time? 1. I was leaving work around 27 Aug 08 -12:25am- I was going home to evacuating from hurricane Gustav. 2. What made you first notice the object? I notice the object as I was at the top of the over pass going over Highway 45. The object was in the middle of my windshield. I slowed down a looked at this object- it was about 12 to 14 feet above Dixie Farm Rd. I looked for cables or something that it could be hanging from but nothing it was stationary in sky on its own. I drove under it and kept going. I looked in my rear view mirror and it was still there, I know, I was not the only one that saw this object. The sky was clear ������Blue Bird Day���, something came over me- I carry a camera with me all the time, which, I use with my job. It���s funny, I never thought about stopping and calling 911 or taking a photo of the object. 3. What did you think the object was when you first noticed it? When I first saw this object, it looked like a camera or scanner- the dark windows were the first that caught my eyes. I heard about UFO Probes before an when I got home I told my wife about what I saw and sky was so clear it would have made a great clear photo��� 4. Describe the object and its actions and motions. The object was stationary and didn���t move any direction. 5. Describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. Like I said up in paragraph --- I felt calm, and kept driving down the road. I don���t understand still to this day ���why I didn���t stop and took photos of this object that I saw get some witness. 6. How did you lose sight of the object? I lost sight of the object the last time; I saw it in my rear view mirror as I drove down the road. It���s funny; I kept thinking about it all the way home and never turned around and went back��� I saw this video the weekend after my sighting and the same probe showed up on this video."],"Case Number":"13700","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13700.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13700_submitter_file2__UFO-PROBEFBICSI1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13700_submitter_file3__UFO-PROBEFBICSI2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13700_submitter_file4__UFO-PROBEFBICSI3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13700_submitter_file5__ArialVeiwofDixieFarmRd..jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13700.html"],"Latitude":"31.977519","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.977519,+-99.895103(13700)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13700) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"08/27/2008 12:20 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None"}
