I WAS HEADED UP interstate 5 going north and I was aproximently 8 miles south of weed Calif. The aproximent time was 1130 pm. I am cruseing 65 miles per hour and I am all alone, and I look to my left to see a greenish ball with a red tail of fire comeing in at what looked like a slight angle It looked to be at about 3000 ft high and It looked to be as big as two 747s. At first I thought it was a comet but it was comeing in to slow and I remember thinking to myself when that thing crashes I might be to close. but then it seemed to slow even more and go behind the mountain as if it was being controled. I waited to see if there was a crash but there never was. The entire event took 30 seconds but it was amazeing and I shall never forget it as long as I live. I read that there is a base inside mount shasta and that sighting confirms it for me. sincerely David Ericson"],"Object Features":"Other","Region":"California","Summary":"UFO comes in from the west flies behind Mount Shasta.","Latitude":"41.42785","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.380557","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Weed","There were no other sightings in Weed on or around September 15th 2007"],"Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"09/15/2007 11:30 UTC"}
