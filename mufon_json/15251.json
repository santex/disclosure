Just before 2100, I was on my way out to the garage in back of the house to retrieve some items from my car. I left through the back door and began crossing the backyard. Looking up in the sky, I saw movement of lights. There were 3 small spherical, orange lights moving briskly from east to west across the sky. They were in constant reformation, initially all flying in a straight line, then moving farther apart, back together again, then moving into a triangular formation, and, again, back into a side-by-side line. I continued to observe the objects until they were out of sight to the west."],"Case Number":"15251","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.264107,+-104.603621(15251)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15251) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-104.603621","City":"Pueblo","Region":"Colorado"}
