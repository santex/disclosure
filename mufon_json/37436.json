(the other 3 had multiple witnesses). if anyone has seen anything similar, or is watching the skies in western pa, please let me know. i'd love to know other people know what i'm talking about. thank you."],"Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Flash, Oval","Region":"Pennsylvania","Summary":"Big Circular Flash covering field","Date Submitted":"04/13/2012 08:24 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"04/12/2012 04:34 UTC","Latitude":"41.113671","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Volant","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Volant","Longitude":"-80.258952","Case Number":"37436","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
