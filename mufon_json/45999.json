Spotted a pulse energy contrail over the everglades, from south to north. could not tell where it originated. The contrail was exactly what has been associated with the aurora. I've known of The Aurora for almost 30yrs..To see the contrail in person as others have reported was exciting. Although I did not see the craft, I knew what I thought it was right away. But, now the big question, Why is it flying over the everglades at 5:30PM on Saturday. Where did it take off from, where did it land, and most important, where did it go?"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-03032013-0001"}
