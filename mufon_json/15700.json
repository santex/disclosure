i told you i wasn't lying, i saw that thing!', and she said 'wow, i believe you.' we never really spoke about it again. over the years i've told noone but a few sceptical friends, and the memory threatens to get hazy. but it was such a shocking, exhiliarating experience, and so simple to remember, very crystal clear and cut for me. i never wrote anything down for myself for posterity, but i do have some trouble with the exact date. i know for sure that i had the paper route in 1979, and maybe earlier, and i remember it could not have happened in july or early august as i was not in school for those months. i vaguely remember wearing a short sleeve shirt, no jacket, that morning, so it must have been anywhere from may to october. i don't remember seeing any tv reports locally, and i don't remember seeing any reports in the newpapers (ironically, the tribune-review, the paper i was delivering the morning of the experience). i know i'll never forget what i saw, and it's kept my life wonderous knowing that i was witness to something people don't know about, let alone believe. i just always laugh when i watch shows where such buttoned-down professorial debunkers throw around ridiculous hypothesis for what ufo's people see, i.e. weather balloons, storm sprites, ball lightening, zany cloud formations, etc. there is more to this life. i don't know about gods, and religion, but i do know that ufo's exist."],"Date Submitted":"08/31/1979 05:30 UTC","Tags":"City"}
