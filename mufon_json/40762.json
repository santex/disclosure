I noticed an orange light in the distance getting brighter and brighter. I pointed it out to my roommate. It then got dimmer then completely disappeared. About 10 seconds later, it brightened up again but got brighter and brighter and in the exact same spot. It then appeared to start shaking violently. After about 3 seconds of shaking, it then shot straight up faster than anything I have ever seen go through the sky. It left an orange trail behind it that only stayed for about a half second. It then disappeared through the clouds and never returned. I sat for about another 15 minutes hoping it would show up but it never did."],"Latitude":"34.485258","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-07132012-0004","Date of the Event":"07/13/2012 01:35 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40762.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40762.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"California"}
