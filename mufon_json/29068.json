The aircraft and I were heading in opposite directions - I was heading west on route 22 away from the airport, while the aircraft was heading east toward the airport. As I got closer toward the object, it appeared the object was moving very slowly since it seemed to be taking quite some time to get to the airport. However, as I got closer to the route 309 interchange, I noticed the aircraft was hovering without sound, roughly 200 feet up and within 100 yards west of route 309 north exit near route 22. It was definitely not a helicopter. Were there any other reports regarding this strange object?"],"City":"Allentown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29068.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29068.html"],"trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Allentown","There were no other sightings in Allentown on or around March 15th 2009"],"Case Number":"29068","Longitude":"-75.482413","Object Features":"Window(s), Wings","Date Submitted":"08/04/2011 02:02 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Shape":"Triangle, Other, Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.61054","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.61054,+-75.482413(29068)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29068) map </A>"}
