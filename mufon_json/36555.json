{"divs":["Sighting DetailsStrange Chemtrails over Jefferson City, MO. I have never seen anything unusual in the sky, until today. I have been greatly interested in UFOs for the past 3 to 4 years. In 1967, I was in the Navy on a ship in the Atlantic ocean many miles past the splashdown sight of a maned space capsule. For recovery in case of an overshoot. We were on high alert for sighting a UFO that was following the space capsule. We were told to never tell anyone about this alert. We didn���t see anything. I have observed UFO information since then until three or four years ago when my interest grew greatly. I have never had anything to report until now. 18 March 2012, 76 degrees, Jefferson City, MO. I went outside, 11:00 am CST daylight savings time, to sunbathe. Approximately 11:10 am I heard a faint jet engine roar so I blocked the sun with my hand, and opened my eyes. The sun was about 20 degrees from straight up in a high Eastern direction. I noticed a Chemtrail and jet near straight up, headed in an Eastern direction. In the clear sky the jet was moving slowly and the Chemtrail was bright, straight, and short, about a 10 degree arc of sky coverage long. It had not widened and quickly dissipated at the trailing end. I observed it for 5 to 10 seconds. I closed my eyes and put my hand down from blocking the sun. I then thought it strange that the Chemtrail was not widening and dissipated so quickly at its trailing end without widening. Similar to the many reports of holograms, jets, and Chemtrails. So in ��� to 1 minute (still hearing a slight jet engine roar) I looked again. Putting my hand up blocking the sun again, the Chemtrail and the jet was completely gone. A jet was now straight above heading in a Northern direction. The straight Chemtrail length was now about a 35 degree arc from straight up to the south. Again its trailing edge ended quickly with the Chemtrail not widening and straight. The blue sky was clear. I observed this for 10 to 15 seconds with the jet moving slow. I closed my eyes and unblocked the sun again. During the next ��� to 1 minute I was thinking how strange this was. I put my hand up blocking the sun and looked up again. The jet and Chemtrail was completely gone from its position again without showing signs of fading. I then saw it way over to the North about 50 degrees from straight up. This time it was heading East slightly North. I was next to the house so I don���t know how far West it started. It was about 45 degrees from straight up. Very long this time. Straight again. No widening of the dense white trail. Clear sky area with a few small low white thin clouds to the South. I closed my eyes again after observing for 15 to 20 seconds. A lawnmower engine started running in the neighborhood so I no longer heard the faint roar of a jet engine. I looked again about 10 to 15 seconds later and the heavy white line was completely gone, the entire length in the Northern clear blue sky. Ten to 15 minutes later I looked up again. Very thin large white hazy clouds were coming in from the South. I noticed through the haze a very long Chemtrail about 45 degrees from straight up to the South. It was headed East and very long. Again not expanding and straight. Ten to 15 minutes later the neighbor���s lawnmower stopped for a few minutes. I heard a jet engine roar louder than the previous ones. I looked again to the South. The Chemtrail was gone, large thin white clouded hazy sky. Above and North was sparse small white medium clouds. The jet was coming from the NorthEast headed West. It was almost straight above and moving faster than the others and ready to go out of sight over the house. Its long Chemtrail was slowly widening and gradually fading out and was drifting at various places sideways, both directions. This looked like a Chemtrail of a real jet like I have seen all my life. As I was looking at the wavy dispersing trail a bright jet instantly appeared near the trail heading SouthEast with no Chemtrail and no additional jet engine sound. It was slower like the previous jets. I watched it go straight for about a 15 degree arc in the sky and it disappeared instantly from the clear blue sky. The other jet with the normal Chemtrail was out of sight over the house. Its Chemtrail still visible. The neighbor���s lawnmower started again. 15 to 20 minutes later the Northern sky was getting the large thin hazy clouds which came from the South. I saw a jet in the NorthEast sky headed NorthEast and much higher than all the others. It had a short Chemtrail which widened and faded out. I also noticed the previous NorthEast to West Chemtrail was still slightly visible much wider and drifted in both directions at various points. I went inside and it was 12:18 pm CST daylight savings time. I sat at the computer and wrote this report."],"Summary":"Appeared artificial jets and chemtrails","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"38.579722","Longitude":"-92.168956","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36555.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36555.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"03/18/2012 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Wings","Region":"Missouri","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Jefferson City","There were no other sightings in Jefferson City on or around March 18th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/18/2012 04:53 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.579722,+-92.168956(36555)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36555) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"36555","Log Number":"US-03182012-0008","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Jefferson City"}
