As it came closer, i started to see the really green lights that seemed to be under neath the white lite. It stood perfectly still,for more than 5-6 minutes. I tried to take a picture but my camera wouldnt pick it up. So i went out of the house to see if i couuld see it better, Then it slowly pulled away into nothing."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
