We saw a strange light in the sky coming from the west. At first we thought it was an airplane, but it kind of zig zaged a little bit but stayed on its course. We grabbed the binoculars to get a close look at it. It looked like to big blue lights. Thats all they were. The thing that bothers us is when it was over our heads. The light got smaller and turned red. Then it just, dissapeared. There were no clouds that night. Just a crystal clear night. I don't know if it's an alien spacecraft, but I do know it is a ufo because it was flying, and me, my dad, and my cousin can't identify it. I wish I had a video of it but I don't. But I'm open to any explanation."],"Case Number":"50197","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Oklahoma","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Tecumseh","There were no other sightings in Tecumseh on or around August 24th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.2677,+-96.927599(50197)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50197) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"08/26/2013 08:26 UTC"}
