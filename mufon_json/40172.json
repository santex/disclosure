It's the fourth of July so occasional fireworks were still popping off, but they were very distant. I saw a glowing red-orange oval shaped thing slowly flying from right to left above the treetops. Then two more flew slowly by. I ran up onto my backporch and yelled for my mom and dad to come outside. As they came a fourth went by, which is the first they saw. Then 3 more came by. The last two wavered more than the others. I was terrified. I lost sight of the objects as they flew off behind trees behind my house. I hope other people in this area also saw these things, whatever they were. I tried to shoot video, but its nearly impossible to make out."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Summary":"7 glowing ovals flying across hwy280","Case Number":"40172"}
