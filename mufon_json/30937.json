He ran and opened the door yelling for me to come outside. He was frantic. I jumped up and came outside. As soon as I was outside I saw this huge red light in the sky. It appeared as large as a small planet but was glowing, almost as if it was on fire but it wasn't. It was traveling North to South moving very slow. It appeared to be going in a straight line. Then we saw two fighter-like jets, when the jets appeared the red ball of light moved fast and seemed to be going lower and disappeared from our sight due to large trees. The jets were flying very, very fast and was not keeping up with the ball of light. I could hardly speak while I was looking at the light, my mind was racing trying to understand what I was seeing. I have never seen anything like this in my whole life. As soon as it was gone I googled \"red balls of light in sky\" and found this website."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.926573,+-123.31719(30937)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30937) map </A>","Longitude":"-123.31719","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere"}
