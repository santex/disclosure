(my brother will report his story to you in his own words in the next few days with some video he has made of this incident.) we have carried our experiences with us all these years because we did not know where to turn. we tried telling our story to family members and close friends, but we were pretty much laughed at. we dismissed everything, thinking it was ball lightning, but today we know it was definitely not ball lightning. my brother and i are now living in germany and since 1991 have not had any more encounters or experiences of such kind."],"Date of the Event":"09/27/1991 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/17/2013 10:21 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Glowing orb outside my bedroom window","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"-76.455901"}
