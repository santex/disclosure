I was looking up at him. i was on the westside of the poll looking up at him when, in a vary clear sky, was what looked like a bright star coming from the northwest. It seemed to be at a vary high altatude and moving vary fast. It was heading southeast almost directly over head. From the time i first seen the object until it disappeared to the southeast was about 10 seconds. I told my partner to look but when he looked up a buzzard was flying by also and that caught his attention first and he missed the sighting. What stood out was the speed in which it was traveling. I am a amature astronomer and i know aircraft vary well, living near Wright Patterson AFB my whole life. This was no meteor or aircraft that i know of. I have observed the space-station and the shuttle fly over and this was neither."],"Disposition":"IFO"}
