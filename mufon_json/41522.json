It looked like a star, but it was just hovering in a straight path the the left of us and making no noise. Well aliens of course, I got excited at the fact that I get to witness such a thing, I've seen things like this before but. This was the first time we got it on tape. The motions and detail, well..like I said, just a straight path to the left and we couldn't make out any detail with the zoom on his phone. We just saw the colors. Vibrant and..indescribable. My feelings were...well you can kinda tell on the tape, I was happy and in disbelief, I thought it was just amazing! We lost the sight when it just flew into the darkness of the sky. Itt was moving pretty fast. On the film there is a tweet noise, just excuse it its my dads text alert sound."],"Case Number":"41522","Object Features":"None","Region":"Oregon","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Bend","Longitude":"-121.251549","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Bend","There were no other sightings in Bend on or around August 6th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.107068,+-121.251549(41522)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41522) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/07/2012 02:52 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:03:35","Country":"United States"}
