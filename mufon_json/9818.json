I'm not sure of the date, time of year, or the time of day, but I think it was evening. At that time I was young and had never heard of a UFO, so I had nothing in my imagination for comparison for what I saw. One of the neighbors called me and my husband outside to see the strange lights. Many neighbors were watching it descend on us - a giant, neighborhood-sized circular set of colored lights low over the neighborhood, and getting lower. I can't remember if the lights were only on the outside or all over. I just remember that the lights were colors, pulsating, and silently descending. I don't remember what colors were present. I don't remember seeing any object behind the lights, so now my mind wants to say that the lights were all over, but I'm not sure if that's a fact. The circle of lights was unbelievably huge. I was so terrified that I ran into the house to get my babies. I thought it was the end of the world and that the brilliant lights were God coming to earth, because my mind could not fit what I was seeing into anything that I already knew. I told my husband that I was not ready. We picked up the children and then I ran around in the house a few moments trying to figure out what to do. When we went back outside a few moments later, it was gone. A neighbor said that it just went away, and swung his arm up to the sky. The next day, the newspaper said that the lights were probably just the Aurora Borealis or something similar. Yea, right. You can���t use old reasoning to understand this new phenomenon. You have to just accept what you saw and not try to make it fit into what you used to know. Once you have experienced something like this yourself, it doesn't matter what the authorities or anyone else say to make it fit into something common. You saw. You experienced. You know. You just know. You have one piece of a mysterious puzzle, and you long to find people with other pieces. Eventually we will have the whole picture. Since that time, I have not agonized over what I saw or worried about it in any way. I feel comfortable with having had the privilidge of that experience. I do believe that what we saw was not of this world."],"Case Number":"9818","Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-97.13982","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Waco","There were no other sightings in Waco on or around November 30th 1966"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"11/30/1966 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"31.550863","Date of the Event":"11/30/1966 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03042008-0001","Country":"United States","Summary":"Pulsating lights over neighborhood accross the street from James Connaly AFB","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
