{"Summary":"three lights flying in perfect triangular formation","Date of the Event":"08/03/2012 08:10 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving home from McDonald's in Othello at around 8 p.m. and saw three lights flying over the mountains in a perfect triangular formation. I thought it was odd, I pulled over and noticed they weren't moving. I texted some friends in the area to make sure I wasn't seeing things, and they confirmed they saw it too. I continued driving home and noticed them moving relative to my speed, but they never seemed to get any closer, like a rainbow. Once arriving home a half hour later, I took my dog for a walk and noticed the lights still there. I continued walking my dog, normally, and looked up and the lights were gone."],"Date Submitted":"08/04/2012 10:58 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-119.175291","Object Features":"None","City":"Othello","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41432.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41432.html"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08042012-0030","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"02:05:30","Case Number":"41432","Region":"Washington","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Othello","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","Latitude":"46.825974","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.825974,+-119.175291(41432)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41432) map </A>"}
