my mother and i were very excited after this because this was now a greeting, not just a sighting. the light continued to make patterns and dance until our necks were just too sore to look up anymore. returning home (less than a mile away), i had to wake up my wife to tell her. incredibly enough, the light was still there. i had my wife come out and the craft moved around a bit for her so that she could witness the event as well. this was directly over my house! next thing we did was to call my brother. my brother drove over to take my mother and i out for a late dinner (we are all night-owls). as we left the house (as my brother's car pulled up) the light was no longer in that area of the sky, confirming that it most certainly was not a star. at the nearby denny's i told my brother what we experienced, quietly of course. admittedly, both my mother and i were in a state of bliss, almost drunk with joy, if you will. after about an hour long meal, i figured \"what the heck\" lets go back to the park and see if they will say hello for my brother. we returned to the parking lot. at first we saw nothing, but sure enough, after a few minutes we saw a bright light. it moved around. i pointed my finger again to show my brother and it did move again to the spot i pointed to! then we saw a second light, and then a third. each one of them moved around for a bit until we confirmed the sighting, then the 3 craft stopped in position, making a large triangle shape in the sky. strangely enough, we saw the craft shoot a beam of light (a small straight line of light) back and forth between the craft, the best way to describe it was like the two craft were playing catch with each other. the feeling i got from these beings is that they are extremely enlightened, benign beings, very playful...almost like children with an adult-like sense of responsibility. we also saw the emp flashes coming from the ground up, like lightning only it was a pillar of light flashing upwards. we all know that there will be major changes across the globe due to global warming, this is no secret. the impression i get from this contact is that they want to help us, but we must reject war first! we must, these technologies are too incredible to be put in the wrong hands! we don't have much time, we cannot afford to go into the next century and still maintain a paradigm of war, which amounts to mass murder and even annihilation. we have an incredible future ahead, we as a society must be willing to embrace it. this message is more important that the sighting, for it is the reason behind the contact. this was a contact witnessed by myself and 3 other witnesses throughout the night."],"Date Submitted":"05/12/2008 10:30 UTC","City":"Maplewood"}
