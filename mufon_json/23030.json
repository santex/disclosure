I was 17 at the time in either october or november. I was talking to my mother on the phone because i wanted to go home early due to sickness and I needed her permission to leave. I saw a metallic object in the sky, I had noticed it because the sun was making the object shine noticably. It didn't move nor make sound even though it was pretty far away. For some reason I didn't think anything of it even though I have been heavily interesting in UFO's since a child. I walked to the office and came back to that spot and it was gone except that TWO black helecopters were right around where I saw it. I was very suspicious because i had read in some stories that sometimes black helecopters arrive at a UFO scene. I am now just reporting this event so it is still somewhat of a blur to me, but thats definitely what i saw."],"Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"23030","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.755627","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Fresno","There were no other sightings in Fresno on or around October 15th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
