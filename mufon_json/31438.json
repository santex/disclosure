{"divs":["Sighting Details Object was diamond shaped and came straight down and then hovered over the houses then moved over to the middle of the street were it hovered for approx 20sec before going straight up. I was sitting on my neighbors steps and all of us and other neighbors saw it we all kind of just froze! I was a kid then and just recently remembered it. I asked some others who were there when we saw it and none remember. Some of my childhood friends however do recall seeing a object that I described later on in life."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"US-09022011-0039","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"39.983172","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.983172,+-75.225747(31438)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31438) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Summer time in urban neighborhood, saw a diamond shaped object over homes and power lines","Longitude":"-75.225747","City":"Philadelphia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31438.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31438.html"],"Object Shape":"Diamond","Case Number":"31438","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/02/2011 05:25 UTC","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around August 1st 1982"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date of the Event":"08/01/1982 04:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
