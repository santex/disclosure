{"divs":["sighting detailsi was coming over the bridge from exit 20 off of rt. i-90w and was at the stop light intersecting rt. 2, when i looked up into the blue sky (almost no clouds in the air and great visibility) and i saw something odd. at quick glance the object seemed to be one of those white banners that planes will trail behind them for advertising, but when i looked back i realized the banner was too far away to read and that there was no plane in front of it. this is when i decided to really look at it to figure out what the heck it was. it was not a plane as there was no tail, and if the nose was facing me then the wings would taper off, and there was no taper on the ends. it also was not rounded like a blimp or baloon so those were ruled out and it was far too long to be a helicopter. this object was white and rectangular and had two greyish\\offwhite stripes evenly separated in the middle of the object. after a few moments i saw the object begin to become almost transparent as it stayed near motionless. this part of the experience is hard to describe, but the object seemed to flicker a bit (by flicker, i mean it was visible one second, invisible the next, then back to visible, then back to invisible, etc.), this process lasted at most 5 seconds before the object was gone. i had a broad view of the sky and spent the next 10 seconds or so scanning the sky to try to find where the object had gone. i could not find any trace of it and then my light turned green. i was working at the time and going to an office to deliver equipment and a co-worker was in the car behind me following me to this location. (for the record this person adamantly does not believe in ufo's.) once we arrived at the loction a few minutes after the incident, we got out of our cars and shared our thoughts on what we saw. he said, like i did, that this was definitly not a plane, blimp, balloon, banner, glider, or helicopter. this was something neither of us have ever seen before. he looked at it for a while like i did, but he looked away when the object was in the process of \"flickering\" and when he looked back the object was completely gone from the sky. like myself, he spent the next 10-20 seconds before the light turned green scouring the sky to find any evidence of this object's presence. he too was unable to see the object again and was unable to explain the incident. if anyone else saw this same incident please email me about your experience (mfboomertime@yahoo.com), i would love to hear either a logical explanation of this event or someone else who could corroborate my experience."],"Case Number":"8067","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cigar, Square, Rectagular","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-71.101513","Latitude":"42.38053","Date Submitted":"10/05/2007 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Cambridge","There were no other sightings in Cambridge on or around October 5th 2007"],"Date of the Event":"10/05/2007 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Rectangular object hovering in air then became transparent and disappeared","City":"Cambridge","Log Number":"US-10052007-0006","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.38053,+-71.101513(8067)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8067) map </A>","Region":"Massachusetts","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8067.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8067.html"]}
