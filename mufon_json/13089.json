I have visited the specific site of the occurrence and looked for some clue that does not exist. Over the years, I did reconfirm this incident with my mother and father and with a neighbor (described below). We were visiting my Grandparents home 3-4 miles outside the Village of Gnadenhutten, Ohio (Tuscarawas County). It was a late summer (1961) evening, I went outside into the driveway to start my Father���s car, (15 years old and looking for any excuse to start the car) in preparation to leave on our 25 minute trip back into town. I noticed what appeared to be a large (10���-20���) fire in his woods across the road from the house (400-500 yard distance) slightly uphill and beyond a creek. I knew the area well, as, I hunted this entire 250 acre farm. I immediately reported the fire to my Grandfather when returning to the farmhouse, he was concerned about the spread of a potential forest fire, so, several of us proceeded to the side porch to verify the position. The fire did not appear to be spreading, and, he assumed some dear hunters were camping in his woods, however, he called a couple neighbors, to verify the location and get their opinions. Within 5-10 minutes we noticed what initially appeared to be a spread of the fire along the woods floor moving from our left to right and following the contour below the ridge of the hill. This was strange, as, the previous location of the fire was not burning. The fire was moving at an angle closer to our position when one of us noticed this was caused by a pulsating light (red some yellow mixed with white) coming down from above, not a fire. The reality that something was emitting a light strong enough to make the floor of the woods appear to be on fire took a few minutes to sink in. We all noticed an additional hazy light source in a band encircling the craft that was suspended or flying over the treetops. This thing was moving about 50-100 feet per minute. The one very unusual thing was the lack of any sound, in fact, the only sounds were the normal night creatures from this wooded farm area. This is significant in that this entire occurrence took place in a narrow (maybe 600 yards wide) valley surrounded by 250-300 foot hills. We all watched in total shock as we could more clearly see the shape of the unit as it approached us to within 250-300 yards. It was silhouetted against the hill and the trees were dark, so, the only light source was from within the craft, in a band around the center section and the light from the bottom. My best guess is that the craft was wider than my grandfather���s two-story farmhouse, and, ��� as high. At its closest point we could more clearly see the light shinning down through the treetops as a wavy but concentrated shaft of light all the way to the floor of the woods. The tree branches and leaves were visible under this somewhat blinding (high intensity) light. When the unit moved beyond the woods it was suspended approximately 150- 200 feet over a hay field and the shaft of light was not so apparent, however, it began to angle (about 45 degrees) itself skyward and with ever increasing speed soon (less than 10 seconds) became a distant white spot, before vanishing in the night sky. The bottom of the unit, when changing attitude was multi colored but mostly reds to orange mixed with some white. Two families of neighbors witnessed this occurrence as my Grandfather called both to question what they saw. Everyone agreed this was unexplainable, and, we should not tell this story, to avoid redicule from others. Everyone in my family is gone, however, my Sister (she was 11 at the time) does remember that some thing happened but not any details. Last year, I asked one of the neighbor boys if he recalled the incident and he was stunned that I would mention that evening. He confirmed, he saw this unexplainable occurrence but he was at an angle to witness the event more from an end position, whereby, the craft was moving toward their family before leaving the woods. His family porch would be ��� mile to the right of my Grandfathers as we viewed this craft moving from left to right and the point of departure was a little right of center from our porch position."],"Case Number":"13089","Country":"United States","Summary":"Woods floor appeared on fire, light/fire moved, noticed trees/leaves had pulsating light from above trees, object moved slowly closer than departed shortly.","Longitude":"-81.434281","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Gnadenhutten","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
