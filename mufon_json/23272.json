(silhouetted) at this point the cluster of ufo's again paused their traveling and did that funky dance again. the dance looked as if they were exchanging spots. each individual craft was approximately the size of one of the small box cars people drive around. there was no noise at all. they were internally illuminated at the bottom of each craft, not bright at all, no light coming down or outward from the craft. just a slight illumination, a self illumination of a melted silver\\ off white color. i myself, personally noticed a shadowing of the tops of each craft, to me it looked as if it were colored a dark bronze black mix. barely noticable. anyhow, as they paused the second time, i called for my kid inside and rushed them to come out to experience this before the crafts may disappear. my kid did witness the last few seconds of the sighting. we all seen the same thing. the experience amazed the lot of us. we all drew pictures of the sighting and all came out with the same dipiction of the sighting. we had no other explaination for the sighting. we thought, balloons, but balloons dont act controlled or stop in mid air. we all thought maybe aircraft, but no noise at all. the motions that the ufo's made a conventional plane could not do. ball lightning, but they did not flash or boom. whatever it was, it was definately an odd experience, exciting, exhilerating (to me) and i wish i could see them again. i have had other sightings before. as well as the witness's. thank you for listening and look up, you would be suprized at what you might see from time to time."],"Longitude":"-71.374677","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc, Egg, Oval, Other","Case Number":"23272","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Massachusetts","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/14/2010 08:15 UTC"}
