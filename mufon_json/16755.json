It was an un-seasonably hot sunny day and the sky was a deep blue with a few sparse wispy white clouds. I looked to my left, out the driver side window and saw a very distinct symmetrical, shiny, silvery metallic object hovering motionlessly in the western sky. My first thought was that maybe it was a helicopter because it was just hovering there and not moving, although its perfect symmetry and chrome-like appearance did not make that seem likely. The only way I could describe it would be that it was shaped like an acorn or upside down bell with the wider end up. I looked later on the internet for photos of ���acorn shaped UFO���s��� and was surprised to find that they were not that uncommon. The only difference was that the pictures that I found showed the object inverted, with the wider end facing down. I continued to watch the object for about 15 or 20 seconds and then to my amazement, it just faded away into the blue sky over the course of 4 or 5 seconds. That���s when I was convinced that I had seen a UFO. Weather balloons or helicopters don���t just disappear right before your eyes."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.956495,+-78.649163(16755)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16755) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Object Features":"Other","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Saw a shiny, metallic, acorn shaped object hovering against deep blue sky.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16755.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16755.html"],"Longitude":"-78.649163"}
