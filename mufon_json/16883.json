{"divs":["Sighting DetailsME, my fianc���e and our two children were walking in a public park when she said to our oldest \"Look at the light\" I looked up and saw a bright orangery red light flying at about 200 feet off the ground. It had something spinning end over end around it seemed separate from the light itself. It looked like a ball of fire trapped in a glass dome. It was at night so i couldn't see what was spinning around it but it looked like a disk of some sort. The object made no noise at all and to be as low as it was i thought i would at least hear something. The object flew in a straight path till it was out of our sight. I was almost scared but could not seem to take my eyes off of it, even to take a picture with my cell phone. It was way to low to be a plane and it was surely not a hot air balloon. there was nothing i could think of to come up with a reasonable explanation of the object. About 4 others aside from my party witnessed the event. All of them didn't know what it was. I never really considered myself to be a UFO believer but now i don't know."],"Case Number":"16883","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05112009-0018","Summary":"A round bright orange object with something spinning around it.
