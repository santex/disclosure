{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Riding in car - saw off in distance","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","Date Submitted":"07/17/2007 08:45 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsRight after the sun set - driving West, glanced up into western sky - one bright star was in the sky - sky was getting dark, sun had gone down a few moments before, saw a bright (brighter than star) white cigar-shaped almost like looking at an airplane wing head on - it was at a 30 degree angle in the sky and much larger than the star. I looked back down then glanced back up again and it very quickly it shrunk in size (same size as star) and disapeared quickly. When I first saw it I thought it was a comet. The reason I noticed it was because of its shape and brightness. My reaction was amazement. My brother and I were going somewhere and I pointed it out to him so he saw it too."],"Latitude":"36.643673","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Branson","There were no other sightings in Branson on or around July 17th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7477.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7477.html"],"Case Number":"7477","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.643673,+-93.218514(7477)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7477) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Branson","Date of the Event":"07/17/2007 08:45 UTC","Longitude":"-93.218514","Log Number":"US-07202007-0001","Country":"United States","Region":"Missouri"}
