I noticed a bright white light appear on the western horizon and tracked it steadily east until it disappeared again over horizon. WAY too bright to be a satellite, stars were not yet visible. No flashing or blinking FAA lights, no sound. I went inside & grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look - to the naked eye object appeared to be a single white light, however when viewed through binoculars object was five lights arranged in a circular pattern."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.348416","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.348416,+-108.287959(39301)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39301) map </A>","Region":"Colorado","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/12/2012 06:45 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Mancos","There were 4 other sightings in Mancos on or around June 9th 2012"],"Case Number":"39301","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39301.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39301.html"],"Date of the Event":"06/09/2012 08:55 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Flyby"}
