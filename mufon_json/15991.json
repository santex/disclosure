i'm am awake, right?!\" i told my wife to run upstairs and get me some pants and a shirt, because i am going to videotape this, because no one will believe this, and as soon as i go out side in my skivvies, one of the neighbors will be out walking there dog! while she did this, this...craft, did some other amazing things. #1 it waggled its wings, #2 it then flew backwards a short distance, #3 it then stopped, hovered, then, #4 waggled its wings again, pitched the nose slightly down, then #5 went forward again, then stopped, hovered, and unfortunately, before i could get outside to videotape, it shot off like a bat out of hell, and was gone!!! no noise, nothing! my wife asked it were a harrier or something. i said, \"no f-ing way! if it were a harrier, there wouldn't be a window left in the neighborhood, because they are uber loud!\" we are baffled to this day, as to what the hell it was, why it was hovering over our subdivision and how it didn't make any sound. and, i could kick myself for not being able to videotape it. i found out later, that it is possible to videotape through the window by putting the camera through the blinds and using them as a sort of makeshift tripod. i think, it is a secret military black project aircraft, and i sincerely hope...it's one of ours, because as will smith's charecter said in independence day, \"i got to get me one of these!\""],"Log Number":"US-03132009-0001","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"38.231518","Date Submitted":"04/05/2007 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.231518,+-83.559097(15991)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15991) map </A>","Date of the Event":"04/05/2007 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"15991","Region":"Kentucky","Longitude":"-83.559097","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Sharkey"}
