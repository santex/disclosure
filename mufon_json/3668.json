I told my friends to take a look but took off running after some girl that were walk ing on the cross street . The object was moving to fast to be a fighter jet . It was silver in color and looked like a rocket without fins . no smoke ,fire or con trail . What did I think ? After all These years I still don't know what to think . At that point of time in our history the military had nothing that could move that fast . The object was silver-gray , no wings or fins . It moved at a 45 degree angle and kept going up & up & up . I watched it go completely out of sight . I was in awe of the speed I was affraid it would come back . I told all my friends that were with me and they all said I was nuts . I know what I saw and I beleive I saw a UFO . I called Langley Field AFB , A major came by to take a statement after I had told what I had seen , he wrote down what I had said and off he went . I even remember the car the officer was driving ,a Ford Fairlane air froce blue . Redstone arsinal isnn't far from where I live I called there to see if they had shot up any rockets that day .No. Redstone was east of my location the object came from the west heading east-south east away from redstone .Langley Field was north-east from where I lived . These two location were not even close to where the object was comming from . For a long time every one of my friends called me spaceman ."],"City":"Newport News","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Region":"Virginia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3668.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3668.html"],"Summary":"Sliver-Gray rocket with no fins","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Newport News","There were no other sightings in Newport News on or around October 15th 1963"],"Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"3668","Date of the Event":"10/15/1963 03:00 UTC"}
