{"Summary":"Orbs over East Side Mario's North Bay Ontario","Longitude":"-79.463725","Object Shape":"Sphere","divs":["Sighting DetailsSaturday Aug 31 2013 11:45 pm North Bay Mall parking lot my father and i saw two reddish white orbs traveling slow in parallel from one another over east side mario's heading north. It was an overcast evening and a low cloud base so these things were low and could not be mistaken for anything conventional. One orb was higher up and it winked out or disappeared into the cloud base as it traveled. As my father dropped me off at home we saw another bright one under the cloud base heading north along King St and i watched it until it disappeared. My father went to the airport to see if there was any traffic but control tower it was shut down for the night."],"Date of the Event":"08/31/2013 11:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"46.279219","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.279219,+-79.463725(50458)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50458) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/06/2013 01:22 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ontario","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in North Bay","There were no other sightings in North Bay on or around August 31st 2013"],"Log Number":"CA-09062013-0001","Case Number":"50458","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50458.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50458.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"North Bay"}
