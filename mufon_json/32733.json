I walked outside to show my 2 year old the big dipper. I noticed a larger than normal light hovering in the west sky. I opened Google Sky maps to identify the object. It began moving East at a slow pace. I told my wife to come see this. There were airplanes in the area and we could obviously distinguish the difference between this object and the airplanes. As it moved East the light began to fade. I work in aviation and could tell the light was in our atmosphere and obviously not a typical aircraft."],"Longitude":"-111.084731","Summary":"Hovering light moved.
