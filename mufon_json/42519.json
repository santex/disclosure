{"Source":"MUFON","Region":"North Carolina","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and a friend were going to do some fishing before we even put our lines in the water he started yelling what the hell is that dude look I looked the wrong way then saw what he was talking about I saw some orange lights appear with what looked like another set of lights off to the right of it they disappeared and reappeared in a different spot. He said he saw a line of 5-6 lights before I saw what he was looking at. It was real strange they faded in and out in a matter of seconds and reappeared in a different spot then I didn't see them again we never even put our lines in the water we just looked up at the sky for an hour hoping to see it again. I texted my mom to say I saw some UFO thing in the sky and she said my step dad saw the same thing we later went to his girlfriends work since it was right up the road and we were talking about it and one of the delivery drivers also said he saw the lights in the sky."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Carolina Beach","There were no other sightings in Carolina Beach on or around September 12th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.035173,+-77.893597(42519)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42519) map </A>","Latitude":"34.035173","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/13/2012 12:15 UTC","Case Number":"42519","Log Number":"US-09132012-0001","Country":"United States","City":"Carolina Beach","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42519.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42519.html"],"Longitude":"-77.893597","Object Shape":"Oval","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Glowing orange lights disappearing and reappearing","Date of the Event":"09/12/2012 08:05 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
