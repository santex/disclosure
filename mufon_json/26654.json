It was a lot faster than a airplane, because we used their speed to compare. There were at least two planes in the area, because we have BWI nearby. It shot very straight towards the northwest. It was 20 times bigger than any star in the sky. Really amazing, not a shooting star."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.206104","Object Features":"None","City":"Columbia"}
