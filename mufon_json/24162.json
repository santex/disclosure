He looked up and said, \"What's that?\". I looked and said, \"I don't know\". It was a burning flame that just hovered and seemed suspended, high up in the sky. We stood watching this for about 2-3 minutes and another man stopped and looked up, too. He said, \"What's that?\". We both replied, \"We don't know\". Never seen anything like that before. (This was about 10:18 CST)in the southern sky. The flame looked orange and yellow and eventually got smaller and smaller, until it disappeared. P.S. There was someone else who posted UFO and 2 witnesses and now the post appears to be gone. I joined GLP tonight because I too saw this and wanted to add to his post. No pics. My boyfriend's iPhone wasn't able to photograph this. There were 3 of us that stood there watching this in disbelief."],"Log Number":"US-07052010-0015","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24162.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24162.html"],"Case Number":"24162","Longitude":"-94.67862","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 02:07 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.730673,+-94.67862(24162)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24162) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Minnesota"}
