Directly above the Chaulk River Nuclear Facility at approx 1-2km away were two symetrical vertical spyralling contrails. They began at approx 5000ft and ended at approx 8000ft. They were very sharp and spyralled like a DNA strand. They did not move and did not evaporate for approx 1 hr. 2 other witnesses present. Not sure if they want to be known. Although this is not a UFO, It may give weight or evidence to sighting dated 2 Aug 12. It may give weight or evidence or disclosure to projects at Chaulk River Nuclear Facility"],"Date Submitted":"08/02/2012 10:22 UTC","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Longitude":"-77.286225","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Petawawa","There were no other sightings in Petawawa on or around July 19th 2012"]}
