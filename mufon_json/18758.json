My brother took a series of images, which were unfortunately a bit blurry. The attached is the best example. It would seem obvious that these were fireworks, but they were much higher, moved upward for 5 or 10 minutes in a very slow, controlled fashion, and seemed quite far away (they cast no reflection on the lake ��������� I expect they were at least 5-10 miles away) and large, based on the distance. It was difficult to make out any shape or mass. They were amber to red in color. There were 7 witnesses total, all of whom were mesmerized and didn't know what to make of the event, and I assume many people in the area (Twin Lakes, WI in the Lake Geneva area) saw this. ��������� Very strangely, we witnessed a similar event last July 4, though it was only 1 light of the same color, higher and farther away, moving very fast across the sky."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18758","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"42.591684","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Lake Geneva","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Lake Geneva","There were no other sightings in Lake Geneva on or around July 4th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Floating orbs over WI lake on July 4","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 12:00 UTC"}
