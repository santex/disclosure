Two very bright orange objects moving very slow almost as if decending. within milliseconds of first seeing they were both moving faster north east not far from eachother. I scrambled to set my scope on any of the 2, I managed to get one object in my scope. I tracked it for approx 4 sec than I moved it ahead to maybe catch the second one. the object never re-appeared ahead of itself where I had my scope fixed. I looked up and they were both gone. I couldnt make out any significant detail on the object. it wasn't as bright in the telescope. I knew right away that they were not stars or satellites. I held my breathe during most of the sighting.
