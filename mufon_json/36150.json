Three were in a row with one centered in front. All were equally spaced apart but in a close grouping. The one on the east end of the row of three took off and disappeared on the eastern horizon in a matter of a few seconds; faster than anything I know to be possible. The others stayed in place for several minutes. The one that left returned,at the same impossible speed, and stopped from where it had left. The four then appeared to ascend until they faded out of sight within a few seconds."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/14/1969 02:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36150.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36150.html"],"Case Number":"36150","Summary":"FOUR STARLIKE CLUSTER MOVING NOUTH TO SOUTH ONE ON EAST LEFT AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND RETURNED ALL WENT UP AND FADED OUT OF SIGHT","Latitude":"40.879655","City":"North Canton"}
