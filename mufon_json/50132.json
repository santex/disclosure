We glanced up at three lights that looked like just balls of fire and at first didnt pay it much attention thinking they were planes. As they crossed Fletcher we realized they were only about 200 ft in the air and had no other lights, such as a green, red or other lights that would make them identifiable as a something we are familiar with. The lights also were more amber in color much like fire and not white. We lost sight of them in the trees so we stopped the car in at that moment we saw one but now it was going west. Only a helicopter could make a move such as this and it went right over and did not make a sound. Helicopters also have additional lights this thing had no other lights. Other people had to see this thing as well. But we have searched the internet and no one has reported anything that we can have found so far. We did not think to record this either with our phones which we now regret."],"Summary":"While traveling down Fletcher Ave we noticed three lights","Date Submitted":"08/24/2013 11:42 UTC","Latitude":"28.059618","City":"Tampa","Region":"Florida","Longitude":"-82.502409"}
