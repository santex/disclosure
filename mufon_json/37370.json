I was passing thru Longview Texas just West of the Eastman plant when I noticed an aircraft traveling from North to South passing over me. Altitude was about 2000 feet I would estimate. I first noticed it by the lights it carried, some solid and some blinking. Nothing exceptional there. I happened to be just under it when it passed over, and was able to clearly see the outline of its body, what I called a chevron at the moment but others might call a boomerang. Its flight was steady and straight, could not hear it as I was in vehicle. Speed was not noteworthy, about what you would expect of jet aircraft. When I saw the shape of the vehicle I knew it was unconventional, and NO it was not a stealth fighter or stealth bomber. I strongly feel this is probably U.S. hardware we are not yet informed of just like Stealth technology a few years ago."],"Longitude":"-94.713508","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"04/05/2012 08:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04112012-0008","Date Submitted":"04/11/2012 02:06 UTC"}
