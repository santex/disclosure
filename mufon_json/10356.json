{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was leaving my apt. in Cal, on the way to get some food. I was driving when I noticed a very irregular pattern of a light in the sky. Since it was night I knew that I the brightness of the light was irregular and slow moving. I slowed down to be a better glimpse of the LIghts. They were really slow moving and, by the pattern of smoke they were leaving, it was hard to dismiss the lights as a slow moving planes. The were really bright and the heads, and the trail left behind were like a zig zag pattern. I wasn't really afraid, but more amazed on how alluring the sight was. I have held on to these pictures for quite some time, but figure that it would bother me if I can at least figure out what I was looking at. Can anyone help me?"],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10356.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10356_submitter_file1__DSC01969.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10356_submitter_file2__DSC01973.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/10356_submitter_file3__DSC01976.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10356.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10356.html"],"Summary":"Can someone please help me identify what this is?","Region":"California","Latitude":"36.783111","Case Number":"10356","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"04/15/2008 06:16 UTC","Log Number":"US-04152008-0014","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Longitude":"-119.411782","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[""],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.783111,+-119.411782(10356)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10356) map </A>"}
