Then i noticed a bright flash of light under the big dipper. As soon as the flash happened i saw a bright circular light that shot north east from where it first appeared in a slightly upward angle. It stopped suddenly, blinked and then disappeared. It was a bright bluish white color that moved much faster than any of the planes seen around here from the local airport. The lights were also about 20 times brighter than those seen on an airplane. I didnt know what it was because i knew instinctively that it wasnt an airplane. I had already seen two that night.
