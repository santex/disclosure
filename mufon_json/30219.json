{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsLast year, on July 3rd 2010, after fireworks over Union Lake in West Bloomfield Township, I witnessed a number of orange lights that moved fairly slowly from SW to NE across the NW quadrant of the sky, approximately 12 to 18 lights total. I made a MUFON report about this a few days later, and it is in the archive. The EXACT same thing tonight, July 16, 2011 - I put the dog out at about 10:45, and went outside to turn off the sprinkler. Returning in, I had a clear view of the western sky -- same exact kind of light, orange, non-blinking, moving a bit more rapidly than last year, and appearing a bit brighter. No sound of any kind. here were about 8-10 over a period of 15 minutes, all originating at the exact same place on the horizon, about the \"8 o'clock\" position, and traversing the sky until disappearing in the north-northwestern sky. I was viewing this event from near the eastern shore of Union Lake in West Bloomfield Township, Michigan. The nearest major cross streets are Cooley Lake Road and Hospital Road or Cooley Lake Road and Hiller Road. Weird. The color is the oddest thing, I've never seen any aircraft with lights such an orange color. Of course, after watching them for a period, I decided to go get my camera. By the time I came back out with camera, memory card, and ready to go, they were gone, no more appeared."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30219.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30219.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Bright orange lights moving fairly rapidly from SW to NE with no sound.","Log Number":"US-07162011-0020","City":"White Lake","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/16/2011 11:30 UTC","Latitude":"42.614754","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/16/2011 10:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.446883","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in White Lake","There were no other sightings in White Lake on or around July 16th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.614754,+-83.446883(30219)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30219) map </A>","Case Number":"30219","Region":"Michigan"}
