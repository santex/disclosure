I was triagular shaped and revolving slowly with 3 bright lights. One on each corner. The center was changing color constantly and it would move to the right and left at times then just hover for a few minutes. I would drop down and stop then move back to its original position and stop. This went on for at least twenty minutes. I then took 2 picture with my cellphone and a video which didnt appear in the filming cause I was moving it around hoping it would be in the lense opening. It then shot up to the left and blinked out. I know it was not ballons or a helicopter or any other thing. It was awesome to see however."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.238335,+-91.187094(36353)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36353) map </A>","Summary":"Triangle object rotating 3 bright lights on each corner and center changing colors","Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Log Number":"US-03092012-0014","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Monticello","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Date of the Event":"03/09/2012 02:00 UTC","Latitude":"42.238335"}
