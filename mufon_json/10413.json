{"Object Shape":"Cigar, Square, Rectagular","divs":["sighting detailsim sorry its taken me so long to report this to anyone, i knew what saw, but i just didnt know or who, who to report it to. \\ i was around 12 years old and my mother was driving our dodge van back home to wakefield, mass. from boston, when i saw (it was either over the prudential tower, or the john hancock building) (sorry i cant remember),but it was a very long, cigar shaped object, but with squared off ends, with almost square like windows all along it, absolutley not a plane,very squared off, it was dark grey. moving at a slow pace, while a jumbo jet was flying above, what i remember to be the john hancock building, had to make a sharp and very obvious turn to avoid it. the ufo flew off very fast. my mother saw it also, and was amazed. it was not any earthly vessal we have ever seen, and because the jet plane took such evasive action to avoid it, tells me it wasnt any planed flight by any earthly organization. this is a vision that will stay with me for the rest of my life."],"Date of the Event":"04/01/1976 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10413.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10413.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10413.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.366971,+-71.050923(10413)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10413) map </A>","Summary":"very long cigar shaped, but with squared off ends, not round","Latitude":"42.366971","Case Number":"10413","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Boston","There were no other sightings in Boston on or around April 1st 1976"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04192008-0002","City":"Boston","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Massachusetts","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-71.050923","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/01/1976 12:00 UTC"}
