I looked for where the nose was coming from and saw the lights the helicopter had. I noticed the object when a bean of light emitted from its lower extremities and flew maybe less than 500 ft. from where I was standing. I thought it was a helicopter until i noticed that there was only 1 helicopter sound (meaning there are 2 different sounds from 2 helicopters, only one was heard). The object, shape and everything could not see or hear, the beam of light showed for about 30 seconds before diminishing. then noticed it would take sharp or hard banked turns. I felt weird, like something is wanting us to know its here... I would never think that near a small airport like this, one would show up. The Object and helicopter flew out of sight"],"Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON"}
