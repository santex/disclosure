It was yellow and orange. I could have been the sun that gave it the glowing appearance. It was taken after 4 PM so the sun would have been to the left of the object. I have another picture prior to this one and there is no orange glow. I don't know it # 22 is the same object or not. I have many similar photos as 22 but 26 is really something. I must have snaped the shutter at just the right second. It came and went very fast."],"Source":"MUFON"}
