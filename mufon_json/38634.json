Soon after that I noticed another and another. 5 in all flying upwards at the same speed close together. There was no sound. The first stalled and then turned upwards, when the second reached the same spot it too turned upward and so on all turning in the same spot going the same direction. I called it in to 9-11, that minute, and I was directed to an airport phone # that was a recorded message. Apparently they didnt take me serious or didnt want me to report it. Very Strange indeed,. My friend also witnessed the exact event about a mile away. It should be noted there is a military base 10 miles south of here."],"Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Latitude":"34.259972","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"5 orange lights flying in the same pattern all asended in the same spot same direction","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38634.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38634.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
