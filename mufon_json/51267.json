Only this time it was heading south and was blacker than the sky above it. It came later than the first siting Monday at 8:43. I'm in Golden Colorado. Whatever this thing is my house is on its flight path. It's like the thing they saw in Ellis county Texas. Black Boomerang craft that's blacker than the sky when your under it and it had a mist or cloud around it looking from the side or behind. It was flying fast with no sound. My roommate witnessed it this time with my friend and I. Whatever it is it's trying to hide from us. Kinda creepy now. I'm betting it's gonna be back again tonight I suspect. To bad I don't have a thermal camera to set up. It's incredible!"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Latitude":"39.706279","Date Submitted":"10/02/2013 04:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.706279,+-105.15652(51267)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51267) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10022013-0012","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"51267","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Golden","There were 2 other sightings in Golden on or around October 1st 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51267.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51267.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
