Flew directly over me during the initial first years of numerous UFO close encounters and sightings. The two craft were black with no apparent lights but can be seen in front of star light, or the background light of the upper atmosphere. I don't remember reporting this but here it is for record. I believe these two were military stealth aircraft (although not very stealthy at the time of sighting). I don't have record of what the exact time and date of the event was but I think it was in the fall of 2008."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in White City","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"08/01/2008 10:00 UTC","Country":"Canada","Region":"Saskatchewan","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Wings","City":"White City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.443501,+-104.356922(24565)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24565) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"24565","Date Submitted":"07/16/2010 06:51 UTC"}
