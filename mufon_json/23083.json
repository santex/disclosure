Left home about 2:00am. We seen large UFO's over our truck. We thought it was maybe street lights as we're looking up and out the close tinted sunroof. Once we opened the sunroof, the UFO's were large and triangle. Some appeared to be following our every move. We then rushed home to get our Canon camera with 6x optical zoom. We captured super clear photo's. We simply don't know what in this world can move like that. We let friends and family see the photo, yet don't know what to make of it. ** PLEASE NOTE ** We have a still photo and can send it UPS. Our Camera is with is with a friend.
