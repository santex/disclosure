They resembled towerbeacons but I thought there were no towers in that vicinity so I stopped to lookat it. I then noticed a bright star-like white light that was ascending towardsthe red lights. When it reached the red lights the white light disappeared.About twenty seconds later the red lights started to move in a NNW direction. Iwatched as they slowly faded into the distance. It was overcast that night, Icould discern any structure, however the two red lights maintained theredistance from each other and remained paralell to the ground throuout the event.No sounds detected. If feel I witnessed something highly unusual as I have noexplanation for it.Benjamin Hart"],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"1592","Date Submitted":"03/19/2002 02:20 UTC","Summary":"two stationary red lights and one moving white lig","Latitude":"39.930947","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
