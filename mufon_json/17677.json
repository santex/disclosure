{"divs":["Sighting DetailsSo I'm sitting outside, smoking a cigarette looking at the sky because the sunset looks cool. When I notice something that should not be there, a light is just sitting in the sky it's not a plane because it isn't moving and it's not a star (stars don't \"pulsate\"). So I take out my phone and snap a pic. When you look at the photo it looks like a part of the sunset until I inverted the colors, the sky turns blue but this \"object\" turns black."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:02:15","Longitude":"-75.219102","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.694732","Case Number":"17677","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.694732,+-75.219102(17677)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17677) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-06262009-0011","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Easton","There were no other sightings in Easton on or around June 26th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Easton","Date of the Event":"06/26/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/26/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17677.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17677_submitter_file1__light.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17677.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Strange light in the sky."}
