It was around 1 am and we guarding the motor pool. I felt something behide my neck and look up and there they were 3 Heagon shape ufo's. They were not giving out light but our post had a light in yellow light that reflicked the light up. So we were looking at this object for about 5 minutes and then all three ufo's flew across the street over a two story bulding then vertically took off in light speed into the shy in a flash. On one of your TV show you show a old retired man that saw more or less what I saw and I want to say is thank you for showing the animation of the hexagon ufo's it gave me some peace.
