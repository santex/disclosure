I was looking up at the stars and planets. My first impression was that the object was an U.F.O. When I saw the object, I immediately went to the west side of the garage to watch the object. I then followed the object as it flew across the southern sky. At first the object was more brightly lit. As it travelled east, only three red lights and one white light remained on. One red light was in front the second was on the side the third red light was in back. All three red lights were on the mid level. The red lights were blinking. The white light, however, seemed to be larger, did not blink, and was on the bottom. I could perceive the outline of an oval shape. The noise sounded jet-like. The objects flight was level, constant, and fast. When the object moved east, I lost it behind the trees."],"Date Submitted":"04/18/2003 10:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON"}
