(and actually another friend was visiting, too, so they both came outside.) i didn't want to take my eyes off of the objects, just in case they moved or did something interesting. my friends came outside and i pointed them in the right direction. i asked them what they thought the objects were. my one friend said immediately that she thought they were ufos, and the other friend asked if they might be helicopters. we watched the objects for a good 10 minutes. they did not move at all. the strange part, in my opinion, is that it seemed like the more we talked about them, the dimmer they got. and they faded out, one by one. the one of the far left end went dim first. as it went out, the next one got dim, then disappeared. the third object\\light, on the right end, didn't fade out immediately. we stood there watching it until it eventually disappeared, like the light switch was simply flipped to 'off.' and i mean it disappeared instead of going dim. from the time i noticed the objects to the time the third one finally disappeared, no more than fifteen minutes elapsed. during this \"sighting\", after the first object disappeared from view, my female friend and i jokingly talked about how they knew we were watching them. i wasn't exactly joking, though. i had the distinct feeling that the objects were aware of our awareness of them. and i felt like the third object \"chose\" to stay in view for a little while longer to make a point. yes, as ridiculous as that seems. and yes, it occurred to me that it is april fool's day, but i am indeed telling the truth."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.693485,+-105.936759(22609)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22609) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22609.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22609.html"],"Date of the Event":"03/31/2010 10:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/01/2010 11:10 UTC","City":"Santa Fe","Region":"New Mexico","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"22609","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-04012010-0023","Longitude":"-105.936759","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"35.693485","Summary":"Three star-like objects in formation.","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
