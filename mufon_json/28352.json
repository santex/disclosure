She was on a farm near Toefield, Alberta and had decided to walk into the pasture to find her horse. She had her camera with her. She noticed a donut shaped object, brilliantly lit up, hovering over the pasture. She remembers that it may have had a dome on top. After watching it for a while, just hovering and not moving she took a picture of it. She was not afraid as at the time as she was wondering what it could be. It was not until after the event that she realized it was a ufo. She looked at the camera to see if it captured an image and indeed it did. Picture attached. When she looked up to take another photo the object had disapeared."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28352.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28352_submitter_file1__June7017.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28352.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/04/2004 07:00 UTC"}
