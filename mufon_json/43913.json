I quickly ran to a large group of people (about 20 people) and told them to look at it, by this time it had been going on for 5 minutes, it still continued to spin fly in circle patterns and tight hook patterns, just then we seen (what we think) a jet flying after it, then we got the real scale of the craft, compaired to the jet that was really flying fast and tightly manuvering, the ufo was amazingly huge and had to of been covering miles within split seconds in the sky while making circle patterns, it seems to me that the ufo was doing no harm, but was toying with the jet fighter. After watching it dip and dive and circle around the jet it flew directly at the ground. From my perspective it went behind the tree line, i spoke with other people that seen it from a different view and they said that the lights seperated and split off then joined up and flew away at a high rate of speed. After it was gone we seen the jet still searching, then a helicopter could be seen in the distance in the same area with its spotlight on. I tried taking video but ended up with one snapshot that just shows a streak in the sky. My thoughts are this, this thing had to have been larger than an aircraft carrier, it was clearly showing off. Not only that but i was at a fire festival at the time, it was almost like they(ufo) were mimicking the fire dancers on the ground."],"Date of the Event":"11/10/2012 08:12 UTC"}
