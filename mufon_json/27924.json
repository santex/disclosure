approximately 18:10 while at work, i was observing aircraft that left persistent contrails, when i noticed in the sky what appeared to be a spherical object that appeared to flash or reflect light as if it had large and small facets and slowly rotated, although no obvious exterior surface irregularities or distortions. i observed the object hovering for approximately, less than one minute, in the north northwesterly direction approx. 30 deg.���s from the celestial median at which time i walked quickly to the nearby office (approx.60 ft. away) and retrieved a pair of 10x50 bushnell binoculars, returned to my previous position and continued to observe the object with the aid of the binoculars. i then obtained a clear visual acquisition of what appeared to be a uniformly spherical object, with a dull silver\\aluminum alloy external appearance. there continued to be what appeared to be reflections emitted by the object. i was unable to see any uneven surface characteristics which would cause these reflections. within the following one minute time frame the object began to proceed to the north northeasterly direction, with a wide turn to the north for 90 seconds until it was downrange sufficiently and no longer visible. the object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 8000 ��� 10,000 ft., i make this assumption based on the presents of scattered cirrus clouds (estimated altitude of 23,000 - 25,000 ft.) as reference points as the object passed underneath these small clouds. the object caught my attention because it did not appear to be visually consistent with any known aircraft or aircraft configurations that i typically observe. it did not appear to be a balloon as it clearly demonstrated controlled flight at a speed inconsistent with balloon operation with the current wind conditions at the time of the sighting. this december 22nd incident was the second sighting within a little more than week���s time. i had very briefly viewed a similar object approximately one week to ten days prior to this sighting. it was during this time i decided to take the initiative to be more vigilant in my observation of the surrounding sky. it was also at this time i decided to bring a camera to work with me to record, if possible, any further unusual sightings thus giving credence to any report of a sighting. it is in my opinion that an unverified or unsubstantiated report does not always bare the same significance when compared to a report with photographic evidence. at 18:44 january 3rd, 2011 while at work, i was observing and photographing aircraft that left persistent contrails when i observed an object similar to the object i had previously seen (a spherical metallic looking object that appeared to flash or reflect light as if it had large and small facets and slowly rotated). the object was stationary and i observed the object for 10 seconds before training a camera in the direction and taking one photograph. i then relocated myself to a position approximately 10-15 feet away for an unobstructed view. i then took two more additional photographs within a four second time frame. total elapsed time frame for the three photographs was 50 seconds. there appeared to be no directional of the object. the object remained visible for one additional minute following my last photograph and as i redirected my attention to my camera for a readjustment, i looked back up into the sky and the object was no longer visible. i continued photographing distant aircraft with eight more photos taken of the adjacent area. no object(s) can be seen in any of these photos. my last photo was taken at 18:55:10, at which time i felt i had possibly captured on digital image what i had seen. within 25 minutes the sky in the vicinity of the objects was dark enough to allow the light from any possible celestial body to be displayed and there were no celestial bodies comparable to this size, in this area or below this area that could be seen. now, please take note, the image that i have captured on digital imaging is not what the object actually appeared like as i watched it visually with my eye sight, as the object actually appeared to be dull metallic. when i returned home later that night, downloaded the images to my computer and examined them, i noticed the difference in their appearance and i then found another object, to the left and further in the distance which looks similar to the object that i captured on the digital images that i had originally seen. the camera i was using was an olympus d-545z, 4 megapixel ccd digital imaging. details of properties of photograph files; photo p 1030269.jpg created: monday, ���january ���03, ���2011, ������6:45:22 pm dimensions: 2288x1712 width: 2288
