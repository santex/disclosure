But it was the middle of summer so I expected that. I heard a humming noise outside my windows and lot of lights coming from my window pulsating. I look outside my bedroom window to take a peek and I see this huge ship with pulsating lights of all forms just hovering above my driveway. The lights intensified and I heard my dog going absolutely insane in the other room. My brother woke up screaming, I was in so much pain, it felt like the house was on fire. I passed out nearly as soon as I hit the floor. After waking up I noticed 30 minutes had passed and everything had quited down like nothing had happened. I had a huge migraine but I looked out of my window and saw the ship going straight up and out of the atmosphere."],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Decatur","There were no other sightings in Decatur on or around June 15th 2004"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Summary":"Large roundish disc.
