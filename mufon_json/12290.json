I was just talking about having babies, (one of them is pregnant) and the importance of parents becoming aware when they bring children into the world. I remember getting really adamant saying its not about being perfect parents but about the repair and about caring about the next generation with love and compassion. Then I happened to look up. And said \"what the heck is that?\" It looked like a bullet shooting through the sky but instead of going straight it made wave patterns up and down as it crossed the sky. It must have crossed the entire section I was looking at in about 5 seconds (much too fast for an airplane) and then \"puff\" it disappeared. The \"puff\" was important because it almost went out like a match or a light."],"Log Number":"US-08312008-0010","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.42807","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Santa Barbara","There were no other sightings in Santa Barbara on or around August 13th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Wave like pattern bullet","Source":"MUFON","City":"Santa Barbara"}
