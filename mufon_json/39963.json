He exclaimed \"hurry, look out your back window, there's something crazy in the sky\". When I ran outside, a red orb was floating over some houses in my neighborhood while heading over the treeline near the woods. Several neighbors witnessed the object, and were walking around their houses to watch it. The object made no noise as it flew. As it was some distance over the treeline, it stopped and hovered for a few moments, before turning to the right, and ascending. As it ascended, I lost sight of it due to a tree that is close by in my back yard. It was like nothing else I have seen before. When it was close to me, and I could see it in detail, there was no body to the object; it consisted entirely of a glowing red orb. Overall, many people in my neighborhood witnessed it, and they all seemed to agree that it was definitely not any sort of conventional aircraft."],"Log Number":"US-06302012-0025","Country":"United States","trends":[],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"44.324004","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.324004,+-85.596674(39963)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39963) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39963.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39963.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-85.596674","Region":"Michigan"}
