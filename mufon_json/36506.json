I went half way to tree turned around and faced North West, roughly 315 degrees on compass. Was smoking cigarette looking around, cloud layer moving in from West, I was looking all most straight up still facing North West and I could see the tree branches at the top of my vision, I notice something move into view coming from the South East (which was behind me) as it cleared the tree branches flying to the North West. It lasted less than 10 seconds,it went behind the roof of the house, straight course to the North West, looked kind of like a dull gray color, V shaped, no sound at all. I would say it was over 500ft high but under cloud layer, still pretty good size, you couldn't miss it. It was moving at a good rate of speed."],"Region":"Illinois","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.790592,+-89.360643(36506)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36506) map </A>","Latitude":"40.790592"}
