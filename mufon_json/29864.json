I was facing north and the object was traveling east bound. I watched it travel horizontally in a zig zag pattern then it shot up and disappeared in less then a second. I called the local precinct. Which is the 7th precinct and it turned out that several other people witnessed the same thing and had called them to report it. I called my family and friends to tell them what happened and they all saw it as well. It was definitely abnormal and I was in awe. My sister and her kids were outside in a different town close by and they saw it with neighbors. It freaked out my niece so bad that she was crying."],"Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.717373"}
