It looks like a fireball and part of a saucer. It then started to move at super sonic speed when a jet was flying towards it. It then disapeared into the sky. I was on my way to work when I got out of my truck and saw the object. The photos attached would need to be zoomed in to see the definition of the object."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10162006-0007","Longitude":"-104.98176","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/16/2006 09:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.654505,+-104.98176(5585)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5585) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/16/2006 09:00 UTC"}
