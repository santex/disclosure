I was looking roughly south east when i saw a bright fireball that had a bright green glow around it- fly through the sky for a couple seconds. It looked a lot like a falling star but much larger and brighter. It also looked as if it were very close which could have been because of the size. Strangely enough it truly had a bright green glow. Anyone see it??"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.529946,+-117.706033(29238)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29238) map </A>","Case Number":"29238","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29238.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29238.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/25/2011 11:30 UTC","Longitude":"-117.706033","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-08012011-0044","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Laguna Niguel","Date Submitted":"08/01/2011 08:16 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.529946","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Summary":"Green fireball flying through the sky for a couple seconds till what it seemed a burn out"}
