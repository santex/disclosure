I saw an orange triangle, best described as shaped like a typical paper airplane, with flames shooting out of the back. It was just above the tree line. I watched it for maybe 5 seconds as it was travelling very fast. It disappeared behind a tree and I waited for it to emerge on the other side, where it did not. I did not see it again after that. About 10 seconds following this siting, in the horizon - which was dark and a very clear sky, I saw two light flashes, one after the other. I became somewhat spooked as I was home alone with my young baby so I went back inside, puzzled and wondering if I had just seen a UFO. I believe I did. Thanks for letting me share my experience."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08092012-0015","Region":"West Virginia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange glowing triangle with flames as emissions shooting through air and disappearing","Longitude":"-78.044543","Latitude":"39.34169","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.34169,+-78.044543(41588)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41588) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
