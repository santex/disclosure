however sometimes these e.t.v.s turn on their sides flip over charge shape completely & even morph. so i'm not sure. all i know is that since i reported this incident the sky has been sprayed very heavily with chemtrails up to 8 aircraft just last night. now we have gone from warm 80 degree heat to winter weather in less than 24 hours. its raining \\ flooding again and very windy. of course this also means no one is going to look at the sky and watch ufos."],"City":"Brighton","Summary":"Orbs & Triangles","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-0.126712","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"08/13/2007 01:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Brighton","There were no other sightings in Brighton on or around August 13th 2007"],"Region":"England","Date of the Event":"08/13/2007 01:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.852881,+-0.126712(7673)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7673) map </A>","Country":"United Kingdom","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
