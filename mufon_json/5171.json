I noticed a satellite traveling across the sky and pointed it out to the kids. (I remember watching for satellites in my parents yard when I was young) Hoping to see another I was watching the sky somewhat closely when I saw a similiar light traveling south east. It became brighter than any star in the sky, almost with the intensity of the moon but still star size. Then the light faded out. Not like a switch had been turned off but a slow fade that lasted maybe two seconds. The light returned to its original glow and continued forward for about five to ten seconds and then faded out completly."],"Latitude":"36.99932","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Bowling Green","There were no other sightings in Bowling Green on or around July 31st 2006"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Almost like a satellite, but different"}
