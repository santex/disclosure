I felt the urge to look up and to my right (west). I saw a diamond shaped object bobing in the air. It was very bright and changed colors. I got my wife and daughter to look but they were sceptical. To make sure I was seeing what I thought I was I got 2 neighbors to look. We all saw the same thing. While watching the ufo I believe it made a comercial airplane change course. Shortly after that I believe a small airplane went to intercept the ufo. I can't say for sure because by that time the ufo was barely in sight. It had moved a great distance to the west. Total view time 15-20 min. I did use high powered binoculores to view the ufo as did my neighbors. I know for a fact it was not a conventinal aircraft of any kind. Lets just say I didn't sleep well that night. Seeing is believing. Sighting took place on 5-3-09 Between 10 and 10:30pm in Brooklyn Park MN near West Broadway and 85th Ave I lost sight of the ufo when it traveled west out of sight."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.34671","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16794.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16794_submitter_file1__16794_report_file2_sketch.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16794_submitter_file2__16794_report_file3_map.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16794_submitter_file3__16794_report_file4_map.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16794_submitter_file4__16794_report_file5_map.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16794_submitter_file5__16794_report_file6_map.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16794.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/03/2009 10:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Minnesota","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"45.101022","Case Number":"16794","City":"Brooklyn Park","Object Shape":"Diamond, Teardrop"}
