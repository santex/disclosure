THEY WERE TRYING TO POINT OUT THIS BLACK TRIANGLE IN THE SKY, AFTER A FEW SECONDS I BEGAN SEEING IT ALSO. I YELLED FOR MY WIFE, SHE CAME OUTSIDE WITH HER MOTHER AND WE POINTED IT OUT TO THEM. WE ALL SAW IT CLEARLY, IT MANUEVERED ABOUT BUT WAS GENERALY HEADING SOUTH. THERE WERE THREE FAIRLY DIM LIGHTS AT EACH CORNER, IT SEEMED TO BE A PERFECT TRIANGLE. AT MOMENTS YOU COULD PICK OUT THE EDGES OF IT BUT IT REALLY BLENDED IN WITH THE NIGHT SKY. IT WAS ABOUT AS LARGE AS MY HAND, I HAVE NO IDEA OF ITS ALTITUDE. IT DIDNT MAKE ANY SOUND, AND AFTER ABOUT TEN MINUTES IT FADED OUT. DURING THE OBSERVATION I TRIED CALLING SEVERAL FRIENDS IN THE AREA, BUT NONE OF THEM ANSWERED. MY KIDS KEPT ASKING IF IT WAS A UFO, I SAID IT WAS, BUT WE DONT NO IF ITS OURS OR FROM SOME PLACE ELSE. THE KIDS WERE NOT AFRAID UNTILL IT WAS OVER. THEY DIDNT WANT TO SLEEP ALONE THAT NIGHT. MY DAGHTERS ARE 12 AND 14."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"33.722244","Longitude":"-116.374456"}
