It was flying in a southeast direction. Flight was slow, and in a straight path. When it was directly overhead I stuck my head out of my window and saw it against the night sky. Perfect triangle shape. One white light on each corner, a red light in the middle. The rear two lights blinked in a non random pattern, the rest of the lights were non blinking. Attached is a quick illustration of what I saw. My opinion is that it was a military blimp type object. It had no regular FAA anti collision lighting configuration."],"Case Number":"33827","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
