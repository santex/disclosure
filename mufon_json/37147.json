{"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Silver with some glowing lights of blue and violet out one side. The other one was white.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting at the Bluewater Bridge custom's lineup. I was going to work in Port Huron from my home in Sarnia at 0830 on Monday, April 2, 2012. I caught a glimpse of an object off the corner of the customs building which was hovering. It was silver and gave off a couple of coloured lights from one side. I tried to find my phone to take a picture and when I looked back up, there were 2. The other one seemed either smaller or farther away and was a white orb. I had to go through customs and when I came out, they were gone. I never saw them leave. They were just gone. I was so excited, I couldn't wait to tell people."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04052012-0013","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Port Huron","There were no other sightings in Port Huron on or around April 2nd 2012"],"Object Shape":"Disc","Source":"MUFON","City":"Port Huron","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.980633,+-82.421544(37147)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37147) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"42.980633","Region":"Michigan","Case Number":"37147","Date Submitted":"04/05/2012 09:19 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37147.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37147.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-82.421544","Date of the Event":"04/02/2012 08:30 UTC"}
