{"Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was Operating a MAX train northbound along I205 and somewhere between Foster road and Powell Blvd I saw a woman with a stroller on the bike path that parallels the tracks holding up her phone, filming something in the sky. I looked and saw four spherical orbs in a chevron formation traveling southbound just south of Portland, Oregon. The orbs were much larger than aircraft warning lights and were perfectly spaced from one another. It looked like they were traveling south above the river valley. They were moving as fast as, if not faster than an airplane. Unfortunately I was only able to look for about five to ten seconds before I lost sight due to my direction of travel and my responsibilities involving the safe operation of the train."],"City":"Portland","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Chevron, Sphere","Longitude":"-122.672967","Case Number":"34214","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oregon","trends":["There have been 158 other sightings in Portland","There were no other sightings in Portland on or around December 18th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"12/18/2011 07:15 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.527092,+-122.672967(34214)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34214) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34214.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34214_submitter_file1__photo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34214.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-12192011-0011","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"4 spherical orbs in a chevron formation travelling southbound just south of Portland, Oregon","Latitude":"45.527092","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"12/19/2011 07:42 UTC"}
