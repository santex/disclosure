She was in the backyard looking north walking our little dog. Object was glowing white light, looked like a dinner plate with blue lights around the edge. Moved in a south eastern direction toward a red light in the sky. Greg saw: A white light moving in a southeasterly direction. Movement was not like any know aircraft or animal or balloon. It is more a wobble that a floating flight pattern. Shot a video. Did not like the quality decided to snap a still but forgot to turn off flash. When the flash went off the object suddenly seemed far away and dim. Thought the reddish light was a star or Mars, but as we began to study it began to ascend higher and higher into the sky until you could hardly see it. Toni and the neighbor observed flashes of light resembling lightning going to and from light. Also noticed an interruption in wireless internet at the onset of the episode"],"Log Number":"US-08052009-0016","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","City":"Spring","Date Submitted":"07/26/2009 10:20 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.08109,+-95.41264(18500)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18500) map </A>"}
