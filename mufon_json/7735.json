I heard the story when I was young, and I asked her about it when she was in her 80's (1999). This happened in the early 50's and I can't give a date. One night in the early 50's she couldn't sleep. She got up and sat by a window looking out (SE). She saw a large round light come down out of the sky and hover over a neighbors house. It sat there for some time. I asked her why she didn't wake my father, and she said I was just stairing at it. Then it just lifted up into the sky and vanished. She said that in the local news paper (The Daily Republican) the next day there was a story about a man walking his dog. The news paper story said that this guy was walking his dog in the middle of the night in Mont Clair, and he saw a bright light over Hallmans Hill (my parents neighborhood). His discription was the same as my mother. I guess people thought he was nuts, but to my mother it verified her story."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7735.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7735.html"],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"40.130382","Date of the Event":"06/01/1953 02:00 UTC"}
