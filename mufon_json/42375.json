I first thought it was a plane, but realized to was much too big to be a light on a plane, then I saw the second orb. It seemed to come from the same place from the northwest and took the same path across the sky, disappearing above where I stood, a bit to the north. I saw five of the bright red orbs, each following the same trajectory and each fading out or maybe moving away from me at about 85 degrees from the horizon. It occured to me that they were probably just paper lanterns, but they were so bright and definitely red. I was surprisingly unexcited by their appearance. They really seemed to all travel the same slow pace, same path, size and brightness. Its not impossible that the orbs I saw were just elaborate lanterns, but I choose to think not."],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"09/03/2012 12:00 UTC","Region":"Washington","Longitude":"-122.325257","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Mt Vernon","There were no other sightings in Mt Vernon on or around September 3rd 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"42375","Tags":"City"}
