At first it was flashing in a circular motion and then solid red and a blinking light on the bottom. It was moving NW at a slow rate of speed and just took off like nothing I have seen. At first I thought that it may have been a plane, since I live close to a small airport, and I see planes all day coming and going. Plus I see planes coming and going from the Pittsburgh Airport. I was so fixated on the object that I was entreged by it that I didn't get my video camera. Which upseted me."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/10/2012 09:51 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42456.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42456.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/10/2012 10:15 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Oval","Latitude":"41.209112","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.209112,+-77.186245(42456)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42456) map </A>","Longitude":"-77.186245","Summary":"extremely bright red lights, flashing then solid color with one blinking red light on bottom","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-09102012-0028"}
