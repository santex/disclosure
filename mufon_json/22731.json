Just 2 nights ago, our entire family witnessed these same lights. They appeared again tonight at about the same time, but this time there were only 2, not 4, extremely bright diamond shaped lights. This time they hovered lower and a bit closer than last time, according to my daughter. I have a feeling they will be making more appearances in this area.
