It looked to be at about 2000��� and was around 470 and the outskirts of Lakewood, CO. I first noticed the object as it looked like the aircraft on approach to DIA. It was stationary against the mountains in the West. However, the object did not change in altitude, or course over the 2 minutes that I saw it. It was strobing fairly rapidly, like what Stan Romanek had described in his observations around this area. It was white and then had a couple of bursts of small red orbs coming from it. It then just vanished from sight after a minute of observation. I have seen objects similar to this about once a month around Lakewood since fall 2008. I am sure there are several every night in this area, but I only see them every month."],"Date of the Event":"04/06/2009 08:17 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash"}
