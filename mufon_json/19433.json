It was similar to a upside down ice cream cone with a lght on top. It was a white light. There were no colors. The bright light at the top of the cone faded leaving the cone itself. Then the cone faded as well. The object was stationary. About 45 minutes later I saw a bright light that blinked slowely at an irregular pace moving north to south across the sky. It did not appear to be a plane because the light was very bright and blinked slowely - about three times - then it disappeared. This light was also white - no colors."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19433.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19433.html"],"Tags":"City"}
