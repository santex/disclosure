(but to this day i have seen another strange light appear in the sky out of no where huge ball of light in one spot, slowley start to dim but as its dimming its starts flying east like the light slowley turned off like a (dimmer)). thanks for letting me share my expearience with mufon i will try to get you all a video."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Marfa","There were no other sightings in Marfa on or around July 21st 2005"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
