I was looking west and saw at the tree lines what looked like an orange orb. At first thought it was an orange Japanese lantern. Then when I went upstairs looked out another window looking west and it moved at a faster rate than what I had originally thought and realized that this wasn't a lantern. Put son in his bed and looked out another window over Lake Lansing looking southward. And it went moving at a very fast motion and went upward into cloud and disappeared out of my sight."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Haslett","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49619.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49619.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Orange Orb came from west observed at tree line and the turned south over lake and ascended upward into cloud and disappeared"}
