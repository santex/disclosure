I seen multiple meteor on the night of the sighting. I looked up at the sky to pick a destination to line my telescope to, I then noticed a solid light slowy moving across the sky. When i lookd harder i noticed it had a triangle shape. Out the corner of my eye i noticed a similar craft. I then relized there was atleast 4 similar looking objects moving in different directions. I then heard a slight pulseing soud i then noticed a flashing cylinder object fall straight down in the north east horizon.
