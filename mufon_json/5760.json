Did you get to the dental appt. on time? When you posted later that you couldn't see the two figures I was a bit puzzled. Two tan colored creatures plainly hiding behind the two trees in your front yard. The one on the right has a glowing right hand. Makes me wonder about Right V.S. Left handedness in their species. At the time you took that blurry photo the glowing hand is extended in your direction and stopped glowing. The entity on the left is harder to see in your first photo. By adding sharpness three times the outline of a head, shoulder and arm became visible in your blurry photo. I used Irfanview to save the MSPaint files as Jpeg format. Sorry I didn't outline them for you earlier. With regards to JC's comment: In my experience the only people who truly fear having their photos taken are criminals."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-85.597474","City":"Undisclosed"}
