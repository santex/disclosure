It stopped, and some small little lighted spheres started to surround it then they scattered into different directions,I tried to focus on just a few,so as to remember what I was seeing, then it continued,again moving very slowly. Since this isnt the first time I witnessed something I trained myself to remain calm and remember what I am looking at. I just cant stop talking about it,or get it off my mind ! The spheres took off and disappeared, but the bus,I described it,kept moving slowly along."],"Longitude":"-88.017873","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"05/31/2004 08:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/31/2004 08:00 UTC","Country":"United States"}
