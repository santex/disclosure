I thought it was an airplane getting ready to land but then one of the lights turned off and seconds later the other light turned off, the second light turned back on about 10 seconds later only to turn back off about a second later. When I got home I decided to scan the sky when I saw and airplane and what I thought to be another airplane. The object that I thought was an airplane started to strobe and appeared to be very fast when another object appeared next to it and was also strobing. The second object became behind the first object and a third one appeared behind the second one. All three were flying in a straight line to the east and kept going straight. I called a friend and told her to go outside and she said she could only see one object and that it appeared to be going up into the sky and said it dissappeared about 3 minutes later."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"3 strobe like lights in straight line going west.
