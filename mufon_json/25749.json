{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy brother was out on his lawn talking on the phone. He stated that he saw several slow moving lights (approximately 20) moving east across the sky. His wife was in the living room and saw the lights from the window. They were approximately 100 feet in the air and were the size of a pilates ball.
