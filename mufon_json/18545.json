Followed by 3 more shortly after.","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were heading home at 10 pm from a friend's. I told my husband to look in the sky to the north - there were 3 orange lights in the sky. My husband commented that that was a weird color for stars to be. I jokingly said that they were probably UFO's. We pulled into our driveway about 30 seconds later. I told him to look up again, as there were 3 more balls making their way northward behind our house. My heart was pounding in my chest...I had never seen anything so unusual in the night sky before. A car had stopped just down the street from us. When they saw us looking at the balls, they drove up to the end of our driveway and asked if we had seen the orange balls, too. There was no noise associated with them. I took a picture with my cell phone, but it is faint. The balls continued north until they disappeared from view. I called the local police department to see if anyone else had reported seeing anything in the sky, but the dispatcher said no one else had called in."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/08/2009 10:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08082009-0015","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Wolverine Lake","There were no other sightings in Wolverine Lake on or around August 8th 2009"],"Object Shape":"Sphere"}
