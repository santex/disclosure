I always look up at the stars at night whenever im leaving from somewhere, see if anything is out of the ordinary and this time Im sure I did. I was looking from N to Swhen I saw a white light just pulsating but not moving. At first I thought it was star as ususal but I started to remember never seeing one in that direction at 7 p.m ET. Then it started moving going W and then it diverted to the NE almost overhead of me but not exactly. It wasnt moving too fast but it was faster then any aircraft ive heard or seen and I was constantly trying to find any aircraft collsion lights but there were none. It was just an orb with a bit of a aura to it but it was pretty far up in the sky. Once it passed over me and my brother we look back south where it was originally and this plane started heading N where the ufo path was going and the plane was loud and the other aircraft made absolutely no sound."],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","City":"Richmond","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Source":"MUFON"}
