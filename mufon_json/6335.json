Last night at around midnight I was watching TV when I happened to glance out the window and there was a bright orange oval shaped thing in the sky behind the trees, and it was traveling in the direction of my house. It could not have been a meteor, it was too bright and too slow. And it seemed to travel up, not down. I got too scared to walk outside and see where it was going."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6335.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6335.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Atascadero","Case Number":"6335","Summary":"BRIGHT ORANGE LIT UP THE SKY","Log Number":"US-02072007-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.492497,+-120.666656(6335)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6335) map </A>","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Atascadero","There were no other sightings in Atascadero on or around February 6th 2007"],"Latitude":"35.492497","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-120.666656","Date of the Event":"02/06/2007 11:30 UTC"}
