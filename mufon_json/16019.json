{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMarch 10th, 2009 at and between the times of 9:23pm to9:27pm, this is what I saw and my report. I thought it was any ordinary Jet approaching from the south of me. It had two white lights on each side from this front view. It was about the same size of an ordinary jet perhaps larger. I dismissed it. But nothing else was flying in the area so I watched it comes towards me with 10x50 Bushnell binoculars . It went over at about a 12:30 position above me, at about 3,000 feet. It had no sound what so ever, this alarmed me that it was not a ordinary air craft. It had no lights on the bottom, just the two side white side lights. It did have a very short exhaust or vapor trail, perhaps a third of the width of the craft. After it passed over me, I noticed it had two lights near the center and above the level of the two outside white light. The two lights seemed very small and pin point, but intense. The two center lights were off set at about a 45 degree angle, with the red light higher than the white one. They were blinking one at a time. At this time I tried to take a picture to get pattern of the lights on the rear of this craft. My digital camera would not work. I pushed the shutter button repeatedly. My camera isn���t very good at night. It was getting to far away so I abandon the camera. I quickly looked through my binocular that are mounted on a tripod. I quickly found it and I watched it go out by the airport. Where it appeared to stop after it slowed down. It speed up then slowed down and then speed up and then slowed down and moved NNW out of sight. The next day I called the airport and they told me the height of the jets at my address upon approach to land. They told me they would look into this matter and said he believed me. During the time this craft was above me, I should have been able to see what was in between the two lights, But I only saw a white mass, no shape. On regular airplanes I can see the fuselage, wings etc from all the way across the valley. On my March 5th sighting, I think this is the same craft that was NE of downtown Salt Lake City. It stayed above the mountain range motionless for 15 plus minutes before taking off and going north. From the rear view it seemed to have the same light pattern."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/10/2009 09:23 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/10/2009 09:23 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in West Valley City","There was one other sighting in West Valley City on or around March 10th 2009"],"Region":"Utah","Log Number":"US-03142009-0016","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.699273","City":"West Valley City","Longitude":"-111.99445","Summary":"Silent running craft passes over me, in SLC, UT.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"16019","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.699273,+-111.99445(16019)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16019) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16019.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16019.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
