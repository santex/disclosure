{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw a UFO in San Antonio, Texas on May 22, 2012 at 11:59 p.m. between Wurzbach and Huebner and Vance Jackson and IH10. At first I thought my neighbors had gotten a motion detector light but it didn't make sense to me why a light was actually shining right on me (like a spotlight). I looked up and saw what I thought to be at first a helicopter search light...but then I noticed there was no noise. The object was round and about half the size of a full moon with a slight orange outline. It was moving very quickly across the sky (not as fast as a commercial airplane and much faster than a helicopter. The white light and object were extraordinary...like what you see when iron is so hot it turns brilliant white. It seemed like it was only about 200-300 feet above me. I ran out into the yard to get a better look and it was no longer in the path it had been traveling (West to North) and had disappeared."],"Tags":"City","City":"San Antonio","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There was one other sighting in San Antonio on or around May 22nd 2012"],"Log Number":"US-05232012-0064","Summary":"Shined spotlight on me.
