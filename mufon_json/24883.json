(it is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its' appearance and proximity to the green object.) the green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. it did not just blink off but seemed to ���power down���. at 2202 hrs i saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. they performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color. they too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark. i checked the heavens above website and discovered that there were no iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings."],"Source":"MUFON"}
