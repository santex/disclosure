It appeared to have a tail and was moving in a small loop. It was brighter than a star and had a reddish tint to it, sometimes blue.. It appeared to be bouncing off of the atmosphere, we thought it could be a comet or something, possibly headed into the atmoshere. another thought was that it could be an alien-craft or perhaps an ICBM missile. About 45 min. later I spotted a second one. it was moving much slower but doing the same thing.."],"Summary":"2 star like objects.
