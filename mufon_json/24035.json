First I thought it could be the beacon of an airplane, but the lack of noise typical of an aircraft and the path that the light was always straight with small but sudden movements to the sides made it clear to me that it could not be a plane. The object followed their path in the sky in absolute silence at a height of approximately 200 meters to go away from my field of vision. i observed it for about 7 minutes"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Oliveira","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"Brazil","Log Number":"BR-06302010-0002","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Latitude":"-20.697051","City":"Oliveira","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
