But there is another star also appeared between the distance of Moon and Jupiter such that its lights so strange and it moves slowly from South to North direction and stops hovering above our home in Anaheim - nearby to Disneyland. I looked at the watch and it showed 10:54PM. The pulsating lights around its perimeter generated the aurora halo-like with Red, Amber, Blue lights that expended and retracted around its object. Around 15 seconds later it started to move back towards its Jupiter side and we get lost it. The strange object was not high in the sky when we saw it but it moves higher thereafter. The strange thing is that it made a U-turn in front of our eyes. We hope that many others who live in Orange County area could see it and to verify what we saw. Total observe time is around 4 minutes. I do have camera with me but there is no good to take its pictures at this nighttime and high up in the sky."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.844293,+-117.911734(25571)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25571) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-117.911734","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
