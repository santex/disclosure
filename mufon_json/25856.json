It occasionally drifted and would bend in on itself, floating like an extremely large balloon. I saw several planes and a hot air balloon aloft at the same time, but I really couldn't get a good idea of distance or size, although it was certainly large and not all that far off. I was able to round up some more witnesses, and we watched for about 50 minutes as it drifted around the sky, occasionally changing color from black to silver, which may have been due to sunlight hitting its surface. It drifted north northwest along the Rio Grande, and we observed it until it was barely visible anymore. When close, we could not discern any distinguishable characteristics. It was a long line, probably cylindrical or tubelike, and just black. None of us have any idea as to what it could have been, but I'm sure there were plenty of witnesses besides those of us at the Botanical Gardens."],"Date of the Event":"10/13/2010 09:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Case Number":"25856","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cylinder"}
