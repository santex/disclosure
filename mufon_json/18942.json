It appeared to be two shades of dark gray and black I would say circular in shape but I guess it was the bottom that I saw and it was not flat it had indentations. I turned down Moss Mill to get a better look but it was gone. I looked all over and wondered if I really saw what I thought I saw. I also thought to myself why arent I scared."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Other","Latitude":"39.488333","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18942.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18942.html"],"Region":"New Jersey","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/26/2009 01:00 UTC","Summary":"UFO.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Unknown","Log Number":"US-08292009-0006","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/26/2009 01:00 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Galloway","There were no other sightings in Galloway on or around August 26th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18942","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.488333,+-74.475556(18942)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18942) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None"}
