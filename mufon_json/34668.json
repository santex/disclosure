I had never heard of \"Chemtrails\". Thought we were under attack. Although I never saw or heard the 'anomalies\", this is the raw photo of 5 UFO's, that just happened to zip by as I shot the pictures of these chemtrails. I was using a telephoto lens. It took me over a week to see them..... I never noticed they were there on the day that I took these shots. I have already posted some photos to your mufon Utah site. Check them out there as it took a long time to upload them to that site and I don't want have to do that again. My gut feel is that they are some kind of military next generation drones with an advanced propulsion system."]}
