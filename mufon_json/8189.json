It was a totally clear day. No clouds in the sky. We noticed a shiny, metallic object just sitting in the sky just to the northwest of the amphitheater. It was about a quarter the size of a dime held at arms length. It did not move and appeared to just hang there. As best we could determine it was a cylinder shape, like a pop can. Others around us noticed us looking at it and joined in with speculation on what it might be. There must have been about 10-20 people who saw it in the rows around immediately around us. It did not move and sat there for about 30 minutes. We kept a pretty constant eye on it and I remember looking down for a few seconds and when I looked up it was gone. Nobody around us saw what happened to it."]}
