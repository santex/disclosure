I immediately IM'ed my mom on FB and told her about it and she said for me to make sure it wasn't the stealth bomber. I couldn't disrupt my class so I kept my mouth shut as everyone whould have laughed. IT wasn't the stealth, it was going to slow then it was gone. I go to air shows and I have never seen anything like this except one time at night when my mom seen a triangle but I only seen the end of it going west. This thing today was going north over hwy 31 and I was close. I wonder if anyone else seen this. I keep up on my aircraft cause my Grandpa was a pilot in the AirForce and planes really interest me. IF this was one of our's, I want to fly it someday. I make fun of my mom and this UFO stuff but today kinda made me think.."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.050385","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Westfield","There were no other sightings in Westfield on or around April 14th 2010"],"Log Number":"US-04142010-0013","City":"Westfield","Date of the Event":"04/14/2010 02:11 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/14/2010 03:21 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22822.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22822.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-86.122249","Case Number":"22822"}
