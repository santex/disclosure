I watched it for about a minute then went inside my house to get my camcorder. I recorded the object for a few minutes then went back inside to get my wife. When we came out just a minute later the object was gone. We witnessed a very similar object here at our home on the night of July 4, 2008. The object was fairly high and seemed to be moving slowly to the west. The total time I witnessed this object was around 5 minutes. We are about 5 miles southeast of Baton Rouge, LA."],"Summary":"Very Bright Object Seen in Western Sky in Baton Rouge","Date Submitted":"09/09/2008 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09132008-0001","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
