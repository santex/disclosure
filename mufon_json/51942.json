It was still light out. I was on Rezanof St. heading toward Benny Benson when I noticed movement from a black object over the tree tops just about over the Mission Beach area. I turned left on Benny Benson and pulled over on Mission Rd. to get a better view. Two people came out of a house to their vehicle. I pointed it out to them. They asked me if it was a person.I told them I had no idea. It headed out over the ocean. I drove over to Mission Beach and parked. I called my husband at home. Our home overlooks the water. I watched it until it was almost a dot. I went home. My husband saw it with binoculars and watched it until it was out of sight. It headed straight out to sea. There is nothing out there but open water. You could pick out what appeared to be two legs and two arms held out in front. When it was at the correct angle. At first it appeared to be facing somewhat south but then it turned a bit and headed out to sea."],"Longitude":"-152.399872","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=57.79913,+-152.399872(51942)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51942) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/18/2013 08:32 UTC"}
