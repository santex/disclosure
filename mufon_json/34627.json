After our eyes had adjusted we could see dim stars that weren't visible befor. We noticed at about the same time nearly directly above us there were seven very dim red lights,they looked like very small red stars hovering for about a minute. We both made comments about them then five flew off to the north and two went to the south overtaking each other in a slightly zig zag pattern almost like they were playing. Both of us observed the two until we couldn't see them any more,not that they shot off they just got to dim, don't know what the other five did .They did get up to speed pretty quick. I don't know if we have anything that can hover that high up or why seven air craft would meet up like that then go separate ways. It is annoying because I don't think I will ever know what they were but I can be sure we both saw something strange that night just wish I had a definitive answer."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"34627","City":"Cranbourne North","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-38.074706,+145.276093(34627)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34627) map </A>","Region":"Victoria","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"145.276093","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Cranbourne North","There were no other sightings in Cranbourne North on or around July 8th 2005"],"Latitude":"-38.074706","Country":"Australia","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
