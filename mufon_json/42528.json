It hovered approximately 20 minutes then winked out and disappeared. It reappeared briefly for about 5 minutes then disappeared. Both times it was stationary, emitting a reddish light that seemed to spin or reflect around the diameter of the object. Also in the sky was a reddish object that was stationary as well. It was reddish in color and seemed to be reflective.My thought is that it might be Mars or Venus. Before during and after I observed planes, going in the southeast direction in the same general area of the sky. This is the second time i have seen these two objects.Possibly a third time as well in the last three months. all these sightings occurred on my porch of my house."]}
