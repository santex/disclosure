Thought it might have been a comet or asteroid, but the direction seemed wrong as it appeared to be heading almost straight across the sky. The entire object was the shape of a cigar with a glowing red nose like a fireball and then a smokey short tail, about 5 x the size of a jet that if one had been in the same area and it was moving slower. If I was to estimate I saw it for at least 1 minute before it disappeared, it could have just gone behind the trees but I moved around the house to see if I could spot it again, but to no avail."],"Date Submitted":"01/29/2012 01:36 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Country":"Canada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35333.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35333.html"],"Longitude":"-127.643751","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Cigar like with bright glowing red nose like a fireball and smokey short tail could have been a comet, but heading with a slight decent across the sky line, slower than a jet and then disappeared","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
