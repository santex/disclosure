I was driving between 65 and 70 mph. I was just at the Junipero Exit at San Juan Capistrano, CA, when I saw a round dark spot (1) in the sky above the cars, farther up the freeway. The spot grew bigger. It was coming in my direction. Then it appeared to be a blimp (2), just off to the left, over the South bound lanes. It was shiny silver looking. Then it sped by so fast and I thought that���s no blimp, a blimp can���t go that fast. It seemed like a bullet whizzing by. I was shocked! I guessed its speed at maybe 200 mph and about 200 feet in the air. It was bullet shaped and highly polished steel or chrome. It had a double band around the middle with dots along the side, from top to bottom. It was moving South, in a direct line. It moved at unbelievable speed. It appeared as a bullet shape yet somewhat round on both ends and about 20-30 feet long. For a second I thought it might be a missile. Then I thought it could be a drone, but it was moving so fast, how could it record anything? It had no wings and no Gondola like on a blimp. What can fly that fast with no wings? This only took about 3 seconds, from seeing the spot (1) to looking like a blimp (2) to having it speed past me (3). My process time was this: What is that? Oh is it a blimp? No way! As it zipped past me on my left. I estimated the speed, size and height based on the cars travelling south, that were probably doing about 70 mph and this object zoomed past them in a second. I immediately called JT on my cell phone to tell him what I just saw. My call is recorded at 4:53 PM. I then hung up. I was just merging onto the 73 Toll-road and then I exited at La Paz. I parked in my Dr.s parking garage. I called JT again at 5:04 to tell him more about what I saw. I have searched the local news but there is no report of what I saw, so I am reporting this now."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"47486","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"05/14/2013 04:52 UTC","Latitude":"33.520245","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.666681","Summary":"Fast moving shiny bullet/missle object over 5 Fwy headed South.","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.520245,+-117.666681(47486)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47486) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
