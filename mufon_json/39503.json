I saw a large bright orange light fading in an out about 400 ft above the freeway an about 300 ft ahead of me. I slowed down as did the car next to me, it was stationary so as I drove under it, it looked to me like a ball of fire. It was extremely bright a portion of it was red an I saw actual flames, but at the same time the light was fading in an out. It then took off south bound horizontal over the freeway. I got off at Oxnard as it was 50 ft in front of me turned right, it was now 15 miles from me an watched the light turn into a small spec an then disappeared."]}
