{"Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07172007-0003","Summary":"Saw a triangular shaped object fly past in a east to west direction","City":"Northlake","Region":"Illinois","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my way to a local store on an errand, as I usually do I take my digital camera with me (I recently took amateur photgraphy) on the way there I was snapping photos of the area as it looks at night for an online photo album. As I came home I had my attention diverted to the sky and there I saw a triangular shaped object silenty going along. The lights on it were very visable and since there was a little bit of light still in the sky you could make out a very dull black color. I took pictures of the object and will include them if requested. This is not the first time I have seen this object, but have kept it to myself, although this is the first time I have had the chance to take pictures of the object."],"Date Submitted":"07/14/2007 10:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.917253,+-87.895618(7469)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7469) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7469.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7469_submitter_file1__triangle.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7469_submitter_file2__Pictures285.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7469_submitter_file3__Pictures305.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7469.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/14/2007 10:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-87.895618","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Northlake","There were no other sightings in Northlake on or around July 14th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"7469","Latitude":"41.917253"}
