It not that surrounded by houses because we own a farm. As I was laying on my grass half way to sleep (because I usually do that) I thaught my borther was shining light against my face and so I got mad at him and I wanted to punch him but i found out that he wasn't there. I saw to the sky and there was this big triangle object and it looked like if it was pretty close. I just started to freak out and I was speachless. Since I was alone in my dads farm I had no idea what to do. I wanted to call someone police department but they were going to think that i was crazy. Well I was about 3 mins away from my house and I didn't know what to do but just stay still so maybe they wont see me. The light turned off just by a little when it was in the middle and that was when my heart literally felt like if it was pounding. They stood there for a few seconds and they it fanished like a flick of an eye.. PLease help me I really do need help.
