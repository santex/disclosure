It started in the West and moved to the East (over the course of 1-3 minutes) at what looked like a higher altitude than a plane but maybe a satellite but what convinced me it wasn't a satellite was when it went to the East and slowly disappeared, losing its glow and turning into a pinpoint of a light before disappearing. I witnessed this myself while my girlfriend and one of my best friends walked to the store together. When they got back they, without me asking or prompting them, asked me if I had seen the same thing."],"Latitude":"47.044304","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Olympia","There were no other sightings in Olympia on or around August 19th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.044304,+-122.896485(50017)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50017) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08202013-0001","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/19/2013 10:19 UTC"}
