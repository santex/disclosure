a white\\orange star. the second object was below it an slightly to the left. the two objects did not move at this time. they hovered there for a moment. then, they began to move together towards the sky, as if moving straight up, still very, very slowly, as if they were hovering. i asked some other boe employees if they could see it, but they all ignored me except for a young lady who said she couldn't see it though i pointed right at it. she thought i was crazy. i then noticed that i was out there for 20 minutes, which is over the 15 minutes allotted for my break. i didn't want to go back upstairs, partly because i was fascinated, and because my office faces the south. i was so angry with myself for leaving my iphone upstairs at my desk, because i wanted to take a picture of it. i came back downstairs about 45 minutes later and tried to find them but the objects were gone. after work i immediately rode my bike to the sacramento river levee where there is a clear, 360 degree view of the sky, but could not see anything but planes taking off and landing at the airport and some birds. when i came home i called the local news channel, kcra 3 news and asked if anyone had reported a ufo sighting. they told me no and told me they were not interested in a ufo story. during and after the event, i felt a strong sence of fear, joy, confusion and curiosity. mostly confusion and fear. my muscles were shaking and could not get the thought of the objects out of my head. i was not very productive the next hour and a half at work. i still have feelings of fear now and chills go down my spine thinking about it. curiously, i had a dream about seeing a ufo the night before, and when i woke up i noticed that my watch, which is analogue and tells you the day and the date was incorrect. i compulsively check my watch, and it did read thursday, but instead of the 14th it read the 15th. it read wednesday the 13th the day before. i don't know if it is a sign of something or it was just some kind of funky mix up with my watch and coincidence i dreamt about a ufo. i am still frightened and confused and have this strange compulsion to look up onto the sky to the north-west. i cannot explain what it was, or why no one else noticed it. it was so clearly visible. it was real."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"25903","Country":"United States","Region":"California","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There was one other sighting in Sacramento on or around October 14th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25903.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25903.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"38.587542","Date Submitted":"10/14/2010 10:25 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
