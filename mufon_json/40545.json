We were about 2 hours into our observation period, looking north, when one of us turned around (facing south) and saw a very large, bright light. The light seemed to be positioned over the south end of the Bradshaw Mountains, although it was difficult to perceive exactly where and at what elevation (although it was certainly west of Interstate 17). What immediately struck us was its size ��� it seemed to be above a large part of the southern end of this large mountain range. It was very bright, shaped like a narrow, stretched oval and was motionless. We stood mesmerized, afraid to get a camera or binoculars lest it disappear. Within a minute or two, a large, solid light formation, emanated from the stationary horizontal light, moving slowly downward towards what we perceived as ground. This downward moving solid light was similar in width to the main horizontal light above. The horizontal light remained and did not change. When the downward moving light reached what we perceived as solid ground, it then reversed its direction and traveled upward, as a solid light formation, slowly back to the main horizontal light. When it reached the horizontal light, the latter slowly turned into a huge blue ball. When the ball formed, it immediately started to vaporize ��� the blue ball started to disappear, turning into wisp-like clouds. Eventually (a minute or two) the blue ball completely disappeared and all that was left was the cloud-like bodies. After another minute or two, eventually these disappeared too, until nothing was left. We were dumb-founded. Although we continued our plant research observations through the night, we talked of our more interesting light sighting non-stop. The sighting was a phenomenal occurrence for me, forever changing my life."],"Date Submitted":"07/07/2012 04:14 UTC","Case Number":"40545","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40545.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40545.html"],"City":"Phoenix"}
