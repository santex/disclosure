Looked up at it, and it was making zig zag lines for approximately three minutes. When tried to take a picture of it with a cell phone camera, it disappeared completely, leaving a green streak of light. During the time that it was zig zagging, it moved very quickly, but remained in one short space. Looked around for a few minutes afterward in all directions to try to relocate it, but could not find it or anything similar to it anywhere else in the visible sky."],"Latitude":"41.258313","City":"Omaha","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Omaha","There were no other sightings in Omaha on or around August 18th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"18807","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.258313,+-95.994098(18807)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18807) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"08/18/2009 11:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-95.994098","Object Features":"None","Region":"Nebraska"}
