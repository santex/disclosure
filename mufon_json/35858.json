{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"25.478183","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details On February 16, 2012 Thursday at approximately 4:40 am EST. I observed through my security camera system a massive star-like object that descended horizontally from a 45 degree angle in the night sky and as it did it divided itself into 8 other smaller oval shaped star-like objects glowing with the same intensity and pulsating as they descended so low on the east due east that were no longer in my security camera system line of sight. I have been in the military and in the civilian law enforcement for over 10 years combined and I have never seen a drop of flares that would perform as these lights did. If it was a night-op from the near by Air Force Base performing a drop on some experimental flares, can anyone inform of such event? Thank you.
