I started walking several hundred yards it Ry back to my car and had a rather strange feeling come over me that I was being watched, I figured this was due to me being alone, which I do alot of fishing in the middle of the night in secluded areas by my home, anyhow I was walking to my car through some brush and trees and off to my right across the river from me I saw that the hillside had been illuminated with a vary dim light, as I got closer to my car which was parked on the levy road next to the river I saw that there was an object grey and white with minor reflective surface also a dim glow, it was hovering about 50 feet above the water with no sound coming from it and was the size of a large SUV then it shot off at a vary high speed to my side of the river aprox 100 feet from where I was standing, my immediate response was absolute devistating fear so I grabbed my handgun and got into my car and began to drive away. The object began to follow alongside my car over the river I remember vividly going 80mph down the dirt road, the object stayed perfectly level as it got behind me I could see it in my rearview mirror it chased me for about two miles before breaking away in the oppisite direction. Still to this day I do not return to that spot especially at night and im goping to figure out what it was so that I can find closure and I hope by not keeping it to muself I might gain some closure...... My thought is its military aircraft but still doesnt change the frear aspect"],"Latitude":"33.622753","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43321.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43321.html"],"Log Number":"US-10172012-0007","Object Features":"Other"}
