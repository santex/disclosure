We saw one, then two, then three and they all blinked out at once. Then we saw three again much further to the west. They also blinked out at the same time. Then we saw one light appear, then two, three, four, five, six and seven until there were seven in a row in the sky. They all disappeared at the same time. My husband said we just saw a UFO!
