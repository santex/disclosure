We left los angeles about 430 am, at about 6am, we started making our way west on hwy 166 in central ca, it was still very dark, and hwy 166 is a very desolate country road, i noticed up ahead about half a mile, a flashing brilliant blue light, i thought it was just. A light a farmer attached to a pole, as i got closer to it i realized the orb was about the size of a vw bug, i was driving about 60 mph, when i reached the orb, it was about 20 ft off the ground to my left, it stopped flashing for a second or two, then started flashing again, but is was now about 100 ft in the air following my truck, then it shot over my truck, and was now to the right of me, i looked to my wife, and said, im glad your here, so i have a wittness, then the orb went black for about two seconds, then reappeared about half a mile behind me, this is the first time iv ever seen anything like this, im a licensed pilot, and i know what navigation lights look like, and i know how things fly, but iv never seen anything shoot straight up, then move side to side like this blue object, it was truly unidentified, hope this report helps, thanks, tony in los angeles"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-11232011-0004","Date Submitted":"11/23/2011 07:29 UTC","Summary":"witnesses bright blue flashing ufo on hwy 166 in central ca","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.030708,+-119.002424(33550)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33550) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Region":"California","Country":"United States","City":"Bakersfield","Latitude":"35.030708","Longitude":"-119.002424","Case Number":"33550","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 32 other sightings in Bakersfield","There were no other sightings in Bakersfield on or around October 31st 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/31/2011 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
