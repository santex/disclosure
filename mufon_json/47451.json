The light it gave off grew to an intensity that rivalled the moon (also in the sky) making the apparently size grow double before diminishing. I could see the ufo the entire time while it moved from South east to North west over my residence, which I then lost sight of it as it when over the building. Everytime I mentally suggested to flash it did. Very awe inspiring."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Randomly flashing orb with speed and directional changes","Tags":"City","Latitude":"46.312975","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47451.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47451.html"]}
