I noticed the object very shortly after the road travels upward and curves towards veterans parkway it was a clear morning and I saw this object fly right in front of my car it flew from NW at a rate of speed i have never seen before. I have seen a lot of shooting stars before and this one was no star. I have also flown in a lot of aircraft even military crafts because i'm stationed at HAAF here in Savannah. Now I've never Seen a Star change Direction when falling so i knew it was not a star or sattilite, i would have taken pictures or tryed to video it but like i said i was driving. The wierd thing is that it made me feel really fearful i said \" What the hell was that? \" I've never felt that way about a star falling and its also wierd that ever since I've been stationed here more and more of these things keep poping up around the installation. I lost sight of the object as it crossed over the river and it shot upward at first then stopped and shot to the SE. Oh and one more thing everytime it stopped and took off again it left like a trail of blue electricity tails."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.085541,+-81.093114(15124)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15124) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Summary":"What was that?","Date of the Event":"01/23/2009 06:10 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere, Teardrop","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15124.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15124.html"],"Log Number":"US-01252009-0006","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Savannah"}
