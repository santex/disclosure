She came and got me and I ran out and watched it for a brief moment then ran in to grab cell phone to video record it. It traveled behind the moon and it appeared as a bright light but in trianglular form. It traveled faster than a plane but made no sound and had no blinking lights. It was a clear sky with just moon out. It looked like a ball of light as it got further away traveling NE and then seemed to vier east.It continued over the town untill it was out of sight. We only saw it for a few minutes. The sighting left us in awe and bewildered. I wanted to get in my truck and follow it but didn't."],"Log Number":"US-06132011-0001"}
