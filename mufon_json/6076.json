I'm not the wierdo with a tinfoil hat seeing UFOs in every cloud, but I know what I saw. I saw a sphere of light, bright gold, and I have a picture to prove it. The creature didn't show up on the picture, but the creature was tall, skinny, and pink. When I turned away to see what time it was after I took the picture, the UFO rocketed up into the sky. And that's pretty much it."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Sphere of light with creature stepping out","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
