I noticed the object in low the sky, at first I thought it was the North Star it was so bright. Then I noticed the star had a metallic look to it, and had gotten brighter. Then I thought perhaps it was the sun reflecting off a plane. Impossible. It would have been an extremely large plane if thatd been the case. Strange enough it was as if this object knew it was being watched, it grew very bright, and then began to dim until it completely vanished. Ive seen many different craft in the New Castle area numerous times on different months and dates."]}
