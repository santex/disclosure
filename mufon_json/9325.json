ecm flares have no chutes and burn for a relatively short time, additionally they free fall and would normally have horizontal velocity components. i did a google search for orange flares to no avail. i am a 65 yo retired dod engineer with 10 years active duty usaf about 18 years dod. have had at least two and more than likely three other probable ufo incidents. i would be interested if any military or dod know of any orange flares that would be used by the military and why they would be deploy at such an extreme altitude. the orange balls appeared to be of a size such that i would estimate it would have taken 3 to 4 of them inline to go from edge to edge of the moon. my guesstimate is that the largest number of balls in view at any one time was 10 to 12. episode started with a single ball appearing in front of my windshield as if it had been uncovered; continued with them appearing and disappearing suddenly."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/23/2008 06:30 UTC","Longitude":"-75.273822","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9325.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9325.html"],"Latitude":"44.505061","City":"De Kalb Junction"}
