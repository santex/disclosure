{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","divs":["Sighting Detailstriangular two long sides rear was shorter. Gray in color. lights each corner and center, row of lights accross the rear . low close and very easy to see the details. moved sort of like a boat when turning. the lights change configuration several times. the triangular shape never changed, but the arangement of the lights would change and could easily fool someone into thinking it was a large plane or several planes in formation. Not your typical sighting, everthing was close, clear and detailed. could easily be something military. I was in traffic when my wife spotted it. we were watching it as we drove. it lasted atleast several minutes. I lost sight of it due to traffic."],"Date Submitted":"02/02/2012 01:41 UTC","Longitude":"-116.180506","City":"Coachella","Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California","Latitude":"33.673255","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.673255,+-116.180506(35405)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35405) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35405.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/20/2011 04:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-02022012-0002","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"35405","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Coachella","There were no other sightings in Coachella on or around December 20th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Summary":"triangular gray ufo with changing light configurations."}
