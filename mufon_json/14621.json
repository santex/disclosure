if so, it will be a new one to all of us here. if not, we haven���t the slightest idea as to what it may have been."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Extremely bright light, ball shaped, strobe on top, came out of nowhere, dropped straight down then headed east until gone.","City":"Mounds","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14621.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14621.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"12/29/2008 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
