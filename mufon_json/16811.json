Grissom AFB is close by so I am used to seeing aircraft. Never in my life have I seen anything in the sky like I witnessed that night. When I seen it I said aloud, Neat! While driving I noticed a single white strobing light, which is normal. All the sudden about six to eight horizonal lights in a row appeared in a straight line where the strobing light was. Then it dissapeared. Is there some new aircraft never before seen is the sky?"],"Case Number":"16811","Date of the Event":"04/18/2009 09:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
