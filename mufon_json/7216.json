All of the sudden as we have seen many times a star-like object was spotted moving south at a high rate of speed at a very high elevation mostlikly in space we assumed. as the object became in the southern area of view we noticed a plane that was flying very high in the western direction and as the object passed in front of and just seemingly higher altitude above the plane, the lights from the plane shined on the object seemed to alumintate it, I believe the object had been close enough to reflect the light from the airplane, I also wonder if the pilot saw it."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"06/13/2007 09:45 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-06142007-0002","Summary":"star-like moving southward at a hight rate of speed from center of sky seemingly to near miss a plane which was headed west","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.741484,+-104.978733(7216)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7216) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/13/2007 09:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around June 13th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
