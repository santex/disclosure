At first we thought it was a plane, but it glowed too much to be a plane. But it couldn���t be a star either because it was too low and too bright. We turned left as soon as we could and began traveling south to get a better view. I wanted to get a clearing so I could tape it with my flip video. Once we had a clear view, I stopped the car and began to film it. Another glowing object, blinking on and off appeared along side it. My cousin was kind of freaking out, but I was excited. So I took a quick video of Venus and Jupiter in the other part of the sky to show that is not what we saw. As bright as Venus and Jupiter were that night, they did not glow nearly as bright as these glowing lights. This is the second time I have seen something like that in the sky and taped it. It is also in the same general area in the sky at about the same time of night."],"trends":["There have been 56 other sightings in Detroit","There were no other sightings in Detroit on or around March 7th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Sighting Duration":"00:05:30","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","City":"Detroit","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-83.040304","Log Number":"US-03172012-0011","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
