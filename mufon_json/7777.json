I got my camera and set up my tripod in front of my house. Night photography needs longer exposure times without camera movement. I set the desired exposure and set the timer so I wouldn't shake the camera while taking the picture. Pressing the button and waiting 10 seconds for the camera to fire I would not be looking through the viewfinder. This photo was the longest exposure of the night at 4 seconds. You can see some of the movement of the stars with a small amount of streaking with a long exposure of 4 seconds. This object has a very defined pattern of lights and some visible structure."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","Region":"Ohio","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Centerville","There were no other sightings in Centerville on or around August 28th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.637613,+-84.157752(7777)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7777) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7777.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7777_submitter_file1__notsurewhatthisis.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7777.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/28/2007 05:50 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/28/2007 05:50 UTC","Longitude":"-84.157752","City":"Centerville","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"visible lights"}
