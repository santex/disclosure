It was a reddish color and was at high altitude. It was travelling slower than some of the aircraft in the area and was what made me believe it wasn't an airplane along with the absence of flashing lights. As I watched the object a second one appeared going from NE to SE on a different trajectory appearing to be at a lower altitude and travelling faster than the aircraft that was going NW to NE. After a few seconds the second object began to get brighter and I began to think it was a meteorite. It was way brighter than any of the lights on an aircraft. Then the light quickly dimmed back to it original intensity. During the time it brightened, I lost track of the first object. I cannot say where it went or anything. The second object continued on course and I lost contact with it after it became obscured by a neighbor's tree."],"Log Number":"US-08042011-0036","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Washington","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.305694,+-91.690695(30615)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30615) map </A>","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"41.305694","Date of the Event":"08/03/2011 10:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/04/2011 04:10 UTC","Summary":"2 Star-like objects over Washington, IA","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30615.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30615.html"],"Case Number":"30615","Object Features":"None","Region":"Iowa"}
