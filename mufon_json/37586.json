Fire and rescue teams were sent to investigate but found no debris or oil on the small lake and did no further investigation. The siting was reported on the local news network and in the newspapper. A meteor the size of a whale should have made enough noise to wake those who live on the lake. It would be nice to have someone perform an underwater search. The object was not described as on fire but just glowing."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Reported by state police officer from 10 miles away.","City":"Litchfield","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.725841,+-73.233946(37586)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37586) map </A>"}
