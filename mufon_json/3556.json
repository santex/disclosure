On the bottom was a red dome that emitted light in sinc with a low frequency,moduation. Like a weak station at the lower end of the f.m. dial,but loud,at 5 sec. apart. We watched it go down slowly behind Davis pond. There was little doubt what we saw. I called the Montville police and told them it was a small aircraft that crashed. An officer came in 10 min. we drove down Turner rd. and heard the humming from behind the sandpit. We walked threw the pit and around the swamp only to see at 100 ft,the object spewing out sparks,like carbon arc welding. we decided to leave , frightened. The officer did not report the indicent. For all I know, its still there! I've never gone back!"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Montville","There were no other sightings in Montville on or around July 31st 1987"],"Case Number":"3556","Source":"MUFON","City":"Montville","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/31/1987 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
