They have not been firing lights at anything at least. not sure why larger of two objects is hanging out, unless they are expecting the other unseen object back for some reason. this lasts from 3 to 4 hours and larger craft leaves about nine pm cst. it can be observed descemding below our visable horizon. while our local sometimes joins it. dont know whats going on but i will keep an eye on the sky for now and report anything else going on."],"Date Submitted":"03/04/2012 08:26 UTC","Summary":"large one is chevron shaped, smaller is a spere","Longitude":"-92.35462","City":"Washburn Mo","Sighting Duration":"03:30:23","Log Number":"US-03042012-0012","Tags":"City","Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36248.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36248.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Case Number":"36248"}
