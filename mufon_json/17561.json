It had a short tail behind it and lit up the clouds before vanishing. A couple minutes later I saw a bright star-like object falling slowly from the sky in almost the same location. It did not have any tail at all nor did it pulsate or burn up like a meteor would have. It just fell straight down almost to the ground before disappearing. I thought it was a pretty cool coincidence that it showed up right as I was thinking about aliens. It was almost like they were giving me a sign. Of course it could have just been a couple of meteors. Who knows?"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.098385,+-83.984666(17561)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17561) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17561.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17561.html"],"Region":"Ohio","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Case Number":"17561","Summary":"Bright green fireball followed by falling star.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
