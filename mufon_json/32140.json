I have a habit of looking at the sky and took notice of how bright Jupiter was. It was then that I noticed a red-orange orb floating in the north-eastern sky. It did not blink (had no navigational lights.) It glowed dimly. It was hard to focus on as it was very high in the sky and the street lights were obscuring my vision. I observed it fly, almost floating, until it was too small to see. It was definitely bigger than a star, not quite as bright, and moving very fast. I live near an air force base and know it was not a C130 (the aircraft native to the base) as they fly much, much lower than this object. I did not observe anything that looked structurally like a plane (wings, tail, etc.) It was just a solid orb. I did notice a helicopter and other various aircraft flying around (which is not unusual.)"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09272011-0016","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Little Rock","There was one other sighting in Little Rock on or around September 27th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arkansas","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"34.750701","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.750701,+-92.287605(32140)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32140) map </A>"}
