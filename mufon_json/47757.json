Outside just walking around the yard. A large fire ball approaching from the south to southeast. I did not know what the object could be so I stood and watched it. It stopped the fire around the object became larger. It seemed to burn for a short time, thirty to forty five seconds I would think. It started to drop balls of fire three total as they headed for the ground I never seen them go out. They went out of my field of view. I then turned my attention to the ball inn the sky. Shortly after the three balls had left it paused for a few seconds then it left at a great speed heading north northeast. I was amazed not afraid. I went in got my mother we stood out in the yard to see if it may return. But it never did. I have never told anyone until now about this. The craft or whatever it may be just went out of site."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"47757","Region":"Kentucky","Date Submitted":"05/31/2013 10:39 UTC","Longitude":"-84.174775","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47757.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47757.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Shape":"Fireball","City":"Winchester","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05312013-0007"}
