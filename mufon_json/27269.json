(i am sorta known for sky gazing - i think its so pretty.. clouds\\stars\\moon\\sunrise&set, all pretty.) it had been overcast past days before then and so the crisp clear sky was more noticable & special looking. the stars were really bright (for city sky) particularly orion, & moon was big (full moon & lunar eclipse just 2 days before).. i was in middle of pointing up & saying \"look how pretty\" to my friend, when i noticed that one, a big bright reddish\\orange 'star', was moving upwards.. \"hey that ones moving\" i pointed & said after a moment. normally i pry wouldnt have pointed out some moving light in the sky.. we live in a valley w\\ a good amount of air traffic, & airplanes\\helicopters are no wonderous thing to take note of. (thats one thing that leads me to believe it wasnt normal.. it wasnt like i was conscious of it 'not being' normal vehicle, i just sort of instinctually automatically knew it was something else.) we watched it move upwards towards orions belt in the sky (im bad a judging distances.. but it was pretty freaking high! like up in high atmosphere high.) then it moved left, swinging around towards & then under the moon, & it grew larger\\closer as it did this. by then we were both (may have been 1 or 2 others out there then too?) openly wondering what it was: a helicopter? no. there's absolutely no noise. an airplane? no. no flashing lights. what is that? - all in all we watched it for a pretty long time. 5+ minutes @ least. 3.)a star (or planet - cuz so bright, & reddish) 4.)after getting a good long (& relatively close) look at it, im confident in describing it as such.... a reddish\\orange\\amber 'orb'.. it sorta glided through the sky, kinda fast too (faster than floating balloon speed, thats for sure - oh, & there was no wind at all that night anyway). when i intially noticed it, it was really bright.. then as we watched, it got dimmer (but never completely went out), then lit up again (repeated this 2.5 times). it was almost like it was a ball w\\ fire in it. no other lights. absolutely no noise omitted at all. it was a tiny bit darkers in areas, it seemed.. like the bottom, i wanna say.. but basically, it was colored\\shadded in a way that u could tell it was a sphere, a ball. - ya know? 5.) as we watched we were both just sort of mystified. im all rational thinking, so even though i pointed it out & noticed it was odd, i was kinda trying to justify it. \"its a helicopter. right?\" no, my friend said, theres no noise, heli's are loud. \"well its gotta be something. weather balloon? is that what weather balloons look like?\" i dunno said my friend.. (as it was dimming\\relighting) \"but its dimming, oh, here it comes back.. i dunno what that is, but its ******* wierd!\" just then he ran inside bar to get someone else. i just kept staring at it, trying to figure out what i was seeing. at one point i thought, & may have even said, someone should record this. i even had my blackberry in my hand.. but i didnt even try.(?!?!) - i think i figured it'd be futile, cuz my blkberry takes shitty pics\\video under good conditions.. let alone at night of something sorta smallish. now, i regret not trying. stupid. afterwards, like 30min later, as i drove home i saw a helicopter & then an airplane.. it was then that the oddness of it really set in. after seeing those the difference was strikingly evident.. no blinking lights, just one solid orb! no sound! wtf?! also, it occured to me that the whole time while we were watching it, there was not one other aircraft in the sky anywhere.. which is odd, because like i said, pretty heavy traffic area. - almost no time between 6am-1am that you cant go out, look up, & see a plane or 2.. almost dont even notice them anymore. its when there's none out, that its more noticable, you could say. 6.)it moved behind the roof of bar in the horizon, & i ran to the side & front to see if i could spot it again.. i did, from the front of bar, just as it moved far off enough so that i could not see it past the rooftops across the street. it seemed to be headed north.. and was a lot lower at this point too. ok is all. oh, quick side note.. i told this to a coworker a few days later (& he's a huge skeptic type.. not at all magical mystical conspiracy thinking sorta guy).. and he said he saw it also, w\\in 1-2 days of my sighting (timeline wasnt 100%). he had also seen it while smoking out back w\\ a customer.. only his experience was in daytime (between 7am-10am i guess, thats when he works). another difference was when he saw it it was glowing white then turned orange\\red, it too did the dimming\\relighting thing, but then he said after following it for a few minutes across the horizon, it just blinked out. (?!?!) i believe him completely, because he told me this before i had chance to explain any details about what i saw. all i had said is i seen something strange @ work. and it was 'technically' a ufo, to me @ least. then i google searched it. i found dozens & dozens of videos, pictures, & blogs & such that show or describe almost the exact same thing! (there are some that are similair but w\\ differences too.) i couldnt find any more for the same time & location as mine though. - and i dont think it was a weather balloon or lantern thing.. although, if i could find out a way to know if a wb was flying round there at that time, id check it out 4 sure too. and that is my story. never seen anything ufo-ish before in my life. not even particularly stoked that i did. just really curious."],"Date of the Event":"12/23/2010 09:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were no other sightings in San Jose on or around December 23rd 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
