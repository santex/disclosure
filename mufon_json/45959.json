I snapped 7photos that originaly i thought the camera was unable to capture the ufos. Only later that day did i realize that there wete images to look at.. when these objects left they did not fly away but simply vanished from the air...like a lightswitch had turned them off...it should be noted that one of the two craft headed off in the north east direction towards thurston it was this craft that dematerialized first then the one going north dematerialized about four minutes after tje first one... of course i was stunned and could hardly believe what had just happened.. Also there have been multiple sightings of strange craft in the sky in eugene this month..."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45959.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45959_submitter_file1__20130224012219.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45959_submitter_file2__20130224012313.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45959_submitter_file3__20130224012246.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45959_submitter_file4__20130224012232.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45959_submitter_file5__20130224012305.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45959.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Eugene","There were no other sightings in Eugene on or around February 23rd 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-123.135486"}
