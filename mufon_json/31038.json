It was raining and lightening. I was amazed at how much lightening there was. I was looking straight up into the sky from my window and I saw a pinkish orange ball of light fall from the sky. If it was lightening, I have never seen anything like it. The ball of light fell rapidly, but not in a flash. It did not behave at all like lightening as I know it behaves. It looked like something was just simply dropped straight down from the sky. It also looked like there was a mist around it, which could have been the rain giving it a gauzy effect. I felt like I was simply watching a ball of energy. It was beautiful. I lost sight of it as it went down behind some trees in my line of sight. This could be just lightening, but thought it was different and strange enough to report."]}
