So I decided to just take a video of the sun because I have seen alot of videos that supposedly have Nibru in them. I never noticed what was on this video until I watched it on my digital camera. The UFO or object starts to appear on this video as soon as I start recording. It starts to appear on the left bottom of the screen on the video. I don't know where it came from or what it is doing but it looks like it is just circling around and around the sun. You will have to look at this frame by frame because it is so fast."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"UFO/ Object flying around and near the Sun","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Strawberry Plains","There were 3 other sightings in Strawberry Plains on or around April 20th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:27","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Tennessee","Object Shape":"Disc, Unknown","Case Number":"37610","Date of the Event":"04/20/2012 01:19 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.075562,+-83.674515(37610)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37610) map </A>","City":"Strawberry Plains","Longitude":"-83.674515","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37610.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37610.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-04202012-0009","Country":"United States"}
