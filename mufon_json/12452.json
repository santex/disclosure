Much like every other weekend our nearby aunts and uncles would gather for dinner at my Grandmothers house and us grandkids would hang out outside. Most of the time we would look up into the vast night sky which many stars were visible out there.(being out of any city light)On this night My cousin;17, my brother;13 and myself;15 years old (at that time), were looking out into the southern sky and above us. Below this sky is an endless range of large hills rolling through our area all the way to the coast. From hill tops to right above us we scanned the sky and nothing but the stars were out. All of a sudden after about 20 minutes of gazing, I had been looking just above and ahead in more of a southeast direction. Some kind of light radiated from a central point in that spot in the sky. I Immediately shouted to my brother and cousin. ���LOOK!'. It had already passed by the time they looked out to what I was pointing at. But not 3 seconds had passed when we all together sough it again but it seemed brighter this time and in 2 or three simultaneous ripples. I say ripples because that is how I saw it. They were two or three split second pulses of bluish -white light radiating and growing like ripples in a pond when throwing a pebble. This whole event took no longer than 3 to 5 seconds. The light that rippled seemed to almost follow the contour of our outer atmosphere's dome. Though that was interesting and creepy at the same time; not 2 seconds later did we see a single pinpoint of red light in that same general area. This light was like a star but a constant red. In our excitement we kept our eyes glued to this point of light. The light then started to move and get slightly bigger and brighter. The light now was definitely moving, not blinking, but appeared to move at great speed and in sharp angle downward and toward the west. With in seconds the object ended up about a mile away it seemed. All three of us owing and aching and briefly discussing how fast it must have traveling compared to a jet. The red light hovered above a tree line on a hill just south of us. Straight ahead of us. My brother pointed out light from the object hitting the tree tops. The red light was faint and it did appear that close to the trees. It seemed like we were watching it for quite a while, just sitting there hovering . There was no apparent movement; no flashing or blinking of the light. The object had a constant deep red light like a red LED. We were sure as we spoke to each other right than and there that it was not moving. The light had not changed in size or direction. All of a sudden after about 10 minutes it rows and took a sharp south eastern direction and then just disappeared. I have seen two more similar sightings in later years as has my girlfriend. Never again have I seen the \"ripple in the sky\" though. My brother and cousin and I all still talk about it and refresh the story. It has stayed clear in our minds over the years and true to all three of us. If any others have similar stories, tell it. The world needs to know. Thank you."],"Date of the Event":"06/30/1995 09:00 UTC"}
