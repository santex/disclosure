I was watching TV and during the commercials I ran out to check for meteors since tonight is lyrid. 2. Was looking for meteors. 3. I thought it was a plane. I ran in to get a family member to check it out and confirm. 4. Object moved erratically but consistently east to west with lots of colorful blinking light. What caught our attention was it moved way way too fast for the angles it was making. this was no plane. this is the first time i have seen something nutty like this 5. It did NOT fly in a straight line it went east to west but not in a straight line not consistent and NOT an airplane. 6. It headed south toward Mexico and I lost a visual. it is in the first quarter part of the pic bit just a dot. WE ARE NOT Crazy. this is awesome"]}
