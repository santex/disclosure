I had a panic attack on October 20th, 2010 that I do not remember. According to witnesses including my best friend and husband I was refusing assistance, cowaring in a corner trying to protect myself for 30 minutes following a movie, the Fourth Kind. I was fine through out the whole movie, but the end got me. I admit I may be crazy, but since I was a child I have had strange visions of events before they happen. Vivid dreams that I have months to weeks before they come true. I am currently a straight A student at an excellent university and am cautious about my disclosures. I know too well of secrets to be kept secret. However, the dreams have become more vivid as of late and I am greatly concerned.
