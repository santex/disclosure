I then noticed that it started to decend rapidly. I thought itmight be an airplane about to crash. Then it came close enough that I could makeout a shape. It was as tall as an airplane would be stood on its side (wing towing). It was rectangular in shape. It looked like it was going to crash intothe ground near the highway, so I stopped my car thinking I was about to see anexplosion. Then as it approached the ground I saw a red light at the bottom andthe light fizzled as the object disappeared. It was as if it entered the placewhere the red light was and did not come out of the bottom. The thing that Icould liken it to would be a huge rectangular meteor that burned up just beforeit hit the ground."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"1391","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date of the Event":"11/12/2001 08:30 UTC","Longitude":"-90.388137","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"11/12/2001 08:30 UTC","City":"Boutte","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.902428,+-90.388137(1391)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1391) map </A>","Log Number":"","Latitude":"29.902428","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Boutte","There were no other sightings in Boutte on or around November 12th 2001"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
