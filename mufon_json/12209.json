I awoke but experienced a choking sensation and extreme naseau followed by dizziness and heavy perspiring and disorientation. This has never happened to me before and I was wondering if these symptoms had occurred to others after 'dreaming' of aliens and crafts. The object that stands out most in my mind was one craft shaped like a black triangle with a shiny silver diamond shape on one surface."],"Tags":"City"}
