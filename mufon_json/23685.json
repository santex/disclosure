{"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/09/2010 10:53 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","City":"La Porte","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside for a smoke and looking directly up above me since the constelation of drago is supposed to be directly above my head according to star maps of June, I seen this dimly lit object which might be a communication satellite or some such man made object traveling from the south to the north parallel and on the right side of the handle of the little dipper? I am guessing it is the little dipper because the pan of the dipper faces the north star. After the object past the handle of the little dipper it quickly faded from eyesight. I have never seen a satellite in this flight path before but I have to consider the possibility of it being a man made satellite and I don't know what path they take across the sky. No pictures or film was taken."],"Log Number":"US-06102010-0002","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23685.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23685.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/10/2010 12:43 UTC","Latitude":"41.615947","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-86.71131","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"23685","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.615947,+-86.71131(23685)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23685) map </A>","trends":["There have been 32 other sightings in La Porte","There were no other sightings in La Porte on or around June 9th 2010"],"Summary":"very dim object possible communication satellite","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
