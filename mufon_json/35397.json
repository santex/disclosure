Got closer and took a picture.","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving down the Draper Road and noticed the lights higher in the sky. They looked still and I thought they were from a tower because it looked still. It caught my attention because we have no tower where I saw the lights. As I got closer to the lights they went in front of the car at about tree level and I could tell they were moving. I stopped the car at Draper and Harvey Road and rolled down the window to take a picture. I listened for a sound and was amazed that there was no sound coming from them. I followed them up into the driveway on Harvey Road. It went over the ridge behind our house and disappeared. The sighting left me in awe."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Clear Spring","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Maryland","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Latitude":"39.668946","Longitude":"-77.940654"}
