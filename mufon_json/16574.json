It was a very clear night no clouds at all. Then I woke up this morning at 9:00 AM I walked out on my patio and to my surprise I noticed that there were so many chemtrails! Then I noticed the moon had a bright object next to it that was very large to the naked eye and it was not moving. I ran and got my camera and zoomed in to find what looks like a cigar shaped space ship of some kind! When I zoomed in it shape shifted and then It starts moving off to the distance to the west of LAX and then disappears in a poof. But I did see it flying very far off into the distance at the end clip I recorded. Then it came back into site again and I recorded it for about 10 min and it was changing its shape very slowly. It still may be there now."],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Boomerang, Cigar, Cylinder, Disc","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16574.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16574.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.962532,+-118.433385(16574)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16574) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"33.962532","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around April 19th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"16574"}
