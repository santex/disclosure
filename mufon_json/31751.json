And then it appeared randomly out of the corner of my eye. It looked like a star, or a plane but it wasn't moving. While i was watching it my heart started to hurt, and my chest felt as if i couldn't breathe i was staring at it for a really long time, after i felt fine. And i lost sight of the object after i glanced away to look at my cat, when i looked back..... It was gone. I Ran inside and stayed there for the night."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09112011-0021","Latitude":"42.869672","Longitude":"-106.303551","Object Shape":"Circle, Egg, Fireball, Flash, Oval, Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31751.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31751.html"],"Region":"Wyoming","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Casper","There were no other sightings in Casper on or around September 10th 2011"],"City":"Casper","Date Submitted":"09/11/2011 06:52 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/10/2011 10:43 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Too long to summarize.","Case Number":"31751","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
