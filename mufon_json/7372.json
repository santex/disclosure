I though it was an airplane. It stopped by a clump of trees leaning to the left. The third ball of light shot up into the sky. It came back down level towards the ground. The colors were of sunset colors. And there was no water nearby. The middle light blinked, then the left one blinked. The last one blinked. It went straight up by the tree lines.

And I havent seen anything since."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.819015,+-86.01704(7372)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7372) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7372.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7372.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There were no other sightings in Indianapolis on or around November 30th 2000"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"lights across field","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"7372","Region":"Indiana","Log Number":"US-07052007-0007","Longitude":"-86.01704","Source":"MUFON","City":"Indianapolis","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown"}
