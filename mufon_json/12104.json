{"Latitude":"33.842553","divs":["sighting detailsi was leaving the it's a grind coffee house, located at tustin ave. and la palma ave in the anaheim hills area, at close to 6:00pm. as i got to the parking lot exit, i was facing north. that is when my attention was brought to what appeared at first to be a meteor, exploded plane, missile, or some such thing falling from the sky, about 45 degrees to my left, being northeast of my position. initially, it was quite alarming to me because of the all the possibilities of what it might be, none of them good. a cold winter storm had just passed through, and low, dark, broken clouds from the tail end of the storm were present. clouds were low and broken, but air was very clear. as i watched, it deduced from the path, speed, and size that the object would almost certainly hit the ground, in a heavily poulated urban area. i first saw the object come down at a steep angle well above the clouds, and expected to see it punch through the clouds and hit the ground. my mind went through the short list of things it could be. i hoped it was not a ballistic missile, as it might be the last thing i would ever see. i hoped it was not a plane that had exploded, or a large meteorite. the object entered the top of some cold, thick, dark scud clouds, but instead of punching through and continuing on to hit the ground, it instantaneously stopped cold, just at or below the bottoms of the clouds. at that point i knew i was definitely not seeing a meteor, plane, or missile. nothing moving that fast, falling from the sky stops on a dime and just hovers like that. as i watched, the object began to appear larger, perhaps hundreds of feet across, and glow brilliantly with a most pure light. it appeared huge, because it was miles away, appearing in the northeast, approximately over the hills north of fullerton, or over brea. almost instantly, what i thought was one object, appeared to become two. it seems like the second one very quickly joined the first, but i do not recall seeing but one object falling, trailing what appeared to be flames, or glowing plasma. as i watched in amazement, an airplane and a helicopter quickly converged on the objects. the speed at which they did this was uncanny, almost like they knew it was coming. but maybe they just happened to be right there, as the skies in this area are always quite busy. the airplane then arrived on the scene and circled the two objects very closely, while the hleicopter stood off a bit further away, bobbing and weaving about, also investigating. i would think that both the plane and the helicopter pilots must have gotten very good, up-close looks at these objects, and probably photos and\\or video. i was amazed by how tight the circles were that the airplane was able to execute, and how much larger the objects appeared to be than the plane. i estimate that the objects were at least 5 times bigger, or more, than the wingspan of the plane. the whole bizarre affair, the two brilliant, large, hovering objects, the circling plane, and the inquisitive helicopter all started moving slowly to the northeast, against prevailing winds, and moved below my sightline until they were obscured by buildings and trees in my location. i decided then to give chase, zig zag my way across town, and try to keep the objects in view for as long as possible. i got onto tustin ave, headed north, went left on la palma, west, to miller, where i went right, north, to orangethorpe, and headed west again a mile or two. i estimate my travel at 3 miles. i managed to keep them in view most of the time, but had to stop at a traffic light on orangethorpe. stopped at the light with my head and shoulders sticking out of the window of my car, looking over the roof, i watched the objects simply blink out, like someone turning off a light switch. the impression i had was that they had actually left the scene at incredible speed, making them appear to simply blink out and literally disappear. the plane that was circling them did one or two more circles, but there was nothing there anymore to see, so it, and the helicopter both broke off their investigations. the plane headed southeast, and by chance, flew directly over me at a fairly low altitude. it appeared to be a medium sized twin engine jet. it was low enough for it's underside to be dimly illuminated by the glow from the city lights. it may have been military, but i cannot say with any certainty. i said nothing to anyone for 3-4 day, until i saw a large number of reports of the same exact incident being posted online, on brian vike's website. i then posted my initial report there. i was amazed at how consistent al lthe reports were, and how they all described exactly what i witnessed. brian vike contacted me and we have spoken on two occassions since. i have not spoken and have never met any of the other witnesses. i would thinlk that it would be of paramount importance to get the radar data and flight plans of any aircraft in the area to determine exactly who was flying the plane and the helicopter that were involved in this sighting, and to verify the plane circling the objects, if not the objects themselves. it would be great to identify and interview the pilots, and see if they have any photos or video. i am not aware of any pilots filing any reports, so whoever they are, to my knowledge, they have yet to come forward and tell what they saw, up close and personal. a foia for the radar data and all flight plans putting aircraft in that area at that time are in order. the plane and helicopter should have had transponders, because of the heavy air traffic in the area and proximity to fullerton and the main approach to john wayne airports."],"Case
