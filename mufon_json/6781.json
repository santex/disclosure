They don't male any noise. Looked up at the sky and noticed them. The way they kept moving. Very hard to get pi ctures. It is best if you see it. All you see is lights and it being there every night at the same time seems unusual. The idea of not knowing what it is is unsettling. My son sees it and my my neighbor saw it and we cannot figure it out. When the day light starts it leaves in fact saw one going through the clouds at 6 a.m."],"Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-72.585601","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
