{"Region":"Northern Cape","divs":["sighting detailsat 9 pm on june 24, 2009, i was sitting with a friend on the verandah of a chalet on the banks of the orange river in south africa's remote richtersveld national park. looking up at the sky, my attention was drawn to a bright yellow object moving from left to right across the night sky. i directed my friend's attention to the object and he saw it too, moving rapidly on a course parallell to the earth. i had it in vision for about 10 seconds before it changed direction and vanished into the sky. i was truly amazed to see this phenomenon, as it was the second sighting we had made at the same place within two years. the nature of this sighting was very similar to the first, which we made on an assignment in the richtersveld national park on november 21, 2007 at 10 pm and which i subsequently reported to ufoinfo.com. the sighting made on june 24 2009 left us in absolutely no doubt that what we witnessed on both occasions was a ufo. the area is hundreds of kilometers from the nearest airport and remote from any towns or air traffic. for your interest, i attach the report of the first sighting we made on november 21,2007. location of sighting: richtersveld south africa. november 21,2007 number of witnesses: 2 number of objects: 1 shape of objects: oval. full description of event\\sighting: an author, tim o'hagan and a journalist, geoff dalglish, doing a road trip through southern africa, were staying alone at a remote bush lodge on the banks of the orange river in the richtersveld when they saw an elliptical shaped object emanating a yellow\\gold light move across the sky directly within their vision at an angle of about 70 degrees. the object had a trajectory that seemed parallel to the earth and this trajectory continued for about seven seconds. the object then turned south and seemed to maintain its parallel course before disappearing entirely in a nanosecond. both parties have no explanation for this sighting which was several hundred kilometers from any airport. i hope this information is useful to you, kind regards timo'hagan"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/24/2009 09:04 UTC","City":"Springbok","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-29.666667,+17.883333(17807)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17807) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"17.883333","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Second UFO sighting at same place in two years.","Latitude":"-29.666667","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"ZA-07052009-0012","Case Number":"17807","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17807.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17807.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Springbok","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"06/24/2009 09:04 UTC","Country":"South Africa","Weather Factors":"Windy"}
