{"Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"LOOKED UP AT A MILITARY JET TO SEE A SILENT WHITE UFO TRAILING JET BY 3 SECONDS.","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was enjoying time in the Sonoran desert with my girlfriend. We spent a lot of time in the desert during that period while living in Tucson. We never drank or did any kind of drugs during that period either and were completely sober during this incident. I heard a jet flying over at a relatively low altitude of I'm guessing about 500 feet, and instinctly looked up toward it. It was a military fighter jet, which didn't seem to abnornmal since there was an Air Force base in Tucson. I watched the jet for a second or two, then following about 3 seconds behind the jet was a silver-white disc with no detail that I could see. It was making no noise but appeared to be traveling the same speed as the jet. It also appeared to be approximately the same size as the jet. This all happened so fast that I quickly grabbed my camera phone and tried to take a picture of it but it was in the clouds by the time I took the picture. This was one of the most exciting life experiences."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.227583,+-110.923159(7850)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7850) map </A>","Latitude":"32.227583","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"03/10/2006 02:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09052007-0008","City":"Tucson","Longitude":"-110.923159","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/10/2006 02:00 UTC","Region":"Arizona","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There were no other sightings in Tucson on or around March 10th 2006"],"Case Number":"7850","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7850.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7850.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
