I glanced to the east and saw the 4 color flashing lights. I noticed the object because of the colors and it did not stop flashing. I knew then it was not a star. I thought the object oddly colored and grabbed a pair of binoculars to look at the lights it was flashing. It just kept on flashing the 4 colors and did not appear to have motion. I am not afraid of the object. Then, I noticed the 3 smaller ones doing the same flashing but spaced far apart from the bigger and brighter one. Now, I am even more curious as 20 minutes pass and a sparkling flare is emitted from one of the objects and evaporates on ground contact. I did not lose sight of these 4 objects, they stayed in one place all night. They were even there on Monday night in the same place. I suppose they are they when it starts to get dark. I will need to look into that."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11232010-0010","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"26720","City":"Paxton","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Paxton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26720.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26720.html"],"Longitude":"-86.308108","Date Submitted":"11/23/2010 04:34 UTC"}
