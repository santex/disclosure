{"Case Number":"15638","divs":["sighting detailsi was leaving the palms-rancho park library at about 5:15 p.m., getting on my bike when i noticed,what i thought was a slow moving \"jet\". it was headed east which is the normal flightpath for a lot of the lax air traffic. i then noticed a comercial airline traveling east bound that was higher than the object i was observing. also, there was a private airplane traveling east and banking left (a wide u turn) to head for the santa monica airport west, wich was much lower than the craft. it was moving so slowly that it couldn't have been a normal aircraft. so i then thought it must be a blimp or baloon. that's when i really noticed the shape of a triangle. it was like a burnt-orange or ox-blood color and had some type of markings at the tip of each corner. the sun had not set yet, so i could not tell if the markings were lights or what. i've lived in the area for over 18 yrs. so i'm familure w\\ the \"normal airtraffic and flight patterns of the lax and santa monica airports. i urgently started looking around for someone that i knew to show them, but there were only random strangers about. so i began asking different adults and teenagers to look at the object too. not wanting to plant suggestions of any kind, i was saying things like \"excuse me, i don't see that well, could you tell me what that is up there?\", pointing to the object, which had now stopped and was hovering almost straight above. everyone i asked pretty much had the same initial thoughts that i had had...\"that's a jet...oh..no...i think thats a balloon...no... it's...uh...hell i don't know what that is...hey! you guys! look! what is that?! i then thought, \"maybe i can make it home so that i can show my roommate, since he's always wanted to see a \"ufo\". home is only two blocks away, so i went for it, made it to the front door, looked up it was still there! i went in the house and began telling him, \"man, there's a ufo hovering straight up, right now! he headed for the front and i was headed for the back door and told him,\"come-on, we can see it right here from the back! well,...you know what happened when we went outside, nothing. it was nowhere to be found. i kept looking for about five more min. but nothing. i'm reporting this in the hopes that someone else may seen this too."],"Date of the Event":"02/20/2009 05:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"33.9956","Object Shape":"Blimp, Triangle","Date Submitted":"02/20/2009 05:15 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15638.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15638.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Culver City","There were no other sightings in Culver City on or around February 20th 2009"],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Longitude":"-118.433104","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.9956,+-118.433104(15638)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15638) map </A>","City":"Culver City","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-02212009-0010","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"\"pie-wedged\" shaped object moving very slowly; turned sharp left, then hovered for approx. 10 min."}
