Fireball-like intermittently.","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were walking on the dark beach, and witnessed flashing objects over the Atlantic that looked like fireflies at first, but high altitude and high speed. Intermittent flashing unlike aircraft lights. Flew in square formation then random. Flying in a fairly straight trajectory NE. Appeared as fireball-like for a few seconds then disappeared and reappeared shortly after as the flashing lights again. Repeated these actions again. It wasn't like anything we had ever seen before. Did not appear to be any aircraft that we were familiar with. Cloud cover from coming storm blocked our viewing after an hour or so."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-78.678606","Date Submitted":"06/17/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17533.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17533.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Light"}
