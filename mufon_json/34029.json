{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was Wednesday night and I was laying in bed at 10 oclock when I noticed at the corner of my eye a bright green light in the sky out of my bedroom window. A couple weeks prior I saw a similar light and thought that maybe it was a green shooting star. When I saw the same type of green light in the sky again it immediatly gave me chills and I yelled out to my wife that the green light was back. It shot across the sky and went toward the ground. It lasted about 3 seconds."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.683183","City":"Lake Forest","Date of the Event":"12/14/2011 10:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/15/2011 01:31 UTC","Summary":"Green light ball shot across the sky toward ground","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Lake Forest","There were no other sightings in Lake Forest on or around December 14th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Log Number":"US-12152011-0002","Case Number":"34029","Longitude":"-117.666431","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34029.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34029.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.683183,+-117.666431(34029)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34029) map </A>","Region":"California","Tags":"City"}
