They stayed in view, ascending slightly until they finally just faded out. The event was observed from my automobile as I was driving to work, between Kellyton, AL, and Goodwater, AL on US Highway 280, about 10 miles west of Alexander City, AL. I was able to keep the objects in view for four minutes. The day was clear, with scattered high cloud. I was driving in a northwesterly direction, and the objects appeared at my 2:00 position moving north to south. They were are very bright white, and were cylinder shaped. There were no wings or other control surfaces I could see. They did not have the silhouette of rotary winged aircraft, appearing to be long and slender, rod like in their appearance. They were making a broad westerly turn, and ascending very slightly. Their position to each other remained constant, one was slightly above and behind the other, as shown below: _________________________ _________________________ I observed them almost continually for four minutes; I was driving and did have to be aware of road conditions. They finally just faded out, for lack of a better term at about my 10:00 position. I grew up near and live Fort Benning, GA, and am familiar with most contemporary aircraft and helicopters. That���s not what these were. I also moved my head around as much as I could, to make sure they weren���t reflections in my car���s windshield. They weren���t. They appeared to be close, I would say two miles or under, and were under 5000 feet altitude. I have good vision, and as a result of my job I am a trained observer. What struck me was the fairly slow speed, and brilliant whiteness of these objects, and the fact they faded away."],"Object Shape":"Cylinder","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46515.html"],"Region":"Alabama","Tags":"City","Summary":"Two cylindrical objects in formation moving N to S","Date Submitted":"03/31/2013 10:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Alexander City","Case Number":"46515","Longitude":"-85.947023","Log Number":"US-03312013-0020","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Date of the Event":"03/28/2013 10:35 UTC"}
