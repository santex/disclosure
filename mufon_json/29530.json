Number one appeared as a bright flash to my SW. It was like a meteorite lasting only a few seconds from south to north. Number two started a south to north track east of number one. It came directly overheaed. As I turned to keep watching it, I lost it or it disapeared. Number three started a south to north long track east of number two almost overhead. It continues north as number four apears west of three. Number four starts a long track north to south, then turns on a long arc to the east. Each of these eventually disapear. 3 and 4 are the longest viewed ones, about a min or two apiece. I thought they were aircraft, but they had no nav lights or strobes, only a single white light. I then thought maybe satalites, but so many in one part of the sky is unusual. All four looked like high altitude objects. No other aircraft were seen in the area."],"Latitude":"41.619005","Region":"Illinois","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.619005,+-88.198019(29530)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29530) map </A>","Summary":"Four star like objects moving in seperate directions.","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06132011-0012"}
