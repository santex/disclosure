It was a set of three lights that moved very fast back and fourth in one area. I pointed it out to the other people there ( about 7 of us )and for almost 2 minutes it ( for a lack of better words ) danced in the sky. Then just disappeared. We were all stunned and in disbelief at what we saw and spent the next hour or so trying to come to some conclusion as to what it was. I live in the country were sky viewing is very good and me and my boys love to look at the stars. We see satellites almost nightly and planes both high and low altitude constantly.
