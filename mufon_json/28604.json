{"divs":["Sighting DetailsA few of my friends and me were sitting by the fire, at the moment I was looking towards the sky. I saw a blue light(bright blue)moving toward the ground at approximately a 4:00 position as on clock hands. At the same time, Mark yelled \"what the hell is that\". We had time to stand and walk about 10 ft before it went out of view right where it looked like it should have hit the ground. It looked like a bright ball that was solid blue with a green hue. It wasnt moving fast enough for anything that may have been burning up in the atmosphere from entry plus there wasnt a tail. I had time to ponder what it could be before it went out of sight. It never dimmed or flashed. It looked like a missile was about to hit. I kept my eyes on the area for at least five minutes then we decided to drive over to the area we saw it. Took cameras and binaculars with us but couldnt find it. Whatever we saw, in my opinion, was not a meteorite or a firework. Im looking online now to see if anyone else reported it."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Defiance","There were no other sightings in Defiance on or around April 9th 2011"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04102011-0003","City":"Defiance","Region":"Ohio","Longitude":"-84.34916","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28604.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28604.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"04/10/2011 02:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Oval","Latitude":"41.292693","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Summary":"out of nowhere a bright ball of blue light showed up moving at an angle towards the ground.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/09/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"28604","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.292693,+-84.34916(28604)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28604) map </A>"}
