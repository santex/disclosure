The small craft appeared as a varying point of light and moved across what had to be thousands of miles of space instantly, as though protecting a spot in space. It appeared to be firing some sort of guided type of light weapon at the larger object. This went on for many minutes and I recorded it on my cellphone camera for over 7 minutes until the battery died. I as of yet have not tried to have the video enhanced on a computer but plan on doing so in the near future."],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45625.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45625.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.694246,+-86.2694(45625)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45625) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Indiana"}
