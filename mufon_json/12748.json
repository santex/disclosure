I was on the phone with my mother-in-law when at first I noticed a low flying Army Transport Plane. It was about 4-6 stories high about to fly over the school. I looked out over the school back field when I noticed a cylindrical bright light in the sky around our local Wal-Mart (Oxford Valley Rd.) or down over the Walgreens pharmacy, off New Falls Rd. Before the transport plane could cross in front of my view of this thing, it faded out. This light was to the right of the transport plane. It was a very interesting sight. On my way home from picking my son up we noticed a military helicopter flying over our area. I don't make much of this as we see many helicopters flying around throughout the day."],"City":"Fairless Hills","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"12748","Summary":"Cylindrical star-like light seen in Fairless Hills in daylight.","Longitude":"-74.846544","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Latitude":"40.187294","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12748.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12748.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/23/2008 03:26 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/23/2008 03:26 UTC"}
