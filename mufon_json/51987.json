Bright blue sky with puffy white clouds about 2,000 elevation. I have never seen an airliner fly over in the north. Saw this silver object fly out of one white cloud into another.

I saw one of these 180 turn arounds with the same type of aircraft in 1952 with my Dad. He also saw it and said it was a tricky fighter jet developed to fight in the Korean War. I witnessed the 1966 UFO sighting over downtown L.A. that was featued in the LAX Tower scene in \"Close Encounters\". Several incomming airline pilots, the Tower and a bunch of us at USC saw it around 5pm. Sailed over 3 100' diameter blue green discs on a foggy May night at midnight on the way to Catalina Island. They were several feet below the surface and lit our boat like a phosphorus shake stick. 5 us were on the boat as witness."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.159493,+-109.972238(51987)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51987) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Pinetop-Lakeside","Date Submitted":"11/02/2013 06:59 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11022013-0013","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-109.972238","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
