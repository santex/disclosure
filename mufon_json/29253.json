City","Tags":"City","Latitude":"14.579444","divs":["sighting detailsi am 17 years old\\ first year college student going second year. i live in the philippines. i'm completely sane and in the right state of mind. i don't do drugs nor drink alcoholic beverages. i don't have any mental illnesses. i wasn't hungry nor was i thinking of any personal problems at that time. in short, i was very very sure and certain of what i saw and i was not imagining things nor am i making things up (why would a teenager like me spend time here if i was making things up). anyway, here's what happened (may 25, 2011, summer time\\vacation time in the philippines). we were on our way home. starting approximately 8:30pm, i was with my mom just sitting in an immobile car(in a parking space of san miguel corporation in mandaluyong city, philippines) with the doors all open(the car's engine hasn't been started) because we were waiting for my sister. i was sitting in the left side of the backseat beside the open door with earphones only on my right ear, listening to the radio while my mom was in the front passenger seat trying to get some sleep. south of our position was a building being constructed (at that time workers are still busy working at the top floor and i could tell from the lights and sounds of hammering, drilling, etc.). it was almost finished so it was very high. that building is a condo called \"sonata\" with address san miguel ave cor lourdes st mandaluyong city, philippines. then at approximately 8:45 pm, a worker yelled and i don't know what that worker was yelling about so i looked up at the direction of \"sonata\" (at the top floor where the workers at) and at that moment i saw what i first thought was smoke or some gray cloud high in the sky moving at my west direction of our car. it was located between the position of our car and and the building of sonata and was moving towards the direction of sm megamall. but then as i stared at it and concentrated, i was beginning to think and see that it wasn't a puffy gray smoke or cloud. it actually has a distinct solid shape-- v shaped and i began to notice some very faint yellowish lights (that just looked like far away stars covered by a thick cloud since it's faint) underneath its cockpit\\head (vertex of the letter v). it was as slower than the speed of a passenger airplane in flight. it is flying very high (i could tell because at my view it, flies higher than the tall buildings around it---namely sonata and san miguel properties which happen to be beside each other) but it was as huge as my view of an international airplane flying 10 feet above me. what's weird is that at it's size, i don't hear any sound from it -- no sound of wind nor engines. then with all that information, my mind processed that it's nothing normal so i my heart started to beat fast and i feel adrenaline rushing through my body (same as feeling of anxiety), my eyes opened wide but i was in a state of great shock (my body was temporarily paralyzed and stuck in my position as i stared at the moving object)-- i was just sitting there and i wasn't even focusing\\listening to the radio on my right ear anymore. then, approximately 5-10 minutes later still in that state of shock\\not moving, i began to move and wake my mom up and pointed at it's direction. as my mom was bending backwards to my door (while she is still sitting at the right passenger seat of the car), my mind gave me the thought to get a photo or video through my phone. i was trembling as i handled my phone and pressed buttons just to get to its camera function (because my mind was panicking, i was even able to click the wrong applications and resulted in delay time). but at that very moment, the object was already approximately above st. francis road and then it smoothly turned left towards the direction of st. francis of assissi church -- so it began to be covered by the building of san miguel properties. it was now covered by the building before my mom could even see it and before i could even get to the camera function of my phone. i wasn't able to think of running towards it (at that time) because i can't believe what i just saw. i then started to tell my mom what it was and i pondered about what that could be. i was forcing myself to think that it was just some man-made, possibly military air craft but i couldn't think of any man-made craft that fit my description (especially my description about its silence in moving and it's unbelievable size). then, 3-5 minutes after i lost it, my sister arrived and we went on home. as we arrived home i told my family about it then i quickly rushed to my laptop and searched in google.com and found i was shocked to find these, when i was hoping to find man-made air crafts: http:\\\\www.ufocasebook.com\\2009\\californiatrisightingnov2008.html http:\\\\www.examiner.com\\ufo-in-national\\v-shaped-ufo-under-1-000-feet-smoothly-gliding-over-grandview-missouri those fit my description but i didn't see any red lights on it's v-structure. also, i was certain that it was v-shaped not triangular. here's a map of the area:http:\\\\maps.google.com\\maps?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&channel=s&hl=tl&biw=1280&bih=674&um=1&ie=utf-8&q=san+miguel+properties&fb=1&gl=ph&hq=san+miguel+properties&hnear=0x3397ca03571ec38b:0x69d1d5751069c11f,maynila&cid=0,0,12978885034006348336&ei=dcjdtyl3misgvaoo_oxibq&sa=x&oi=local_result&ct=image&resnum=4&ved=0cdyqnwiwaw by the way, the \"a\" or target in the map is the building of san miguel properties which i was mentioning above. at it's right is the sonata building that is still being constructed. then approximately 45 degrees to the right and 50 feet from the building of san miguel was our car. our car was facing north towards st. francis square. i am just getting finished in writing this now may 26,2011, 12:06 pm philippine time (just a day after i saw it). right now i am still in shock and i think i'll never forget about that until i know what it was (because i am a very curious individual). i hope someone investigates on this and i hope the workers on the top floor of sonata witnessed it too. if ever it gets publicized, i am willing to step in as a witness even though i'm this young."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Mandaluyong City","There were no other sightings in Mandaluyong City on or around May 25th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One
