I was in Bluffton IN for a death in the family and I stepped out back to smoke about 2:45 AM. 2.I looked up towards the south to look at the stars and something moving caught my attention 3.At first I thought it was just a jet then I noticed there were 5 lights about the same brightness as the stars.I then thought it was a flock of geese and the city lights were reflecting off their stomachs but the lights were moving too fast to be geese. then I thought they were miltary jets but there was no sounds of jet engines. It was very early in the morning so it was very quite. 4. there were 5 lights in a V pattern moving east to south west 5. My first reaction was, what the heck is that, then I tried to figure out what it was, see #3. My reaction after was odd because I was trying to wrap my mind around the fact that it wasn't geese or jets. Disbeleif would pretty much sum up what I felt. 6. The lights just traveled till they were out of sight. I am guessing the whole thing lasted 5-10 seconds"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"18422","City":"Bluffton","Date Submitted":"07/30/2009 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07312009-0017","Latitude":"40.738658","Date of the Event":"07/30/2009 12:00 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Summary":"5 lights in a V pattern","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
