{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the morning of October 31, 2011 I had gone outside to let my dog outside to use do his business. The time would be between 5:30am and 6am. While I was outside with him I tend to look up at the stars. I love the stars so when they are visible I look at them. As I was looking I noticed what appeared to be two boomerang shapes as one object. It had small lights on it to resemble stars but the object was solid. To me it resembled a consultation. It was about the size of a somewhat low flying commercial airplane, it travelled from north to south. It didn't make a sound, it was very quite outside. I live off of I635 and I35."],"Latitude":"39.122893","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/31/2011 05:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50164.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50164.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/25/2013 08:19 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.122893,+-94.620694(50164)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50164) map </A>","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.620694","Log Number":"US-08252013-0027","Case Number":"50164","Object Features":"None","Region":"Kansas","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Summary":"Moved from north to south.
