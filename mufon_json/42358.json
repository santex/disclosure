I was looking at the stars when I noticed this object fly overhead from the north and pass directly overhead going from north to south. It made no noise and the 5 lights were solid red and were not flashing. At first I thought it was a formation of jets from nearby Tyndal Air Force Base but when I did not see any flashing lights nor any sound coming from it, I got curious. It was a v-shaped formation of 5 solid red lights moving at a moderate speed across the sky. I never encountered it again nor did I find anyone else who saw it. I then noticed after watching some UFO shows on t.v. that this object was seen in the southwest U.S."],"Log Number":"US-09072012-0006","Latitude":"29.741667","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.741667,+-84.876944(42358)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42358) map </A>","Case Number":"42358","Date of the Event":"06/30/1992 10:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Eastpoint","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Eastpoint","There were no other sightings in Eastpoint on or around June 30th 1992"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"09/07/2012 10:22 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
