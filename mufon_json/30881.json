It was a summer night with my friends katelyn and cory, we had made a fire in my backyard fire pit and were talking and looking up at the stars. Later that night i noticed to my left a small white and red light far away behind the trees. so i figured it was a airplane but as it got closer i herd no sound and the lights were not blinking like a plane they were constantly on. The light got closer and closer untill it was right over my house and thats when i knew it was not like anything iv ever seen, It was about 40 to 60 feet above the trees and moving at around 5 mph. It was a long oval shaped object around 90 to 120 feet long, it made no sound and just seemed to float along. there were 4 to 5 beems of pure white light scanning the ground and a white circle on the bottom, i felt sick and scared so i ran inside with my friends to tell my parents but when i returned it was gone. I will never forget that day"],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Window(s)","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Cigar, Oval","Summary":"ufo sighting cedar park texas 1998"}
