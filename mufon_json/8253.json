{"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Missouri","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was going out side my house to clean out a couple of coolers. I all of a sudden felt the need to look up in the sky. In the north sky I seen a boomerang shaped object glowing a soft red. It did a sort of hover spin thing and took off way too fast to have been military. I finished cleaning out the coolers wondering what i had seen. I went inside and told my dad about what I had seen. He thought I was kidding and told me to tell my friends at school that I needed to stay off the drugs. He was just kidding but I still thought he thought I was kidding. by a 12 year old"],"Date of the Event":"10/30/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"a soft glowing red boomerang shaped object","Date Submitted":"10/30/2007 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Longitude":"-91.535981","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.645599,+-91.535981(8253)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8253) map </A>","City":"Salem","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8253.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8253.html"],"Case Number":"8253","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"37.645599","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Salem","There were no other sightings in Salem on or around October 30th 2007"],"Log Number":"US-10312007-0001"}
