It was just after 1 pm when I saw a series of lights strobing or flashing. There were 7-8 of these lights, one would \"Flash,\" \"Strobe\" or \"Pulse.\" As soon as one would appear, the previous one would fade out. They were in a semi-circular pattern, and appeared to be hovering over Weston, MO. The event lasted for about 45 seconds. I know the time and exact location because I snapped a picture of some of these lights with my iPhone- It recorded the time date and GPS location when the picture was taken. My feelings were curiousity and interest in whatever they were. As soon as I snapped the picture and lowered my iPhone the lights were gone. I did submit a copy of the photo to Steve Winons and Margie Kay. I am a member of MUFON's Kansas Chapter."],"Object Features":"None, Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
