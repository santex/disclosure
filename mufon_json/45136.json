{"City":"Nashville","divs":["Sighting DetailsWith two of us in the auto coming out of Nashville headed East on I-24 - just before the Mufreesboro exit we both witnessed a dark object bobbing up and down - poking out of the top of a \"cloud\" (?). Moving side to side as well. After several minutes of this odd movement the object was gone. As we traveled toward the area where the object had been spotted - there were NO clouds. During the sighting we both noticed a white helicopter in the same vicinity. As quickly as the object disappeared......the helicopter was gone as well."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Dome","Date Submitted":"01/10/2013 10:20 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"For several minutes the dark object poked in and out of a \"cloud\" (?).
