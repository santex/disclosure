From the South West I spotted two bright lights. It appeared they were moving very quickly to the North East. The light would fade from the UFO in front and then the one following would get brighter. From where we were it seemed that the one following was 6 inches behind the other. We watched them go to the NE and all of a sudden their lights dissapeared."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
