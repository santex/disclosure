{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting in my hot tub looking at, what I preceived to be, Jupiter orVenus, about 845pm. It was partly cloudy and the planets kept disappearing andreappearing through the clouds. As I was looking at the sky, I noticed 3 brightwhite triangles moving across the sky. One in the lead and the other twoflanking either side of the first. At first glance, I thought it was birds, butId never seen birds flying so late at night and in such unison without faulter.As they disappeared into the clouds, I saw two more white triangles fall fromthe sky horizontally, parallel to eachother to the NE. Then, disappeared behindthe clouds."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Santa Cruz","There were no other sightings in Santa Cruz on or around April 20th 2004"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"2983","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.978847,+-122.028326(2983)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2983) map </A>","Latitude":"36.978847","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/20/2004 08:15 UTC","City":"Santa Cruz","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2983.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2983.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-122.028326","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Summary":"Three bright white triangles","Date Submitted":"04/20/2004 08:15 UTC","Region":"California"}
