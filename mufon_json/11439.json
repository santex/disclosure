{"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Summary":"Unusual activity by commercial aircraft over the Oxford Valley Mall, Middletown, PA for the last several years","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Middletown Township","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"40.173328","Tags":"City","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date Submitted":"07/05/2008 11:34 UTC","Case Number":"11439","divs":["sighting detailsto whom it may concern: i just wanted to drop you a note regarding the recent sightings over the oxford valley mall in middletown township, pennsylvania. not that what i'm about to share with you has any relationship to ufos exactly... however, i believe it could have some relationship to the strange activity happening in the skies over the middletown, pennsylvania. over the past several years now, there has been strange aerial activity occurring over the oxford valley mall on a regular basis. i first noticed this activity during the summer of 2001 and have brought my wife and daughters out to witness this activity, both at night and during the day. the activity i���������m referring to is the circling over our home by numerous commercial type planes on a regular basis. not surprisingly, my home is located less than a 1\\4 of a mile from the oxford valley mall in fairless hills, pennsylvania. the planes number from a minimum of 3, to a maximum of 6 aircraft; and are of a commercial civilian design - boeing 767, dc-8, dc-9, etc. typically, one aircraft flies at a noticeably lower altitude than the others, while all of them are simultaneously flying concentrically circular patterns over this general area (the area of the oxford valley mall) for periods of time of up to 1 hour. all the planes are jet planes, with one of them typically being a solid white color. the others have some blue markings on their tails and underbellies and are gray in color. one plane looks as though it may have a slight projection extending from the rear of the aircraft; and at least one plane is longer and thinner than the others... which are thicker and heavier in profile. the circles that are flown seem to cover a sizable geographical area, as it can take a single jet about 10 to 15 minutes to return to its starting point. the center of the circle seems to be located over that section of the rt. 1 corridor in which the mall is located. the frequency of these flights appears to be somewhat erratic. some years they occur 2 or 3 times a month for several months consecutively; other times they won���������t fly over for several months in a row. i first noticed the flights in circa 2001 during the late evening hours after dark. however, the flights take place at all times of the day and night. i've viewed them as late as midnight and during broad daylight in mid-afternoon as well; and they are continuing to be flown, as i've seen them flying at night as recent as a couple of weeks ago. on occasion i���������ve signaled to these aircraft with a flashlight at night and with a mirror during the day... just to let them know they're being seen. i���������ve also tried to take photographs of these planes, however, they are too far away for our digital camera to allow this to be accomplished. the planes many times appear to fly noticeably closer to one and other than is typical done. i mean, closer than what you would normally see when commercial planes fly overhead. once, during the summer of 2007 - while my wife and i were taking our evening walk near the oxford valley pool in fairless hills, pa - we actually thought two of the planes might collide. this incident took place during daylight hours at approximately 6:00 or 7:00 pm, although i don���������t remember the exact date. both planes were flying unusually low for planes of their size, however, their engine noise wasn't unusually loud. the altitude of these flights can be said to be unusual too, generally speaking, in that the the planes appear to be flying in slow spirals up and down as they circle. for your convenience i am enclosing an attachment of some notes i took last summer, during a daylight event which happened between noon and 4:00 pm, i hope you find it helpful. regards, si contino fairless hills, pa 19030"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11439.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11439_submitter_file2__img042.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11439.html"],"Longitude":"-74.885799","City":"Middletown Township","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07052008-0012","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.173328,+-74.885799(11439)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11439) map </A>","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
