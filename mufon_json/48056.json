{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAppeared from behind a tree line to the SW. We ovserved a single redish light for 3-5 minutes flying in a straint line towards the NE, passing directly over our heads at around 920 pm on June 9, 2013. There was no sound and was lower than most planes that land at our regional airport. Light finally just dissapeared while we were watching it. It wasn't a plane due to the one light and silence, not a flare which would have changed brightness. Was moving quicker than the small planes do. A few seconds after it disapeared a jet came into view (much, much higher) with the flashing lights and sound coming from it. Anyone have any thoughts, ideas as to what it could be?"],"Summary":"Straight flight, single redish light flew directly over us.","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"48056","Date of the Event":"06/09/2013 09:20 UTC","Latitude":"41.582154","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48056.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48056.html"],"Region":"Rhode Island","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06112013-0012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.582154,+-71.470939(48056)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48056) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-71.470939","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"06/11/2013 12:18 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
