{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI walked my friend to his vehicle. In my front yard, I looked up at the sky and pointed out a bright star-like light. I said, \"That's got to be Jupiter- cause Venus is over the horizon.\" I didn't get the words \"-cause Venus is...\" out of my mouth when I watched this light dim. It dimmed some more, and in a few seconds it was gone. My friend didn't look up in time to see it. It was stationary and was around the zenith point of the sky. The sky was cloudless. I watched for 10 minutes after this and did not see any re-appearance or anything else unusual. I'm sticking around to see the expected Perseid meteor shower, and I guess this could one of those things. But why so early? Would one lone meteorite be possibly coming in and burn out like that? If it was a meteorite, it would have to have been coming straight at my location to appear stationary as a planet or a star does. What's the likelihood of that happening? I'm just saying that what I saw."],"Summary":"Venus-like light dimmed and vanished.","City":"Fayetteville","Case Number":"25080","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-08132010-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.060354,+-78.873208(25080)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25080) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/12/2010 10:55 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:07","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Star-like","Longitude":"-78.873208","Latitude":"35.060354","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"North Carolina","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Fayetteville","There were no other sightings in Fayetteville on or around August 12th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25080.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25080.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/13/2010 12:06 UTC","Weather Factors":"None"}
