Second, these were not military nor civilian aircraft. There were no blinking lights, they defied the laws of physics, and they glowed -- in that the light seemed to emanate from within them than without - and were brighter than any star in the sky. All the craft were spherical. They seemed to mimic stars in their appearance. The first two craft traveled parallel to each other and in formation. They seemed to come from the low northeast, banked south, then headed northwest. The third sphere seemed to come from the north and moved in zig-zags. It also moved northwest, in the same general direction as the first two. This single sphere seemed to pause (from our POV) in the head of the constellation Draco for at least 3 seconds before continuing its flight. The last pair (totalling five spheres), also came from the northeast and in formation, traveled south. At one point in this pair's flight, one of the spheres paused in the sky (it did not move) while the other seemed to catch up to it. The movements and flight of these spheres was very fluid, as if they were traveling through water. They were, for lack of a better description, swimming in the sky. At times all five sphere���s light wavered into different colours, but with a soft transition between red and silver light. They DID NOT blink. Their light was constant. There was a total lack of sound. They also seemed to be flying outside of our atmosphere but not as far away as the moon. All five objects seemed to be following a definite flight pattern - but we must stress that the movements were soft - like watching swimmers. Slow.
