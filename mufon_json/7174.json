I was walking home from town,Chambersburg. It was about 3:00 in the morning. Something made me look up. There in front of me was two rectangular shapes, like sitting on top of each other, it was like two solid green lights. I stoped and stared at it in amazement. Then after a few seconds it took-off to the left and dissapered. Then a few seconds later I saw a green light way off in the distance,by the mountian range. It moved real fast to another spot, then it came back to where I was. I was frozen with fear wathching this. Another couple of seconds later, which felt like minuets, It started to fly away .It just got smaller and smaller until it was gone. I was only about 17 when this happened and didn't tell anyone cause I was afraid they would make fun of me and think I was crazy or making it up. So I never told anyone until just a few years ago. Can you help me ? All the UFO pictures I've seen are nothing like this.
