So I got up and walked outside. At first, it looked like the north star. As I became more aware of what was going on I realized that it was much bigger and to close to be a star. It was so bright and close to the water that it made a reflection in the water like the moon would but the moon was not out that night. I watched for maybe 30min to and hour and I had to go back to bed to so I could work that morning. My friend and two others stayed up till the sun came up and he said it stayed out the remainder of the night and continued to move in small circles or up and down slightly. It was off of cresent beach maybe a couple miles off shore."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09182007-0003","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.902164,+-81.306058(7934)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7934) map </A>","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in St Augustine","There were no other sightings in St Augustine on or around September 15th 2007"],"Longitude":"-81.306058"}
