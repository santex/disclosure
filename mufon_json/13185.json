As in a searing repetition, like it was getting stuck? I called out OH MY GOD! What IS that! Watched til it disappeared quickly. I ran inside and told my son and husband hoping they wouldn't think I have lost my mind."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Ohio","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Star-like","Latitude":"39.108318","Date Submitted":"10/22/2008 10:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13185.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13185.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.108318,+-84.50654(13185)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13185) map </A>","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Moved upwards at an angle heading west","Date of the Event":"10/22/2008 10:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"00:03:20","Case Number":"13185","trends":["There have been 82 other sightings in Cincinnati","There were no other sightings in Cincinnati on or around October 22nd 2008"]}
