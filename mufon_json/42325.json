in the long exposure we could see other dots of light around the larger brighter light that were in different locations and numbers in different pictures! i couldnt see these smaller objects with my naked eye. if you watched it you could see the jerky movements but it stayed in the general location... gradually ever so slowly it moved to the right and got smaller.. i presume it was moving away.. then those closer object we saw earlier came back up out of the western horizon and moved to the right in the sky, passing under the stationary object. i think the stationary object went dark for about a second or two when the other object showed up again and was near it. i was kind of in shock.. not sure.. then it started cruising slowly east again but this time on the back side of our house... so: up out of the western horizon.. maybe 20 degress... moves to the right in the western sky (going north), then gradually in a slow curve moves east until out of site. seemed about same height... by this time my wife had gone back in the house to get ready for bed as we had watched the stationary object and took pitures for about half an hour. i grabbed her when the first object came back and she saw it again with me... not as close this time but clearly lights flashing in a rotating pattern.. i think red blue and white.. not sure.. pretty sure blue and white.. stationary objct is meanwhile looking farther away and i had to move my camera tripod to see it better which is when i realized it definitely was slowly moving to the right (northish), and down, or away.. i finally just came in to look at my pictures and was very very pleased :) i have a couple of other pictures as well that are also good..ive included the picture ending in 498.jpg that shows the object in the sky and part of our house so you can get a sense of how far away it was.. most pics are at the cameras max zoom (20x). what i was hoping for and did get is the objects movement trail that is recorded as going in different direction streaks that the other objects and stars in the pictures.. proving no camera shake was to blame.. i was using a tripod.. the exposure times are in the exif data.. i experimented.. 10-60 seconds.. one of the pics of the hovering object shows it separated as two lights.."],"Date of the Event":"09/05/2012 09:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.32696,+-72.633281(42325)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42325) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-09052012-0021","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-72.633281","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42325.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42325_submitter_file1__L1000487.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42325_submitter_file2__L1000488.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42325_submitter_file3__L1000490.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42325_submitter_file4__L1000491.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/42325_submitter_file5__L1000498.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42325.html"]}
