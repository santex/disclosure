Looked like distant stars. Nothing different than tiny stars except rapid movement. About 20 degrees above the horizon. I was looking out of my window and noticed them. They were not there when I was looking out of my window 5 minutes before. Noticed 2:45 am. Zoomed upwards at high speed to 45 degrees from horizon in one second and then moved left and right repeatedly by about three cm if taken one foot from my face, then dropped rapidly. First two and then a third. The two seemed to be roughly the same distance apart at first, then moved apart. 3am, continuing to watch. Still moving rapidly across the sky. NASA desk and Petersen AFB desk closed due to US government shutdown. Not good job guys."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51352.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51352.html"],"Case Number":"51352","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00"}
