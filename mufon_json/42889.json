{"Summary":"bright light seen at sunrise in SE sky","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-91.897754","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside having a smoke when I looked east towards sunrise and to the south, or, right of the sunrise I noticed a very bright star-like light in the sky that seemed to sort of hover. It was also sort of a silvery light. I ran in house to grab camera and when I got back out it had dimmed then got bright again and as I attempted to get picture of it, my batteries went dead (which had been going dead). Then it seemed to just disappear and when I asked it to please show it's self again it reappeared. I ran into house to grab cell phone and tried to get video and pics, but it kept disappearing when I tried filming or taking a pic. Then a cloud cover came and it appeared to go in and out of the cloud. I don't know if I have anything captured on cam yet, but will inspect pics and footage I did get later. Oh,and, My heart seemed to be racing really fast during whole sighting. Very strange but am unsure of what I was actually seeing, however, I know it was nothing like anything I've seen before!"],"Date Submitted":"09/29/2012 10:12 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.476578,+-91.897754(42889)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42889) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Independence","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Iowa","Log Number":"US-09292012-0013","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42889.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42889.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"42.476578","City":"Independence","Date of the Event":"09/29/2012 07:15 UTC","Case Number":"42889","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
