The direction was south, towards Kiel from Strande. The lights in all 3 photos were not visible with the naked eye and no sounds were heard. Two people were with me while I shot the photos, and neither one of them saw or heard anything. I noticed the lights after viewing the first frame, by looking at the LCD on the back of the camera (Nikon D40). This camera is IR sensitive, which made me think that maybe the camera had captured something not normally visible. The other possibility would be a reflection inside the lens of the camera.
