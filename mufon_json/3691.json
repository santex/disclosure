{"divs":["Sighting Details1. I was on my roof dinning with some friends 2. my wife had noticed the same thing at 9:55 am moving to the south west, it was near a airplane flying low so it look very different from it. 3. I am an amateur astronomer and i am used to watching the sky, this was just like nothing i have seen before, mainly by its speed, and the fact that i see it appear and despair in the middle of the sky, it seemed to me that it was kind of low maybe a 1000 feet. 4. it seemed to have a \"body\" of some sort of some yellowish color, with a very bright white flashing light, it move in a straight line, faster than anything i've ever seen. 5. i was startled and told my wife and friend about it right away. 6. the object despaired in mid sky as quick as it had appeared, which made it really strange, there are many plane and helicopters flying over, manhattan, so these two could be easily ruled out"],"Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-74.001133","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.719593,+-74.001133(3691)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3691) map </A>","Summary":"extremely fast moving object with bright flashing white light moving to th north from the south","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around August 3rd 2005"],"Case Number":"3691","Object Shape":"Oval","Date of the Event":"08/03/2005 10:53 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/03/2005 10:53 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"New York","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"40.719593","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08042005-0003","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3691.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3691.html"],"City":"New York"}
