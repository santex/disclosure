Pretty slow. So I said \"oh my god. Hold on\" & I got up & walked closer to the trees so I could try to get a picture. Then that was when I saw the second one behind the trees. The second was was bright green, and then would fade in & out of red & green. But the other one just stayed green. They sat there for a minute or two, then kept crossing each other back & forth. Then just vanished. The whole thing lasted about 5 minutes. I immediately thought UFO ! I was kind of scared & shocked for a while after it happened. I keep wondering what it was that could've been that bright of a green ! It looked like the color of a green street light, but obviously it wasn't because it was moving & it was too high to be a street light !"],"Case Number":"41443","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.633564,+-122.497291(41443)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41443) map </A>","Latitude":"45.633564","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere","Date of the Event":"08/04/2012 08:30 UTC","Longitude":"-122.497291","Country":"United States","City":"Vancouver"}
