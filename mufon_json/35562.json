I looked up at the sky because i had seen a bright light then i realize the aircraft was still there. I thought it was a helicopter so we drove closer to the residential area and lowered the windows to see if it made any sound. The craft was hover silently eerily. Then proceeded to move west toward Las Cruces, NM. We decided to drive in the direction the craft was going. We noticed 1 other car who stopped to the side of the road to look at the object we kept following it but it seemed to be moving fast we were going around 40 mph. We followed it all through downtown El Paso. It seemed to be flying in between the border of El Paso and Juarez. My boyfriend is retired military and he strongly believed that it couldn't of been a military craft let alone a helicopter since he had been in various black-hawks before. We lost sight of the object due to traffic and the fact that it kept going at a steady pace west."],"Latitude":"29.57146","trends":[],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35562.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35562.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
