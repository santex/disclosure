Looked at the dark sky to gaze at stars and saw this white light object moving slowly in a straight traveling in a northerly direction. Knew this was no airplane of any sort because this object did not have any beacon light and I knew this also was no shooting or falling star. I watched this object for about 10 to 15 seconds when this object flat out disappeared. I watch an gaze at stars all the time but I wasn't startled but shocked. I kept thinking what just happened and kept thinking I can not explain this. Never experienced anything like this."]}
