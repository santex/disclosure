I knew it was a ufo, from memory and feeling, I was excited, my fianc'e could only stare in amazement as she had always wanted to see something like it. We knew instantly that it was no firework as it moved horizontally, emitted a faint hum and stayed in place after a time as though observing the neighborhood well above the treeline. I then told my fianc'e to run and get our camera so we could document it. In the time it took her to run and get our camera, the first light disappeared from sight once it ascended vertically. As she came back out of our house with our camera, another light identically in all ways, (Movement, appearance and sound) appeared and she took 4 images of the light. It then ascended vertically and disappeared just as the first had."],"Latitude":"38.481444","Log Number":"US-08102011-0022","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"07/04/2011 09:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None"}
