At first I thought it was a plane, but then noticed it had no red or white flashing lights as all planes have. The skies where clear At the same moment I noticed a plane flying from Est to West, South of me, the plane was located above the river and was getting ready to land as it was descending and was about 20KM away from the Montreal���Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and when I was comparing the two, I was positive what I saw moving above me it was not a plane. The only thing I can compare it to is it looked exactly like a star and it was flying across the sky with a bright white shine like a start has, giving it a round star shape. It was much higher in altitude then any plane and looked a little bigger but very high in the sky right above me and moving a fast at a constant speed. I observed it for more then 20 sec, then I knew this was not a Meteor. That is when I decided to get my 5 Megapixel camera and film it. I was filming for about 25sec, and then the flying star simply faded away and disappeared. My impression if you would want to draw it out on a map, to give you an idea of the trajectory: the start shape was moving from Val-Des-Monts QC to Sherbrook QC."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.659733,+-73.593411(48307)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48307) map </A>","City":"Laval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48307.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48307.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"06/19/2013 10:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Laval","There were no other sightings in Laval on or around June 19th 2013"]}
