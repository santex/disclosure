Ran to living room to view more closely - object was just above neighbors house not high enough above to be a plane or other normal flying object. Reminded me of a Luminiara the way it lighted from the inside. It moved quickly yet silently from the position over the house toward the west then back eastward. It finally just went poof and disappeared in the Easterly direction. It maintained an orange color with yellow center the entire time."],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.24128","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/25/2012 12:10 UTC"}
