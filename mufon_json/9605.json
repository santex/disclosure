A few miles out of town the road goes into a canyon and there are power-lines that cross over and above the road. As i was approx. a half a mile from the power lines I saw what looked like a large hook come out from the bottom of a cloud and travel just above the power lines, in the same direction, untill they went over the top of the mountain and out of my sight.. The whole thing lasted only 5-10 seconds. I called the local power co.when I got back home and asked if there was any unusual activity around the time that I saw this object and they said no.. I travel this road almost on a daily basis and have never seen it again , nor had I seen it before that time. I do look now each and every time I travel the road wheather it is day or night at those power lines. I'll never forget what I saw there and it will continue to mystify me forever."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/23/2005 10:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Other","City":"Philipsburg","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/23/2005 10:00 UTC","Summary":"saw an object come out of a cloud.fish-hook like in appearence","Latitude":"46.333056","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Philipsburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"9605","Region":"Montana","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9605.html"]}
