We observed a very large, silent, V shaped craft that had red flashing lights around its perimeter. It was moving South to North. Since we live in a home which has a hilltop view, we are accustomed to watching various aircraft nightly. This was nothing like we have seen before. We called our 13 yr old son, and his friend, and together, we watched the craft as it flew over the valley."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Calabasas","There were no other sightings in Calabasas on or around November 14th 2008"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"11/14/2008 06:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.142023,+-118.659833(13714)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13714) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-11142008-0012","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
