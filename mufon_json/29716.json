Thinking someone set of an fireworks rocket , i peeked thru the front shutters and noted no more activity. I wanted to go outside to investigate further but got an erie feeling about it and did not do so. Upon retiring, i kept feeling an uncomfortable sensation like there was a prescence and could not rest. I ended up turning the tv on to be able to fall asleep. The next day i looked out that same window, and noticed my neighbors tree was blocking the veiw of the sky at a 45 degree angle 11 o'clock and the two story home at 9 o'clock. Thus what ever it was had to be directly overhead. The second night came and i still felt an uneasiness and had to turn on the tv again to be able to rest. I cant explain what it was. But something is forcing me to record this. What sticks with me is the colors of the light,i have never see anything like it."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":[]}
