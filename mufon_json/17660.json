I looked toward the sky and saw what apeared to be a falling star. one problem was the falling star was falling sideways or flat not down like a typical falling star. I continued to watch and as it came closer to the earth. then I noticed it was not a falling star but seamed to be on fire. after falling for a second or two it stoped falling and took off at an incredible rate of speed. The pattern was like a check mark in the sky. the direction of the craft was north to south. Now I have seen airplanes or jets and this was definatly not afterburner. After thinking about this the past few days I feel that the craft was crash landing and then regained control. again this was no aircraft the human body could not with stand the speed and force this craft was producing."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Tucson","There was one other sighting in Tucson on or around June 23rd 2009"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Arizona","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Falling star.","Latitude":"32.227923","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.227923,+-110.920199(17660)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17660) map </A>","Case Number":"17660","Date Submitted":"06/23/2009 03:53 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
