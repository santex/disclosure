Son came from outside to tell me to come see something weird in sky. Went out to road so there were no obstructions. (We are in the country. Dirt road, expansive dark sky, etc) Stood and watched a bright, fuzzy edged roundish light moving from south to north across the sky. Appeared to be faintly pulsating. Deviated a couple times from straight line flight. Moving to the left and right. Slower moving than planes I've seen. Did not hear any sound. Kept watching until it seemed to pulsate or extinguish into nothing."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"red/orange lightly pulsating bright light s to n flight path with a few l to r deviations. 3 minutes. seemed to vanish or extinguish into nothingness","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.180047","Country":"United States","City":"Montrose","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.180047,+-83.888093(50146)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50146) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Longitude":"-83.888093","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-08252013-0011"}
