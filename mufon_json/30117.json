My son noticed a really bright orange light in sky. It was still a little daylight so he thought that odd something so bright in the sky. He watched it & thought it was a plane at first, the closer it got the more he figured out it was not a plane. He is an A & P mechanic so he knows what a plane looks like. This was just a really bright orange light. It came from the East & went West over us. It had no sound. It had no other lights on it. It was about 3,000 feet up. It was going real slow. After it went over it started to fade out then just disappeared. It made a believer out of him. I'd been telling him for years since my 2001 sighting there were things out there unexplainable. It left you wondering what the heck did I just see."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.447039,+-95.708315(30117)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30117) map </A>","Latitude":"36.447039","Summary":"Orange light really bright moving across sky","Case Number":"30117","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Oologah","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
