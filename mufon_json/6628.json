At first I thought it to be an incoming aircraft, but it moved so very slowly as other aircraft came and went. It was brighter and much larger than any star in the sky. So my next guess was that it might be Venus, but it was much larger and definitely moving. I called a friend to verify that it was really there and that I wasn't imagining things. It slowly moved upward above the tree line, then to the right, then to the left, down, back to the right, then up again until it began to fade up into the sky - not down as it would have if it were simply going farther over the horizon or over the mountains. This object remained visible for exactly one hour until it moved upward and faded out."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.744934,+-104.976953(6628)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6628) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"6628","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/25/2007 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6628.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6628.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
