i know what i saw. i know others saw what i saw. i just don't know what they were. true definition i suppose - unidentified - flying - objects. not saying they were from space, just that there was nothing out of nasa's fort sumner balloon experiments (even though they moved unlike and balloon i have ever seen) and pretty uncharacteristic of anything kirtland does. hoping others that witnessed it have theories or different perspectives to develop a better picture (or maybe an actual picture?)"],"Summary":"three pulsating star-like objects in mid-day and a larger translucent oblong sphere","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06022013-0008","Date Submitted":"06/02/2013 03:27 UTC","City":"Albuquerque","trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were no other sightings in Albuquerque on or around May 18th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47802.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47802.html"],"Longitude":"-106.636971","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"35.095646","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"New Mexico","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None"}
