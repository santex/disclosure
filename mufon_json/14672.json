We saw a very bright red light that appeared to be still for about 4-5 minutes and then moved very slowly from North to Southwest. It appeared to stop for several more minutes and then continued curving slightly to the South, and then just disappeared. We thought that it might be a blimp with some kind of lighted advertising on it for the midnight revelers (that wasn't visible to us) but there was no sound and it appeared to be very high for that type of thing. Also, we could determine no flashing lights, which I believe is a requirement for FAA aircraft. Just after it vanished in the clear night, we saw an commercial airplane in a regular flight plan that was crossing into approximately the same area of the sky where the light was last seen before it disappeared."],"Latitude":"32.776949","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in La Mesa","There were no other sightings in La Mesa on or around January 1st 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-117.016064","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/01/2009 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"14672","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"01/01/2009 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Very bright red lights in clear night sky, moving slowly from East to West.","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14672.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14672.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-01012009-0018"}
