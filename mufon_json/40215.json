The light traveled in a straight-line path. Twice, I turned away from it, and when I looked back it had not progressed as far as it should have given the speed at which it was traveling when I looked at it. This is the fourth time we have witnessed these lights. Each time they are traveling along the exact same path. On 03 July, we observed similar objects. On 30 Jun, there were two of them in sequence, which were also seen by our neighbors. I have a couple video clips of these on my cellphone but the quality is too poor to make out any details. A couple of weeks before 30 Jun was the first time we saw these, around 2am. The first time there were two of them traveling together, and one did deviate from the straight-line pathway and floated slowly straight down before continuing on. A third single orb floated by a little while later. Upon first sight, I thought perhaps they were hot air balloons because there was a fiery red-orange glow that sometimes flickered or pulsed, and because one of the lights floated straight down. I looked on the Internet to see if there were any sort of nighttime balloon rides going on but couldn't find anything. As I previously mentioned, in all of these sightings the lights had the same bearing, due east toward Lake St. Clair. They were NOT heading toward Selfridge ANG which would be to the northeast. Although it seemed like the lights were coming from objects, I could not make out any details of the objects on any occasions."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/05/2012 11:27 UTC","Log Number":"US-07052012-0048","Object Shape":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.494759,+-83.099983(40215)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40215) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:40 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Madison Heights","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.494759","Case Number":"40215"}
