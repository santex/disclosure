I noticed something in the sky as I was looking thru the windshield the object came close enough to were I could see a silver cylinder shape with no windows. I also noticed a jet in the sky and the silver cylinder object was moving (from west to east in a straight direction) faster then the jet ( which was moving east to west and further above the object). I was on the phone with my boyfriend explaining to him what it looked like and told him I was hanging up because I have a older phone and can't take pictures and talk at the same time. But I was too slow and the object disappeared."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10"}
