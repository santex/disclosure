It was some really bright object going way faster than any plane, It was so white that it looked blue. IT was around midnight to 1am i dont know the exact time. I noticed the object because it was so bright, I thought it was a meteorite but ive seen two of them so far in my life and this one was way faster than other meteorites i've seen. I see shooting stars a lot, nothing like that, I see planes here all the time, nothing like that. It went from the sky downwards straight down, not across the sky from east to west. it looked like it went pass the earth and satellites. I see the ISS pass in the sky and other satellites, It was nothing like I have ever seen. I'm glad i witnessed it. I lost sight of the object when it went past the horizon towards Philadelphia or the ocean"],"Object Shape":"Flash, Other, Unknown","Case Number":"21494","Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.209052","Date of the Event":"01/14/2010 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Like an orb flying pass the earth extremley fast, lit up entire sky, Saw out my window","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.209052,+-77.193485(21494)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21494) map </A>","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
