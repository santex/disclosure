At 0030hours I observed some lights that I thought was an airplane coming from thenorth heading in my direction. The object kept getting closer and closer to mylocation. I was just about to move the patrol car, because I thought the objectwas going to crash. At this time the lights stopped and hovered for a fewseconds, then in the snap of a fingure it was gone. I did not say anything tomy ride-a-long, basically because I did not know what to say. But before Icould think of anything to say my ride-a-long says Did you justsee them lights over there. The lights where white in color most of the timebut would show other faint colors, and was in the shape of a triangle. Thelights were not flashing, and I could not hear anything coming from the objectwhich was about 200 yards away.Also about a month ago, another police officer who had a possible drunk stopped,saw the same thing hovering a few miles from their location."],"Date Submitted":"03/09/2003 12:00 UTC","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.019282,+-98.481846(2603)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2603) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2603.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2603.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Latitude":"39.019282","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"2603","Region":"Kansas","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
