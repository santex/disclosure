I left the deck to get a better look and followed the object from horizon to horizon as best as the trees would let me see. I strained to hear any engine sound but heard none. After the object became obscured by the trees I made sure to verify the conditions and time, the sky was overcast. I tried to did miss what I had seen while observing the weather condition and saw the same color and size objected following the same course speed and heading. I followed the second object until it was obscured by the trees and listing for some type of engine sound but heard nothing. I don't think it makes a difference on my sighting but we were experiencing a partial power outage at the time."],"Date of the Event":"08/03/2013 03:48 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.629403,+-83.570667(49408)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49408) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"49408","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49408.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49408.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"orange silent movied west to east followed by a second sighting on same path","City":"Toledo","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Toledo","There were no other sightings in Toledo on or around August 3rd 2013"]}
