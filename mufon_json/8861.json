I was looking around on the partly cloudy day, and noticed a green light. It stayed briefly and then moved VERY fast behind clouds. It wasn't a reflection or anything of the sort, and it was too small to be a plane. I was shocked, and assumed it was a UFO... I still have no explanation for it."],"Latitude":"41.315183","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8861.html"],"City":"New Haven","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/08/2006 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Green light, fast moving","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.315183,+-72.918428(8861)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8861) map </A>","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in New Haven","There were no other sightings in New Haven on or around March 8th 2006"],"Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere","Region":"Connecticut","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
