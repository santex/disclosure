I was facing west and this thing was coming from the south heading north. My son, daughter, neighbor and husband saw it and we were able to take pics and video. The object was so slow and LOW made no noise and lasted long enough thay we all had enough time to get our phones on it...It definitely moved in a very controlled manner. It was in our view for approximately 1 minute!!! It seemed to be slowly ascending then speeded up and then it was gone as if it was never there."],"Case Number":"47246","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.82931,+-73.108801(47246)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47246) map </A>","Longitude":"-73.108801","Date Submitted":"05/07/2013 05:57 UTC","Region":"Vermont","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"St. Albans","Object Features":"None, Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St. Albans","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Summary":"Bright saucer like object!!!","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date of the Event":"05/06/2013 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"44.82931"}
