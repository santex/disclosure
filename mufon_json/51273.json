It was a bright bright light in the shape of a cigar about the size of a medium airplane, with no wings or tail. It was like neon light but brighter. I was going to get my binoculars but I had my glasses on and could see it quite clearly. I was staring at it and it was as if a cloud came in front of it, but no clouds were in the air and it disappeard for a couple of seconds then reappeared in the same position. As I watched, it stayed for maybe another minute and then a turbulence of air seemed to come from the north end of it and it disappeared."],"Date of the Event":"10/01/2013 07:05 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51273.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51273.html"],"trends":["There have been 76 other sightings in Calgary","There were no other sightings in Calgary on or around October 1st 2013"],"Log Number":"CA-10022013-0017","Case Number":"51273","City":"Calgary","Date Submitted":"10/02/2013 07:45 UTC","Longitude":"-114.034706","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"51.05019"}
