I looked up and what at first I thought was a commercial aircraft flying north around a heading of 030 degrees. I thought that it was flying to slow and to low and I started to look at it a little closer. There were no wings or tail section and it didnt make a sound. As it flew north a tree got in my way so I moved over a little to my right to keep watching it and it was then that it vanished. I then looked to my right and here comes another one. It was the same thing. It was like the first one was towing the second one. I no that airplanes don't fly that low or that close to each other. I would like to talk to someone about this."]}
