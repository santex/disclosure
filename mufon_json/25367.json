I was starting to unload the back of my SUV and I saw a bright light in the sky. I first thought it was an airplane since we see them regularly. Pittsburgh International Airport is close by. This was brighter than usual and for as large as it was, there was no sound. The night was dark and partly overcast. I watched the object move slowly to the east, toward Pittsburgh. It moved steadily, so I continued to look for flashing lights or other color light but saw only a whitish ball. It moved similarly to what I remember satellites to look like in the sky, just much, much brighter and it was moderately large in size. As I watched for about 20 sec or so, the object turned completely red and became pale. It stayed red for just a few seconds then seemed to taper off and completely disappear. I watched and listened for another few minutes and saw and heard nothing from the object. I did see other aircraft circling the airport sky...three I believe in different points in the sky and at various altitudes. My last thought was that it was something from the airshow that is in town this weekend, but once again, there was no sound and I'm moderately familiar with both commercial and military aircraft from seeing them often throughout the years. I am certain it wasn't a meteor, it moved too slow. I'm not sure what I saw tonight but it sure was interesting."],"Summary":"Slow moving, silent, white/yellow ball of light, turns red and disappears.","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"25367","trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around September 10th 2010"],"Longitude":"-79.992306","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25367.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25367.html"],"Latitude":"40.444625","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.444625,+-79.992306(25367)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25367) map </A>"}
