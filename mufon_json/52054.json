{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","City":"Tory Hill","Summary":"Huge glowing light, goes out and either that or airplane seen leaving area","divs":["Sighting DetailsI could see out my window at 5:30AM a huge, glowing oblong or tear-shaped orb that I knew after a second couldn't be a star. My mind tried to identify it as a planet and a star lined up among other things that might be brighter than a star, then it vanished and I could see what looked like an airplane flying from around that area - unsure now whether that small craft was the glowing orb changed, came from the orb, or just a bystander airplane. I only saw a few minutes tops of this, I have no idea how long the huge glowing object was in the sky."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ontario","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Tory Hill","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.972806,+-78.2747(52054)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52054) map </A>","Country":"Canada","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Case Number":"52054","Log Number":"CA-11052013-0006","Longitude":"-78.2747","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Date of the Event":"11/05/2013 05:30 UTC","Latitude":"44.972806","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52054.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52054.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/05/2013 06:12 UTC"}
