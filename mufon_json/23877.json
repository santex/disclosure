I saw my first U.F.O. wow!!! It was low on the horizon and I could gage the movements by the neighbors garage roof line. It seemed to just be scanning and moving around slowly.It was very far away and appeared small like the size of a star when looking up at the night sky. It appeared to glow and pulsate with light. I kept moving my chair every 5 minutes to the left about 4=5 feet at a time. I watched for about 20 minutes and then went in. I was hoping for it to take off fast like I see on videos and read about. It was not as exciting as I thought it would be. I wonder if it was us or them?
