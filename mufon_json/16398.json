These two red orbs were pulsing on and off at a rate of about 20 -30 times a minute. The on to off timing was uniformly equal and pulsing in unison. The size of the red orbs were slightly smaller than your thumbnail held at arms��� length and the shape was perfectly circular with a very defined edge, no fuzziness or light diffusion. The distance between the two orbs was approximately the width of your fist at arms��� length. There was some relative motion between the two objects: the one on the left appeared steady on its course while the one on the right changed its altitude dipping down and then back to its level position. As I continued driving due west the objects appeared to be drifting to the left or southward and now the roadway was turning slightly northward to a west-north-west heading and the view of the objects were being obstructed by trees. I thought I would pull over and stop to watch these red orbs and continued forward to have a clearer view now appearing through my side window. The clear view was now coming up, but before I pulled off to the shoulder there appeared what I would describe as a burst from between and above the plane of the two orbs not unlike a jet going supersonic with its wing producing a shock wave. I had traveled about a mile in this episode so it was visible to me for about one minute. I continued onward where the road crosses over the railroad tracks to view southward the moonless night sky but could see no lights or movement there. In review of this event I could not make any determination of the distance, speed, or direction involved or if any sound was made as my car windows were closed. Looking at a map of the area shows that when I first sighted the object it could have been over Rhome, Aurora or Boyd, or beyond by 100���s of miles, or it could have been just beyond the tree line right over hwy 287 just a mile in front of me. At the time, I thought the direction of travel was southward, but who���s to say that I was actually seeing it departing straight away from me (west) on just a slight southward track. If that were true perhaps those who reside in Newark, Azle, Reno, or Springtown may have seen this occurrence. I was a passive observer of this non-threatening event and I know of no other witnesses as traffic was very, very light and the only other car well ahead did not stop."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.061806,+-97.462786(16398)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16398) map </A>","Case Number":"16398","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/26/2009 10:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Rhome","There were no other sightings in Rhome on or around February 26th 2009"],"Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-04042009-0001","Country":"United States"}
