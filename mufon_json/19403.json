I was looking in the eastern sky at about 45degrees. It had just recently become dusk and there could have been no sun reflection. I then saw a white cloud shaped like a long length wise trapezoid. I was looking at it for a about 15 seconds until it disappeared completely. It was very bright, almost like a thrust cloud from something going straight up. It was large in the sky, but not too high in the atmosphere. I immediately got my friend out to look at it as it was disappearing. I could not see any objects moving or otherwise around the cloud like thing. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky."],"Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Towson","There was one other sighting in Towson on or around September 19th 2009"]}
