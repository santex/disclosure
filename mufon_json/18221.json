After a couple of minutes of watching the ISS, we spotted another object traveling in the opposite direction about 5 degrees further WSW of the ISS. The object traveled about twice as fast and much brighter. Also, unlike the ISS lights which appear to blink, this object's light didn't blink at all - the illumination was very constant. We went outside and continued to watch it for a total of 1:30 minutes. It then disappeared as it reached the height of the western sky."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-88.060381","Tags":"City","Summary":"object appeared at same time as ISS fly by.
