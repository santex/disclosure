It was mid afternnon and no one elso around. I noticed a shiney sphere about 6 inches in diameter floating slowly down the road in the distance. I thought it might be some sort of remote control toy. I stopped the car and sat staring at this silvery irridesent ball coming towards me. It stopped right in front of my windshield as if checking me out also. After about 10 seconds it floated over my car and continued down the canyon road. I never felt in danger or threatened. I told a few people, but was just laughed at so I never spoke of it again. I was wondering if anyone else has had this same experience?"],"Log Number":"US-11012008-0001","Summary":"I came face to face with a floating sphere","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13454.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13454.html"],"Weather Factors":"None"}
