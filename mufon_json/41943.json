{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was outside smoking a ciggarette,an i live in the country so the sky is very clear and noticed a plane off in distance that seemed to hold my attention(probaly becasue i had nothing better to do)and as it moved along it just stopped for less than 30 seconds or so and then continued its same path and then it cut backwards at a 45 degree angle which no plane can do it was not a helicopter it was a white colored craft that was completly lite less then a mile from me and then headed out of my vision over the tree line,i walked to the end of my driveway to see if i could spot it again,which my driveway is about 100 yards and looking down the road it was just stationary about a half mile from where i was standing i am a brave person but i did not like this anymore and felt paranoid and quickly went back inside all this took place in about a five or six minute period i told all of this to my brother and we went back outside but saw nothing"],"Date Submitted":"08/22/2012 05:54 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"41943","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"looked like plane in distance,then made 45 angle turn backwards like no plane can","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.982054,+-83.814753(41943)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41943) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08222012-0018","City":"Cordele","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Cordele","There were no other sightings in Cordele on or around August 21st 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/21/2012 01:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Egg","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-83.814753","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Georgia","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"31.982054","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41943.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41943.html"]}
