At first I thought they were planes until I put on my sunglasses and noticed they did not have any wings and the sun reflected off of the shell. My girlfriend was like wow those are ufos, they cannot be planes. This grouping was in perfect formation and all were skipping while flying. Almost like a rock skipping across water. They flew up and down while moving forward while still in formation. They were also flying really low about 40 feet above the tree line. I was about .25 mile away from the formation so I got a really good visual of what it was, or what it looked like. I drove about 2 miles down the road where the birmingham international airport is to the right of me which would be east. And wouldn't you know a F-16 flys out going to the west really fast. I guess after what I saw. What we saw was not from here."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.405387,+-86.811378(20250)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20250) map </A>","Object Features":"Dome","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hoover","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Group of 4 ufos","Date of the Event":"11/01/2009 12:14 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON"}
