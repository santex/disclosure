Beam of green light as a laser beam. Divides itself in three dots, travels into space disappears, return forms a streak and divides itself in two, then join the original green light, forms a streak returns into space appears again... First sight during late night in the winter. Second sight during spring, third sight tonight. Same behaviors with small variations. Clearly to the naked eye. Not a comet, not a laser beam. It divides itself and the two other light joins in the larger green light. Travels into space and repeats it's patterns randomly. My observations last about an hour or more. Intriguing and clear. During the first sight,winter, it left a long trail of green light. Tonight i lost sight when it entered space and did not return after half an hour watching. Twice I saw it by myself as it was late into the night, past 1 a.m. Tonight I called a friend, because people said I was seeing things. Now I have a witness! It's beautiful!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"30405","Object Features":"Other","Region":"Colorado","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.018043,+-105.255965(30405)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30405) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30405.html"],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Boulder","There were no other sightings in Boulder on or around July 28th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-08072011-0053","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","Summary":"Green strike in the sky, dividing itself in three green dots, joining each other to form one green light"}
