I opened my blinds as I normally do, looked outside and saw a white orb just flying horizontal and then disappeared. I called him over to see it also, he saw it. Then I put on my pants and went to the screened porch and noticed a second one, same size (white orb) taking the same path and then it just disappeared. A lot quicker then the first one. Waited around for 20 more minutes to see if I noticed another one. Nothing else."],"City":"Garner","Date of the Event":"10/26/2011 06:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/26/2011 08:17 UTC"}
