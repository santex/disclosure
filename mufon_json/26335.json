As I looked closer, they seemed to look \"funny\" somehow. They also seemed to be tumbling as a group in the sky and I realized they were moving too fast, unless there was a high speed wind up where they were. There was no breeze or wind on the ground. Later I realized that as they had been heading directly for the Pacific ocean, the wind would have been blowing from West to East, so they would have been traveling against the wind. I grabbed my camera (a Canon T2i with a Tamron 300mm lens), ran outside and looked over the roof of my house where I estimated the object would have have reached by then, on the basis of extrapolating its motion from my window. But I could not see it anywhere. I was shocked by this. I could not believe something so clearly visible could have simply disappeared in a cloudless clear blue sky and so I carefully searched the entire sky area but had to conclude it was gone!! I then searched back to the East where I had first seen it from inside my house ��������� closer to the horizon and there it was again, apparently in the same position and traveling at the same speed and slowly tumbling. I began to try to get pictures and video of the object as it crossed the sky in about 3 minutes. My first view of it was at an angle of about a 45 degrees to the East and I lost sight of it when it became too small a point to see or to photograph in the West. Looking at a map later I saw that it would appear to have traveled slightly to the north of Los Angeles International Airport and then continued out over the ocean. I was able to get two sharp photos but no video. Using Photoshop I zoomed the images of the object out to 300% and then cut and pasted one image next to the other for comparison. You can see that the object has rotated. I saved these two blown up images in one file and I then reduced the size of the original image to give an idea of its size of the object's appearance in the sky. If the object had been viewable by radar, I am sure that LAX will have a clear record of its movements."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Inglewood","There were no other sightings in Inglewood on or around November 3rd 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Inglewood","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
