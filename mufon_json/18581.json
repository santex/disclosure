i just cannot explain what they were. it s difficult to get across the speed these things carried out the display of movement and acceleration, i have seen nothing like this before.."],"Date Submitted":"07/29/2009 01:00 UTC","Summary":"Sighting of three very bright orange lights accompanied by one much larger light","Tags":"City","City":"Kerkira","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Log Number":"GP-08102009-0007","Country":"Greece","Longitude":"19.919585"}
