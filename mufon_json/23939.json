What caught my attention was it had no vapor trail. I watched as it moved behind a high thin cloud (partially cloudy sky with mostly thin wispy clouds) and it stopped moving forward. This really stirred my curiosity so I continued watching it. The cloud moved from in front of it it stood still for at least 30 sec. and then it began climbing at a right angle to its previous direction (up and to the west). The object moved slower than an airliner and slowly got smaller until I could no longer see it. Later that day I observed an airliner in about the same area of the sky and observed that it did leave a vapor trail and was traveling just above the clouds at about the same alttitude as the object. What really struck me was the difference in size of the airliner and the object I had seen earlier. I would have to estimate the size of the unknown object as at least 10 times the size of a commercial airliner. While watching the airliner I observed that as it moved away from me it appeared to move in a downward direction due to the curvature of the earth whereas the unidentified object moved up and to the left (west) as it grew smaller confirming that it was gaining altitude as if faded away. The object was metallic in appearance and was possible cigar shaped, as it changed direction I didn���t see any wings like you would see on a banking airline.The full impact of what I saw didn���t really register until I observed the jetliner later that day and confirmed that what I saw didn���t resemble it in either size or behavior."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-121.265047","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder","Case Number":"23939","Summary":"Bright metalic object possible cigar or cylinder shaped."}
