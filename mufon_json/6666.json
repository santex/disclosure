Longitude: 34��� 53', West +3GMT) I was relaxing in a hammock at my veranda at the 6th floor facing South, 100 m from the beach (to the left, East direction). The night was warm with a clear sky, apart from a few very small clouds (probably not dense \"stratus\", about 2000 m). Suddenly, I've noticed two, not so bright, amber orange objects traveling at very high speed from West towards East in a sort of \"erratically\" side by side path. I was astonished and could hardly breath. Then I've noticed they were both cross-shaped with faint lights at the extremities and neon like beams of light connecting the pair of lights to form the cross - there was also a very discrete orange glow around each craft. The UFOs turned right at a wide angle towards Southeast, while one crossed below the other and from that point they kept perfect parallel paths, without the previous random components, traveling straight. I could observe them at that moment passing above or through a small cloud. By estimating the angular size of the objects (~1���=~0.018radian) and multiplying this by the estimated high of that kind of cloud we guess they measured length=~2000m x 0.018radian=36 m which turns up to be about 111 ft. I'd called my husband but by the time he understood where to look and what for, he could not see anything as they were too far away."],"Longitude":"-34.861051","trends":["There have been no other sightings in João Pessoa","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
