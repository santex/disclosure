AT FIRST HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE BUT AFTER WATCHING IT THERE WERE NO BLINKING LIGHTS. WE VACATION HERE ALOT AND NORMALLY HIGH ALTITUDE FLIGHTS TRAVEL FURTHER EAST ON A NORTH OR SOUTH ROUTE. THIS OBJECT FOR THE FIRST TEN MIN WAS TRAVELING SLOW TO FAST , THEN FAST TO SLOW IN A NORTHERN HEADING. THEN SUDDENLY TURNED TO THE NORTH EAST AND THEN PRECEDED SLOW TO FAST FOR APPROX 2 MINUTES. THEN SLOWLY TURNED A BRIGHT ORANGE AND SLOWLY FADED OFF INTO THE DISTANCE. WE THOUGHT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A METEOR OR POSSIBLY \"SPACE JUNK\". THE REASON I'M CONTACTING YOU IS BECAUSE OF THE ABRUPT MOVEMENTS AND TURNS IT MADE. MY WIFE AND I TALKED ABOUT IT AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION IT WAS NOT A METEOR, SATILLITE OR AIRPLANE, BUT SOMETHING ABNORMAL. IF YOU NEED MORE DETAILS PLEASE CONTACT US AT OUR EMAIL ADDRESS.
