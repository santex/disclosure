{"City":"Bayfield","Object Shape":"Diamond, Star-like","Latitude":"37.229429","divs":["sighting detailswe were camping at the pine creek campsite near bayfield, co, where two of our party (of four) had previously witnessed ufos\\strange lights in the sky. at the moment it appeared we were actually watching the sky for any strange objects - as well as just looking at the stars. i will admit that we were there to search for ufo's, but also that my self-proclaimed role for the night was the skeptic. it's not that i don't believe, but that i wanted to rule out all other possibilities. the craft appeared in the gap between two peaks, which is slightly west of true north. it caught my eye because it was so excessively bright and because a member of our party yelled out to get our attention. my first thought was that it was coming from an entirely different direction that any other object (i'd already determined what appeared to be the flight paths of planes). planes generally traveled from northeast to southwest and visa versa (in line with denver), but this was totally different. initially, it looked like a single, white light ��� an excessively bright light, in fact. it���s hard to explain, but it was really, really bright - way brighter than any other plane or star. however, as it drew closer the white light seemed to separate into three smaller white lights in a perfect line with a red light hovering above it. presumably, this was the top of the craft as it seemed to be descending. the truly interesting thing about this craft was that it was incredibly low ��� perhaps even 500 feet or less above our heads. it flew directly overhead and seemed to bank slightly before disappearing into the south - perhaps over vallecito reservoir. i wasn't quite scared - more awestruck actually, but i did have the presence of mind to attempt to take two photographs, neither of which showed anything distinct. as it passed overhead and banked it became clear that this was a diamond-shaped craft. small lights lined all four sides, delineating the diamond shape and showing the outline of the craft. from our vantage point we could see the underside of the thing which seemed to have four or five red lights (one at each corner and one in the center) and a series of three or four round white lights in the front and four slit-like lights toward the back. it moved slowly and took about thirty seconds to travel across the sky. it made a low, rumbling roar, but did not resemble a plane in any other way. i have no idea how large it was, but it seemed pretty big ��� at least as big as a jet, maybe bigger. also, to be perfectly honest, we were standing next to a creek which was sending out a low, rumbling roar, so i cannot really attest to how loud it was. about an hour and one-half later, another craft appeared from the same general area and traveled the same general path. it seemed exactly the same: appearing as an extraordinarily bright single white light and then showing us the three white lights and single red light as it drew near. as before it was very low. once again there were small, white lights around the perimeter, three or four white lights at the front and three slit-like lights in the back. the only difference was that the five lights at the corners were green and not red. note: this object was not on the same flight path as any of the planes that we had observed in the sky, and, most importantly, it was far, far lower. i did a bit of research and discovered that there are nearby airports that could support a craft of that size. also, for the record, it was not the stealth. i've seen the stealth at close range and it looked nothing like this. there were also lights and orbs and other \"visual anomalies\" in the sky that night and those will be noted in the final question section. attached is a very poorly rendered drawing of what i saw as well as too wretched photographs that show next to nothing. the red and white lights on the actual craft were basically the same size, but my rather deplorable drawing skills (it was an online drawing program), do not reflect that. the large thing at the front was the very bright light."],"Region":"Colorado","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.229429,+-107.589382(29064)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29064) map </A>","Summary":"Diamond-shaped craft over Bayfield, CO","Case Number":"29064","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29064.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29064_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29064_submitter_file2__CampingMay82011_31.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29064_submitter_file3__CampingMay82011_32.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29064.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/12/2011 02:04 UTC","Longitude":"-107.589382","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Bayfield","There were no other sightings in Bayfield on or around May 8th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"05/08/2011 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-05122011-0002"}
