I set it up on a tripod, turned it on, and went back into the house. I set it out in the backyard just to see if I 'caught' anything. I did. Starting at about 1.40 into the clip, what appears to be a sphere seems to just pop in about every 30 seconds. I didn't know they were there, and that's why the clip ends with them still there, otherwise, I would have kept filming until either the film ran out or the spheres went away. Pay particular attention to how the first sphere appears to gradually fade away. It's actually clouds or mist covering the sphere, which is one way I know it's not rain drops on the lens. Any analysis is appreciated."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.753604,+-121.280596(8180)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8180) map </A>","Case Number":"8180","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-121.280596"}
