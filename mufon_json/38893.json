I turned in my vehicle and the light was hidden by trees when I passed the trees it was no longer in the sky. I looked to the right (northern sky) to see if I was okay to turn onto my road and I saw what i'm assuming was the same light, color and size was the same. And it streaked across the sky very fast and had a really long tail behind it and then it vanished. At this point I was in my driveway feeling a little strange, shakey ect. I live on a farm house and when i got out of my vehicle the cows were going nuts, making noises and slamming into the gate. I've lived here for several years and never one time have i seen the cows do that in the day time let alone 11:45 at night. I don't know that it was related but not even 3 minutes after i saw it streak through the sky I heard sirens and saw several emergency response vehicles headed in the direction that the \"UFO\" was traveling."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Indiana","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"38893","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"06/05/2012 05:22 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
