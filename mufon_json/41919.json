In inspecting the pictures I found some anomolies that could be UFOs in three of the pictures. I realize that since I was shooting from inside the window, they could be some kind of reflections from inside the aircraft, but they don't really appear that way to me and I did not notice any reflections at the time of the photographs. One of the photos included was taken at the same time and does not show the possible objects. I would appreciate a second opinion. Thanks."],"Summary":"Taking pictures from aircraft window, later saw images.","Date Submitted":"08/21/2012 05:48 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/10/2012 12:51 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.882448,+-77.065138(41919)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41919) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Virginia"}
