I looked SE into the sky, from where I was standing relative to my house and saw three lights that all seemed to move counter clockwise from my vantage point. With each apparent revolution, it faded further and further away. Took all of five seconds. It was not the first time I have seen strange things up in the air. While I was excited, it did not alter my perception or view of reality. There's life out there."],"Tags":"City","City":"West Hempstead","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.684995,+-73.633716(44655)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44655) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Longitude":"-73.633716"}
