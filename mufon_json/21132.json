Sometime between 1974 and 1978, in the summer time, During night patrol, we were requested by Inkster PD to check an area around Beech Daly and Michigan Ave for a low flying aircraft, several complaints. As we approached the area flying about 700 ft AGL we observed nothing in the area. If the aircraft was flying lower than we were, We would be unable to see it���s running lights against the background of the city lights so I slowed the helicopter and dropped down to just above the tree tops. Suddenly we observed a dark object, shape unknown, no lights, hovering at about 400 ft AGL, in the rough area reported. The object was between us and DTW, and we were in the control zone. I reported the object to metro tower and asked them if they had the object on radar. They stated negative. About that time the object shot up and away, almost instantly to a point about 5000 ft over DTW where it was hovering and was now shiny but we still couldn���t make out a shape. I again asked metro tower if they had him on radar which they replied negative. Right after that, the object disappeared"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Inkster"}
