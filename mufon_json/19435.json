I came outside and in front of us facing north, a column of light with mist in it and within 10sec it was gone like there was nothing there. She said a triangular appeared and began to become extremely bright then suddenly began to emit a light,almost like a flood light straight down with like a mist engulfed in it. By then time I saw it,it was just a tall column of extremely bright light. It looked like a comet tail coming from the ground,but no noise.I've read 4 reports just from tonight around the same time from MA,RI and two from CT describing the same thing.
