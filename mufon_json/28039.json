I walked out to the front porch and as I took the picture and the flash went off, I saw the craft the size of a large plane hovering silently. After the flash, I tried to see the craft and I was unable to see it without the flash. I told myself that I didn't see anything and went back in the house. I had forgotten about the incident until I was printing some of the pictures I had taken, I brighten the picture and found that the picture showed the lights of the outline of the craft.
