I randomly saw it, it did not make any sound or something that made me notice it. I could not determine what it was, so i knew it should be something like an UFO. As the triangle flew by it didn't make any sound, neither did it leave a gas trail, like a plain would do. As I was following the object I could see more people getting on the street to see it for themselves. After it flew behind some buildings I lost sight of it, and I talked a lot with the neighbors about it."],"Longitude":"4.30567","Date of the Event":"05/21/2011 08:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/21/2011 02:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"52.079798"}
