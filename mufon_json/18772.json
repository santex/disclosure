At least 100-150 seen leaving trails in criss-cross patterns and checker board type pattern with 2 hours. We're lucky to see a plane here once an hour unless its coming from Dyess Air Force Base but those are B-1's and C-130's. Definately wasn't those. But anyways I got a video with 3-5 orbs in the video. At one point theres 3 orbs in one frame all near the plane. I've shot about 10 videos of the planes today and this is the only video I see these in."],"Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/20/2009 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There were no other sightings in Abilene on or around August 20th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
