But at the same time it mimicked thestars behind it. I also noticed that they were traveling in a group. I then tookout a 1.5 million candle power spotlight and pointed it at the object it thenstarted to turn and rise higher into the sky where it remained for several hourshovering. Another object also triangular came and parked near it nose to nosealso something traveling at a high rate of speed came from above and seemed tostop on the first triangle. I say this because I dint see it come thru the otherside. I was excited the entire time durring and after. I finally lost sight ofthe object because I fell asleep. It was im sure still in the same spot justbetter hidden by the stars. I spoted 2 but I believe there were more in thearea. Like they were traveling in a group. The rest of the group might bereluctant to talk about it because there was a doctor and 2 nurses with us."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Cheyenne","Summary":"Very large triangles Same color as the night sky","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2419.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2419.html"],"Disposition":"Hoax"}
