It was in Edison Park of the Nortwest side of Chicago, a few miles from O'Hare airport. It was maybe 60 feet off the ground travelling at may 10-12 knots. There was a single light at each tip, and it was silent. My timing was perfect- just as we set foot into the backyard I spotted it jsut entering my line of vision, and watched in amazement as it glided silently away. It was at dusk, with fading light, and if you weren't looking for it you most likely wouldn't have seen it. My friend and I looked at each other and realized the house full of people we just exited would never believe a couple of 15 year olds... As time has passed it seems to be important to be noted. I don't know what it was but I know what is wasn't."],"Date Submitted":"07/12/1967 07:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15059.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15059.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/12/1967 07:45 UTC"}
