We had no knowledge that anything was flying in the area but apparently this is a flight path for jets in and out of the airport in Belgrade -- Yellowstone International Airport. During our two day stay I also heard what sounded like a low flying turbo prop at least twice but could never locate anything in the area other than jets far off in the distance. All of the jets we saw on this trip had clearly visible jet streams. This picture clearly shows no jet stream and I was completely unaware that I had captured this ship until downloading my photos yesterday."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Wilsall","Object Features":"Window(s)","Latitude":"46.129484","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.129484,+-110.358874(41515)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41515) map </A>","Case Number":"41515","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"08/07/2012 11:14 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-08072012-0016","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41515_submitter_file1__080512041.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41515.html"],"Summary":"Camera captured what appears to be similar to a \"cruise ship\" flying object","Object Flight Path":"Unknown"}
