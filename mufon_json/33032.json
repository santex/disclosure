{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/30/2011 09:45 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsas iwas driving home from a friends house i saw what appeared to be searchlights in the sky but they went in random directions; there were three in all,, one went across the sky horizontally back and forth, one appeared and shot straight out then disappeared, then another did the same thing only in a different direction. i had stopped my car and watch; the lights were coming from what looked like a bright star, but it grew even brighter,,,,,,, then turned a reddish color and started moving. it blazed accross the sky and then slowed down andstarted to blink, red\\white and then grew very dim and disappeared. i didnt see itanymore.i have noticed things like this a few timse out here, we're in a very rural area with very little air traffic.. we call them blinkies, and at times have seen up to 27 of them in a 10 minute period or so. sometimes they seem like they have a dim white glow around them,,, other times they just literally appear from nowhere and either blink, or suddenly start moving. they can stop and hover, grow very dim, get very bright, change to a reddish color, and scoot extremely fast accross the sky. they can change directions like a barrel racer, and can get very low to the ground at times. i used to be very scared of them, but ive seen them so often out here now( as well as about 9 other people) that i know im not crazy. i noticed a internet posting about lights seen in lees summit, mo., and thats not very far from here(about 20 minutes drive on the back roads). thats how i found your website."],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.353387,+-90.641238(33032)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33032) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/01/2011 04:56 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-90.641238","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","City":"Cedar Hill","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-11012011-0009","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"starlike object grew brighter then moved rapidly and emitted beams of light","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33032.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33032.html"],"Region":"Missouri","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cedar Hill","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"33032","Latitude":"38.353387"}
