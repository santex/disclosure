{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt about 9:00 PM, I spotted an orange glowing object in my back yard. I grabbed my camera and took these pictures. The object made no sound and seemed to hover for a long time in one place, than it rapidly ascended into the sky. There were a total of four eyewitnesses with me who also observed it. The object appears in the video to be moving around rapidly, that is not the case. I did not have the camera on a tripod and while zoomed in, trying to keep it in the tight shot was difficult."],"City":"Raleigh","Longitude":"-78.630414","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/30/2009 09:06 UTC","Summary":"Orange colored object, with white light in center.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.780926,+-78.630414(16343)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16343) map </A>","Case Number":"16343","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Raleigh","There were no other sightings in Raleigh on or around March 30th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16343.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16343.html"],"Log Number":"US-03312009-0012","Source":"MUFON","Region":"North Carolina","Date of the Event":"03/30/2009 09:06 UTC","Latitude":"35.780926"}
