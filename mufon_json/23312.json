Many of us (50-100) were skating on the local pond in Greenfield Park, New Berlin, Wisconsin. This object came directly over us and stopped. I recall seeing it coming towards us from the south, it had caught my eye, and it seemed like it had found some interest in what we were doing and headed our way. I didn't look like anything I have ever seen before. It was about a 100 yards up and stopped directly over us. Many didn't see it at first, it was completely silent, and people kept skating about, it just sat there as if someone was watching us. Soon everyone was looking up. Some moms were grabbing their kids and went into building screaming, but most of us stopped and got into a stair down contest with it. It was there for about 10 min. It then slowly wet across to the north. Things kind of went back to normal, but after about an hour, it came back from the north, stopped over us again, but only for about a minute. It left going back south, but when it left it took off faster than anything I have ever seen to this date. In a little less than a blink of an eye. The complete details of what it looked liked are vague as it was at night. Its shape was of a narrow blimp or of a fat cigar it had a row of square white lights circling completely around it. I didn't see any wings, tips, or protrusions. When I got home and told my family about the event, my mother called the local news and at that time, they didn't know about it, and did not persue the story to my knowledge. I would like to know if anyone else has reported the same encounter. The picture I drew is what I remember but it traveled on a 45 degree angle."],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar","Latitude":"42.976403","Date Submitted":"05/16/2010 11:09 UTC","Log Number":"US-05162010-0006","Case Number":"23312","Region":"Wisconsin","Summary":"The same object visited us (50-100) twice as we were ice-skating.","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
