Two objects hovering in the sky towards the east vertical to each other. Friend's distance to me was approx 2 miles apart horizontally. The bottom object seemed closer and had a very bright light and the top object had a faint light. Friend then drove approx 10 miles towards the objects which did not move any closer or change their distance to each other. I stayed in a stationary position until the objects disappeared as the sun came over the horizon. Possibly hovering over LA county or farther east."],"City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Case Number":"39736","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-119.415572","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/23/2012 04:50 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.779971,+-119.415572(39736)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39736) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"06/23/2012 10:25 UTC"}
