(Final approach to LAX runs parallel to bastenchurry) I saw 3 lights close together, the first light was stationary, while the other 2 lights next to the first light were streaking straight down...not horizontal like a meteor but straight down. I could not stop the car and watch. So when I got home I checked the news and called my brother-in-law, who is a sheriff, and asked him to check with his station. As of 6:55 he has yet to call me back. I don't think it was a UFO but I thought I just witnessed a mid air colisio't n between to aircraft. I haven't heard anything so maybe it was something else. But it looked very real."],"Summary":"2 lights falling to earth","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/26/2008 06:00 UTC","Case Number":"9282","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Yorba Linda","There was one other sighting in Yorba Linda on or around January 26th 2008"],"City":"Yorba Linda"}
