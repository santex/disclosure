{"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/28/2012 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsAfter a 9-10 year old football game at East Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte, NC, 3 red lights were spotted by my wife and myself as well as a couple behind us and a few people leaving the game. The lights were in a straight line. The right light went out first then the left light followed by the middle. They all stayed stationary and there was no noise detected. There was nothing dripping from them and they never changed color. It was a cloudy night so they were lower than the cloud cover but I can't be sure of how far off the ground they were and I could not make out a single form or multiple forms. I was a little excited while filming then relaxed after the lights went out."],"Latitude":"35.169287","Log Number":"US-05012012-0009","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37866.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37866.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Charlotte","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"North Carolina","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/01/2012 12:48 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.169287,+-80.778364(37866)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37866) map </A>","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Charlotte","There were no other sightings in Charlotte on or around April 28th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.778364","Case Number":"37866","Summary":"3 Red Lights Hovered Over East Meck High School Charlotte, NC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
