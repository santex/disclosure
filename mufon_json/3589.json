Time is pending. (Second photo has the object circled in red to facilitate locating.) The image, 2048 x 1536 pixels taken with his Olympus C-730 Ultra-zoom 3.2 megapixel camera, was sent to me at 72 dpi, along with a batch of photos showing the construction progress. The object does not appear in any other image. When I noticed the object and enlarged it, it appears as a fairly well-defined, top-lighted, bottom-shaded oval suggesting a dimensional flying object and not an artifact of the photography. I have Mr. Fortunato's permission and blessings to submit this photo. I still have to find out the time it was taken. The case form is only partially filled out because this is a photo only and the object was only found afterwards by me and brought to the attention of Mr. Fortunato. My MUFON ID No. is 7600."],"City":"Sedona","Date of the Event":"07/05/2005 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"3589","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"Arizona","Latitude":"34.86974","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-111.76099","Country":"United States"}
