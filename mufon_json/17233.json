(excuse my launguage) i want to move becasue i'm not sure what it was or if it's going to happen again. tonight since i am all about proof i am going to go outside and sit on my deck and see if it happends again, i have a camera and a voice recorder. but this time i'm not going to have my children home and i'm not doing it alone. this has never happend to me before so i'm pretty freaked about it."],"Case Number":"17233","Log Number":"US-05292009-0008","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/28/2009 11:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Gloucester","There were no other sightings in Gloucester on or around May 28th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Massachusetts","Date of the Event":"05/28/2009 11:30 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Gloucester","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-70.652679","Latitude":"42.618828","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17233.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17233.html"],"Summary":"3 green lights that were bright and the shape of a triangle."}
