It was a steady red light with nothing flashing from it and moving so slowly that I ruled out an air plane. It was much too high in the sky to be fireworks from festivities. I thought meteor but do meteors move so slowly??? Anyhow, my wife also witnessed it and we watched for about 3 minutes and it dissappeared either under the thick cloud cover or just vanished."],"Case Number":"34471","Date of the Event":"01/01/2012 12:00 UTC","City":"Guelph","Region":"Ontario","Log Number":"CA-01012012-0027","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Guelph","There were no other sightings in Guelph on or around January 1st 2012"],"Summary":"Red light moving slowly at 12:15 Jan 1 2012","Source":"MUFON"}
