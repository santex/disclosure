I thought it might have been venus, then I noticed it was moving very slowly, and low ( lower than an airplane)and below the cloud deck towards the city. I initally thought it was an airplane, but i have never noticed one so bright, large and moving so slowly. I could never see what the object was completly because it was so bright.. all i could see was the light. I jokingly called my bf and told him I looking at a UFO... and then today I read an article that people in stephenville Texas have been noticing the same thing lately. I thought this could be in connection somehow. I lost sight of the object because i got to work and went inside."],"Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-101.853566","City":"Lubbock","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.586873,+-101.853566(8855)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8855) map </A>","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Lubbock","There were no other sightings in Lubbock on or around January 4th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"8855","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8855.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8855.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/04/2008 08:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.586873","Summary":"Slow moving, large bright looking star","Date of the Event":"01/04/2008 08:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-01142008-0018","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
