My balcony faces south west and overlooks lake ontario and humber bay. It was 530 so the sun was setting when i noticed a bright star like orb just over the water. It hovered and moved very slowly in a north ward direction over mississauga oakville area. The object continued moving north until I could no longer see it from surrounding apartment buildings. Where the object was flying is in major flightpaths for 2 surrounding airports, Pearson International Airport (yyz) and Billy Bishop Toronto Island airport. multiple aircraft flew by the object at various altitudes. This has happened every evening for the last 3 nights now (November 15, 16, 17) at the same time in the same direction, speed, and altitude."]}
