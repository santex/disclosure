Thought it was a star at first, until I noticed it was moving in a southward direction. It was moving faster then a plane, but much slower than a shooting star. Did not change speed or direction. Object moved across the eastern sky from the north and disappeared in the south. It took about 2 to 3 minutes to move across the eastern sky. It was very high up. It looked like other stars in the sky, but this one was moving. It may have been a satellite, due to the how high it was in the sky. I have seen planes fly across the sky many times and it diffently was not a plane. It was something that I have never observed before. It was event I could not stop watching until the object disappeared out of site. This was something I could not explain away, so I decided to send my experience to your website."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
