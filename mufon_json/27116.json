I was just off of route 378 in Bethlehem, Pa. I thought it was a Xmas decoration hovering over someones home to the west of where I was standing. I realized it was not that when it came floating towards me followed by two others. It was orange and redish and in a circular form though it was not a solid circle. They seemed low and close I would say at arms length I would have used a half dollar to cover them from visibility. I then looked to the west and saw another coming towards me but closer. I called into my coworkers who came outside and also observed this. the four objects were not flying or floating. The movement was very calm and peaceful, I cannot describe it. The four objects then seemed to hover for a bout 2-3 minutes and then proceede toward the east and hung there in a distance for 7-8 minutes and then just faded away."],"Case Number":"27116","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date of the Event":"12/24/2010 09:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.630132","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date Submitted":"12/26/2010 12:36 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.630132,+-75.362738(27116)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27116) map </A>","Log Number":"US-12262010-0008","Weather Factors":"None"}
