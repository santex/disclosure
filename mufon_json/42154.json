I happened to look up and saw a quick flash of light (simular to a star at night) above the lower clouds. Stared at the area for approx 1 minute and noticed above the higher cloud 3 very faint dots moving in a wedge formation. They were way to high for birds and to high for most planes. There were no flashing lights that I could see and no sound (if there was sound I may no have heard do to the far off distance). I watched the 3 dots move at what I feel was faster than a standard aircraft from the south east in what appeared to be a gentle arch to the SSE direction. This lasted approx. 15 seconds until the faint object(s) were to far off to distinguish from my vantage point. I am a 14 year Air Force verteran. I am familar with many types of civilian and military aircraft and their flying patterns. This was not lke anything I had see before."],"Latitude":"47.933977","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-08302012-0016","Date Submitted":"08/30/2012 01:34 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.933977,+-97.026265(42154)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42154) map </A>","Region":"North Dakota","Source":"MUFON"}
