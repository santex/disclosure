(this my final assessment from using pencils and a template with various circles, sighting the moon, mt. st. helens (elev. 8600 ft.), 35 miles north, to mt. hood, (elev.11,240 ft), 70 miles east and various buildings i can see downtown five miles nw from my house. this object was under the apparent influence of earth���s gravity. in the first moment low in the trees the object may well have been some 90 miles in altitude which is when the space shuttle begins to turn into a ���fireball���. if you divide 90 miles(h) (and using a 30 deg angle from my eyes by the cosine of 60 degrees (the angle between the line to the object and down to the surface), you get 156 miles from my eyes to the object when it first encountered heavier air. let���s go back to the last sentence of first paragraph where i said that its tail was a ���wisp of trailing white smoke���. i did a little investigating of noctlucent clouds that have been observed before and after sunrise or sunset. they are commonly about 50 miles altitude. assuming the white smoke is similarly receiving the first rays of sunlight, at say 30 degrees altitude and 50 miles in height, so taking 50 and dividing by cos 60 deg, the distance of the object to me is 100 miles when its streaking eastward. then if we project from my eye a ratio of 7\\16th to 24 inches to ���l��� @100 miles, that gives 1.82 miles- the length of the object. my background is that of a land surveyor and associate engineer with my father who���s practice was in eugene for many years. i���m retired now. my hobbies include mountaineering, backpacking, astronomy, weather, classical music, and ufo���s ���back to 1947. i���ve obviously had plenty to think about this the past twenty-four years."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.290949,+-121.549212(7617)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7617) map </A>","Longitude":"-121.549212","Region":"Oregon","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"7617","Source":"MUFON"}
