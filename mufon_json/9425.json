{"Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder, Disc","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["sighting detailsfirst, i was between 7-9 years old. my father took me on a 'cat fishing' weekend on the platte river - or one of the many run-offs from the platte. it was 1969-1971 summer. my best guess as is my father was that it happened in july-aug of 1970 after nightfall - probably in the early hours. (ie, between 11pm - 2am) it was pitch-black, no clouds, no city lights, and only stars! i remember that very well... we were probably an hour away from the any large city (lincoln, omaha). i became tired of fishing - dad, myself, and a friend of his were fishing from dad's friend's \"john\" boat - in the middle of the platte, just floating along slowly with the current. i laid down in the john boat and gazed at the sky. i was laying there for no more than a few minutes when i noticed a silver-grey tube in the sky. kind of cigar shaped. it was traveling east-west or vice versa (but was following the platte river). as i focused on it, i immediately noticed that there was a saucer\\disk\\circle (of different color) on one side of it, like it was escourting it. on the other side and slightly behind it was another disk\\saucer\\circle that was bright orange. it stayed slightly behind it but seemed to be a rear escourt (i'm using analogy for ease). as the object passed overhead, there was no noise, no wind, no anything... i thought it was bugs\\birds\\planes (the ne air national guard was using rf-4 phantoms at that time and they used to buzz the platte reg. - a very cool offering for kids at that time!) as i said, i dismissed it as an illusion, bugs, planes, etc...until i saw it again! it had passed over once and then, as if in orbit or trajectory, passed over us again in the same configuration. that was several minutes later! this time i notified my dad and his friend who both saw it. my dad immediately pulled me to him and i could tell he was a little concerned. i did not feel worried or any fear. actually, i wanted them to land so i could see them. my dad's friend tried to tell us that it was either an old gemini capsule reentering the atmosphere or maybe a spent stage 1 from one of the apollo shots. i remember thinking\\knowing that was crap since they would have made a sound or crashed! (they were far to big\\close not to) i cannot nor would i suggest any size of what i saw or how fast they were traveling. but, i would guess that what i saw was at least 200 feet from the ground (probably further then that!) but i'm just guessing because the tallest trees we have around that area can be upwards of 150 feet. and i saw the ufo(s) pass to the horizon. -the best analogy i can give for what i saw that evening\\morning was a silver hotdog (very shiny) with a colored disk on one side almost touching it (about midway down the hotdog) and a bright orange disk on the other side but near the 'rear' end of the hotdog and just a little bit further back. in other words the orange one wasn't as close as the first disk. i do not remember the color of the first disk but blue keeps coming to mind (note: it was many years ago and i'm sure that my memory would not be correct so i will not guess i just remember it was not orange or silver!) so in closing here is the way it unfolded: -cloudless summer night. -i was laying in a boat watching the stars. -i saw a silver cylinder with two different colored disks pass over head. -some time later i noticed that it passed over again. (same direction same orientation\\configuration) -i notified my dad who seemed concerned. -friend thought it was an old gemini\\apollo\\ or military aircraft. -never saw it again. -years later, i ran into a person who described a similar event around the same area! (of which i dismissed his story because he already knew about mine)"],"Log Number":"US-02032008-0007","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.268514,+-95.962751(9425)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9425) map </A>","City":"Omaha","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"9425","Latitude":"41.268514","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-95.962751","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9425.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9425.html"],"trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Omaha","There were no other sightings in Omaha on or around July 1st 1970","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/01/1970 01:00 UTC","Region":"Nebraska","Summary":"cigar shape w/ 2 disks accompanying","Date of the Event":"07/01/1970 01:00 UTC"}
