I thought they wer small planes but they didnt have the lights u usually see and they moved weird!! I seen stuff like this before up home in auckland once but never after I moved to lower hutt 16 years ago!! my kids thought they were birds but they were far up in the clouds and I dont think birds can go that high! I googled ufo sitings and this website came up so im posting it here, it's on facebook too! the airport isnt that far from us so we see planes taking off most of the time but these had no sound and to go up into the clouds after a while!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-41.291191,+174.897827(49617)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49617) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON"}
