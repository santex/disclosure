I looked straight up and saw this bean very high in the sky with white lights that came on and off in no specific sequence. At first, I thought it must have been a glare from my sun glasses but when I removed them the object was still there. I then got up to look at the object from a different perspective and it remained at the same hovering spot. Because it was at a great height, I could not guess as to the length but I would say it was as long as a 737 airplane. The beam was not cigar shaped, rather more rectangular. I eventually when back to my reading and when I glanced up, it was gone."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-94.631458","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"38.897104","Date of the Event":"08/19/2011 03:30 UTC","City":"Leawood","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"08/22/2011 09:44 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON"}
