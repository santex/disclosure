We both watched come from the south, then come over our heads then head north. Slowed down a little then sped up a little bit. No blinking lights at all. The light stayed the same even after it went well to the north. You could see the light for miles from both directions. Was weird no blinking, no different colored lights. Did not change directions though. It did change speeds but continued to fly straight. There was no noise at all from the object."],"Date of the Event":"04/09/2013 08:40 UTC","Log Number":"US-04092013-0016","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 29 other sightings in Levittown","There were no other sightings in Levittown on or around April 9th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:08:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.128871,+-74.862219(46698)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46698) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Levittown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Diamond, Oval, Star-like","Latitude":"40.128871"}
