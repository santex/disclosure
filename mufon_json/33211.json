There was a total of 12 of us that went over to their house. We all had high expectations because almost all of the attendants had multiple previous sightings. Funny enough,one of the organizers, had never had a sighting before that night. We had telescopes, night vision, cameras and Google Sky Map ready for the evenings event. We setup in a field adjacent to the home around 7:30 pm. We watched a lot of commercial traffic go by like 747 and at least 1 helicopter. We also saw at least half a dozen satellites go by. They are usually the tiny white specs that move across the sky in a straight line. Around 9:30 pm, out of the blue, some says ���Look There���! At about 90 degrees from our position heading east we saw what appeared to be a boomerang shaped object. I would estimate it to be about 1 to 1.5 miles or 5,400 feet in the sky. The size was about the same diameter of the moon. This seem extremely large in comparison to many of the commercial airplanes we had seen earlier. We agreed it seemed to be about 3 to 4 times the size of a 747. It had two orange lights, one on each end and a large center red light. We all noticed that it did not have the required red and green lights. We also notice that none of the lights were flashing. The red light seem very large. At that distance it looked like the diameter of the red light had to be about the same size of a small car. Because we where all stunned we were silent and heard absolutely no noise. This was very different from all the other air traffic we had seen that evening. Even the commercial airplanes that were much higher in the sky could be hear. Below is an illustration of what we saw. The photo is a 30 second exposure of the exact location where we saw the object. I was using a Nikon D50 with a Quantaray LD 70-300 telephoto lens."],"Date of the Event":"11/05/2011 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33211.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33211_submitter_file1__IllustrationofSighting.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33211.html"],"Summary":"UFO sighting after MUFON NC meeting during Sky Watch","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","City":"Hickory"}
