I didn't have any flashing lights like a plane or jet have and it did not make a sound when it went over. I saw 4 of them Monday night on 9-23. One and then about half and hour later another moving from south to north. Then two more moving from north to south. Aren't jets suppose to have flashing lights on its underside and wingtips? Well, these didn't have any flashing lights or sound like most jets have when they fly over. This happened between 9 and 10 at night. I'm just trying to figure out what the objects where that I saw. I don't think they were jets unless they where drones, but these where at a real high altitude. I would say as high or higher than jets fly. I had a pair of binoculars to try to zoom in on them but I couldn't get close enough to see what they were. I need to get a high powered telescope or binoculars. Did I actually see a UFO or was it something else? Curiousity is killing me!"]}
