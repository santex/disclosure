Headed north on Route 3, when I passed Exit 17 in Braintree. I looked just above the tree line and noticed airplane traffic going to Logan airport. I noticed the first plane in the distance, to its left from my perspective I noticed another commercial airline headed in same direction. When my sight dropped down from that plane I noticed closer to me just above the tree line. Not sure of exact height maybe 500 feet off the ground. About 2-3 miles distance from me. I saw an oval about the size of my thumbnail at arm���s length. As soon as I noticed it began to vanish. What I mean is, it became translucent and gradually over 30 seconds or less, it dissipated. It never moved or changed in shape as it went from translucent to completely gone. It dissipated like smoke would. I knew it wasn���t smoke however due to its shape and location staying the same. It���s very hard to describe. I didn���t report it sooner due to it took me some time to really think about what I had seen. I don���t know what it was. I have never, ever seen anything like this before. Note: I have researched UFO's all my life. Still don���t know if they are real or not. I am somewhat skeptical in nature. Although, I am open to the possibility."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Braintree","There were no other sightings in Braintree on or around November 18th 2009"]}
