After watching for a few min.,we also saw color changes in the lights. At that point, my husband pulled off to the highway shoulder, so he could also get a good look. We all watched the bizzare lights for a moment, and then decided to get off the highway for a better (safer) look. Watched the strange lights for about 15min, and decided to drive to the home on lake that we were staying. Through the town of Holland we saw nothing to the west (city lights), but once on the lake, saw the same lights in the same sky area. I seemed to us that the lights stayed in the same spot over Lake Michigan, just randomly changing shape and color. ALL 4 of us saw this strange event. My husband watched the event until about 12:00 am. Not sure what we witnessed, but it was a first for all of us."]}
