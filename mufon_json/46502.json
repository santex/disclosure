There was a police helipcopter flying around in the area at the same time shining it's searchlight down onto the streets below but it did not seem to notice the bright lights off in the distance or at least it did not react to them at all."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46502.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46502.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.758106,+-117.145836(46502)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46502) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.145836","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"46502","City":"San Diego","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/31/2013 02:27 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Other","Date of the Event":"03/30/2013 11:09 UTC"}
