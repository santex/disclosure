I initially noticed a falling object that appeared to be on fire. I alerted my wife as I thought it was atypical of a shooting star or anything else we have witnessed. The object appeared to be falling when it split into 3 seperate pieces. All three pieces maintain the identical distance and desending speeds. The three parts then broke apart and several of the pieces hovered on the horizon. All of the objects appeared to be in a formation with identical spacing. Then as they hovered they appeared to dim on and off for several minutes. I have seen several reentry events and this was by far the most bizarre. We lost sight of the objects when we exited I-675 on exit 2. The entire event lasted about 10 minutes. I have not been able to ID this event but I am sure it was not a plane, or flares, or any previously orbiting body."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/27/2010 06:52 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"24795"}
