The sky had big cloud patches. Behind one of those patches I saw a very bright light approaching in a horizontal manner. Where i live it is usual to see police helicopters. What draw my attention was the speed it had and that it didn't make any sound. Absentmindedly I thought the sound might come later (as if it was a supersonic jet!) and I kept looking and waiting for it. But the bright object approached a clearing and then took off as a rocket, leaving a tail of flares after it, also without a sound. It looked like a shooting star, but in contrary direction. I kept looking for the object, but it was gone. I was not scared in any moment, since first I thought it was a helicopter. It was first after the event was over that I came to realize that I had seen a flying object that moved in a way that I have neither seen or heard of before."],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"04/08/2010 11:30 UTC","City":"Miami","Longitude":"-80.223909","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22722.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22722.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"Horizontal bright object took off as a rocket.","Log Number":"US-04082010-0023","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.797739,+-80.223909(22722)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22722) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"25.797739","Case Number":"22722","Date of the Event":"04/04/2010 02:00 UTC","Disposition":"IFO"}
