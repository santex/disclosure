{"City":"Fontana","Case Number":"48576","divs":["Sighting DetailsA friend and I were in my driveway talking and stargazing when I saw a very bright white light pulse twice about 1 second apart very high up in the sky, I immediately knew it was not a comet or plane or anything else familiar. I told my friend about it then we both looked in the direction of the sighting and we both saw that it pulsated again after about 15 seconds a few degrees north from the first sighting. I was surprised but I was not shocked as I am very well informed on the subject of extra-terrestrials and this is not my first sighting. It did not reappear after that sighting and there was nothing near that could've blocked the view of it, later that night, about an hour later we also saw a much smaller and much less intense blue star-like object moving very fast very high up in the sky heading south-west then disappear. Also I should note that a while later a friend on Facebook posted a status stating that he saw the same pulses of light at the same time and area"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.109592,+-117.45703(48576)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48576) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Three bright pulses of light high up behind or in a cloud","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"07/03/2013 08:28 UTC","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Fontana","There were no other sightings in Fontana on or around July 2nd 2013"],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Longitude":"-117.45703","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48576.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48576.html"],"Log Number":"US-07032013-0006","Date of the Event":"07/02/2013 11:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.109592"}
