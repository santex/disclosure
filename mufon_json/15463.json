THANK YOU! On the 11th, my husband called me from Sandy Springs Ga. and said he had been watching a bright starlike object in the sky. He said it was just hovering. I thought he was crazy! Well, the next night, the 12th, He called me outside our home in Atlanta Ga. and he showed me a bright light in the sky. He claims its the same object as the night before. I could not believe it. It was much larger than a star and much brighter. I went inside and got my camera and started taking pictures of it. As I was watching the object, it was as if someone turned the light off. It disappeared! I stood outside and watched and waited and about 15 minutes later the light was back. I started taking more pictures, as I noticed it was moving downward. I continued until it went out if sight."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.755135","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Summary":"A very bright light hovering in the sky.","City":"Atlanta","Longitude":"-84.385622","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Georgia","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.755135,+-84.385622(15463)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15463) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15463.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15463_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15463.html"],"Case Number":"15463","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply"}
