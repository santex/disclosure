It was somewhere around 7:45-8pm not exactly sure. We were coming down Las Brisas towards McCarren and looked to the right towards the mountains and saw a strobbing light. The object was very high. Im pretty sure it was not an airplane as we see them all the time. The rythm seemed much different than an airplane.The object was definately not a star nor a satilite. I was not able to see if the object moved suddenly or not. We never stopped to observe. My wife is affraid of actually seeing a ufo. Freaks her out and she was driving and would not stop to observe. Now I wish she had. When we returned from the store the object was no longer visible."],"Summary":"Something over Reno last night.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Reno","There were no other sightings in Reno on or around"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14849.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14849.html"],"Longitude":"-119.805033"}
