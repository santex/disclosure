The image is inverted because the telescope does not have an image erecting lense. I took a couple of images that were clear then the green spheres appeared for a few minutes then faded in less than a second and took some more pictures. See the attached image. I don't think they were craft because they didn't move and not moisture on the lense because when the telescope vibrated the spheres did not move relative to the moon. Any idea what they might be? I can send images taken shortly before and after for comparison if you are interested. Regards, Mark S."]}
