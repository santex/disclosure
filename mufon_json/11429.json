what i think may be a ufo was in scotland in a pasture where the tour bus had stopped when i was on a high school trip, which is coincidentally the same week of the same year that my wife had gone on a trip visiting england and scotland during high school. we may well have met during our two separately organized trips, something we learned after we were married when looking through old photos. i still remember the ufo sighting vividly and may have caught the craft on film, since i distinctly recall taking photos of the environment, hearing the sonic boom, falling back on my butt and seeing the craft in the sky for brief instant. i'm pretty sure it was a chevron\\triangle shape. the craft couldn't have been more than 200 feet above ground during daylight and was just hovering for a few seconds. i know some others in my school saw it and we talked about it during the bus ride to the next city. this happened at the age of 17, and i didn't \"meet\" my wife until i was 28. the second time was while i was living in japan at the age of 24 while living and working as an english teacher on a tiny island in the seto inland sea called mukaishima, across from onomichi, a famous city in hiroshima prefecture which was once one of the most important centers of trade in all of japan. onomichi has a population of about 100,000, and mukaishima i recall was around 19,000. the event took place at fireworks festival in the channel that ran between mukaishima and onomichi. i was seated on the western coast along the channel of mukaishima with five other friends, three japanese and two americans, sarah from boston and jacqueline from new york city, who also lived on mukaishima. during the fireworks display, we all noticed a chevron\\triangle shaped craft appear from behind the mountains on the north side of the island, hover and then disappear into the mountains and then the sky. we all looked at each other and confirmed what we had seen. it was unmistakeably unusual because there are no airports or landing sites in mukaishima and the winds around the bridge from onomichi to mukaishima on the north side of the island are too strong for someone to even consider flying there. the third time was when i was 34 and living in orange county, new york, where i now reside with my wife - the same woman i may have met while i was in scotland in high school - and two kids. my wife sleeps upstairs with the kids, and i sleep downstairs since i wake early to travel to new york city for work. we were both awakened at an early hour around 3am to a very loud ongoing noise near the house that for some reason did not awaken either of the kids. we were drawn to the very large window on our second floor landing that overlooks the front lawn. there right in front of our eyes was unmistakeably a ufo. it was the closely either of us had ever been to a craft unlike anything we've seen. i've seen a lot of crafts and was fascinated by ones that were built by humans at an early age. there was a blue light eminating from the craft and visibly shining into our window. it must have hovered for what seemed like two or three minutes. we were both in a state of shock and just froze. i recall saying to my wife to go check on the kids and make sure they're alright because i just sensed fear. the only emotion i can recall was fear. what appeared to be two creatures unlike anything i had ever seen maneuvering this craft no more than twenty feet from us outside our window scared the living daylights out of me. i'm pretty sure we left the scene long before they took off. i was really afraid. there have been numerous instances in the past four years since i was 34 where my wife and i distinctly recall seeing unusual things, whether the sightings are ufo's or not who knows. the most recent was last month at the age of 38, where i was home alone. my wife was still at work. the kids were at school. i am a consultant and was working from home that day. i was sitting in my office near the front of the house doing some work at my laptop, which is right next to a desktop computer that was switched off at the time. all of a sudden the speakers to my computer started emitting a signal that sounded oddly comprehensible at times but at times like a foreign language. i can speak japanese and at one time knew hebrew and spanish. my wife can speak 4 or 5 languages, as well. i even learned a bit of swahili in college. i never heard any language like this. there were clearly patterns in the signal of a language. but regardless the amazing thing is that my computer which is off is emitting signals. this is simply not possible. i work in the field of technology and have been around a lot of emerging technologies. then my television in the living room, also off at the time, and a stereo system which wasn't even plugged in, all turned on and started to display random programs. nearly every electronic device within 20-30 feet of me was on, not by my own doing. as i walked around my house, the electronics in whatever room i went in turned on. i don't smoke, do drugs or drink. i may have a glass of wine once or twice a year. it was about 2-3pm in the afternoon. after noticing all of this, i had the urge to go outside and see what the heck is going on. i immediately thought maybe it's a military craft from west point or some other military installation hovering close to my house for some unknown reason causing all the electronics to go haywire but i was startled to find a chevron\\triangle craft just above the house maybe 80 to 100 feet in the air just above the treeline. again fear. i ran back inside and went for the videocam in the closet but by the time i went back outside the craft was gone. i do not want fame. i do not want people on my property taking photos. i just don't want to be abducted or whatever. you know i just want my family to be safe. whether it's the military or aliens, somebody is really interested in me, my family or my house. my house used to be a farm property and i was told there used to be a barn where my house now sits. the property is full of slate just a foot or two below the ground surface. the visits from such crafts have become so much more frequent that i'm really scared, to be honest. my wife and i picked up the kids from pre-k the other day and on the way home listened to 99.1 fm where they had a program on mufon. we talked about it, and several days went by. i am now writing just as much to get this off my chest as i am to seek guidance. i've never revealed this to anyone but my wife. i am a senior executive in information technology and can't explain any of this logically though i consider myself highly intelligent and logical. i want to remain anonymous but i feel i need some expert advice to the extent that i don't want to get abducted and fear that the frequency of sightings may lead to some kind of undesirable event, but i don't want to draw attention to me or my family. i would privately welcome input from those more experienced in this. lately i've been having a lot of bizarre dreams, too. i don't know what it all means. my wife commented just the other day that \"they\" seem to be very interested in us. we are both very educated with masters degrees and of sound mind and body. if it's just the military, great. maybe i'll sleep a lot easier. i even called the police to see if they were searching for someone or if there were any planned military exercises in the area that i should know about. not that they would tell me anyway, but of course they said \"no.\" the last thing i want to say is that i am looking for a new job and just realized yesterday when my wife asked me where some of the leading jobs are located that two of the three leading ones are within 2-3 hours of roswell, nm. i've never been to that part of the country. i have no reason to want to live or work there. i have no family there. call it chance or coincidence. just the same, it is a bit unsettling to think subconsciously i might be drawn to that area. possibly for a reason."],"Latitude":"41.336761","Date Submitted":"05/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"New York","Object
