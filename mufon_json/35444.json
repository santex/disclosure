I first noticed the object because since childhood I have observed many objects in sky, including planets and stars. I hunted for the galaxy Andromeda at one time. Whenn I thought I saw a very interesting star formation I kept looking at it, noticing the very regular 5 star pattern that was made. Then I realized it was impossible to see the stars, as the sky was obscured by clouds. I stopped looking at the object because I had other things to do and this funny craft was not moving or doing anything.."],"Object Shape":"Diamond","Summary":"five stars in a pentagle, I thought were stars but then observed heavy clouds so object was below clouds and structure was very regular","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35444.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35444.html"],"Longitude":"-87.623988","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Illinois","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There was one other sighting in Chicago on or around November 15th 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
