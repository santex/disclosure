This happened in the blink of an eye the only thing I have in favor of my credibility is that we both saw it, and in all honesty what I have against my credibility is that I have witnessed unexplained activity in the sky multiple times. I am starting to teeter on hoping for a logical explanation and the far more delusional thought that some entity is watching me in the sky."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.95","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Georgia","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.95,+-83.383333(43315)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43315) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"08/15/2012 12:00 UTC","City":"Athens","Case Number":"43315","Longitude":"-83.383333","Date Submitted":"10/17/2012 01:09 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"00:00:00","Summary":"Riding motorcycles with roomate.
