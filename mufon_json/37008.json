While outside my in-laws smoking in Depford NJ. I saw what I thought was a black balloon. It was traveling west from the Jersey coast, against the wind. It then started to travel northwest. When it stopped I would say it was approx. at the Ben Franklin bridge on the Jersey side. The object was between layers of clouds. The upper layer was blowing west, while the lower layer was blowing nne. this object stayed in the same spot for 45 min. It then moved slowly sse back toward the Jersey coast another 15 min. until I finally lost sight of it behind the houses. Did anyone ever see anything like this before? My wife and kids saw this and blew it off. This has been on my mind and I can't stop thinking about it. The family I told all broke my stones. I want to find out more about this. Can anyone help me figure this out?"],"Region":"New Jersey"}
