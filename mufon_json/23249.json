My first reaction was a cell phone tower but there isn't any in that particular direction nor anywhere in close proximity to my house. I started watching these objects 2 hours ago and they haven't moved since the second red orb appeared below it. What was so interesting to me was the fact that it is snowing very hard and the visibility is very low. Now how in the world would I be able to make out two giant red orbs in the sky miles away from my house?? Beats me."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Fort Collins","Object Shape":"Circle","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.58808,+-105.082113(23249)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23249) map </A>","Latitude":"40.58808","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23249.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23249.html"],"Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"23249","Date Submitted":"05/12/2010 02:10 UTC","Log Number":"US-05122010-0002","Date of the Event":"05/11/2010 11:00 UTC"}
