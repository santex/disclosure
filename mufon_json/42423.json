I was driving south from Brownsburg towards Clermont on CR 300. The lights were observed above Raceway Park. There was a race that had just ended. I think there may have been fireworks that just ended, however they had stopped before my observation (I can hear them from my house....heard them going off before I left). I have never seen anything like this before, during, or after any fireworks displays I have seen. There were maybe 8 red-orange orb-shaped lights scattered in the sky hovering. They slowly began to move and line up. Then hovered and began to move and scatter again. They slowly faded one by one almost as if they were burning away. Thought maybe it was left over embers from the fireworks, but doesn't make sense that they would linger in the air so long or move like that. I did observe lights from a plane nearby...we see many planes in this area. The objects seemed more distant. Observed similar objects hovering in the same area but from further away....at the Ronald Reagan connection road and US 136 on August 30, 2012 also at approximately 9:30. I am really hoping there is some logical explanation I am just not aware of. Since this happened during a race event, I am sure others saw it. Perhaps they knew of what it could be. I just found it very strange."],"Summary":"Orange glowing balls of light that were scattered then lined up, hovered, started to scatter and just fade away one by one","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Clermont","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.809766","Date Submitted":"09/09/2012 11:28 UTC","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"09/08/2012 09:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Region":"Indiana","Case Number":"42423","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Clermont","There were no other sightings in Clermont on or around September 8th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09092012-0025","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.809766,+-86.322492(42423)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42423) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42423.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42423.html"]}
