I spent a lot of time this summer up in the mountains camping,taking pictures and videos in the mountains and at home. There have been on numerous occasions that I have experienced things that I can't explain, or for that matter don't understand why I able to see the things that I have seen. But I can tell you that I have communicated with something that looked human to me but was accompanied by five other grays. The human looking girl acknowledged to me that she was with the grays as she was holding hands with one of the grays.It was not a threatening experience that I had, I would have to say they were friendly and did not try to harm me in any way. I have got many more amazing pictures and videos that I will show you And go into further detail about when you contact me."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.916501,+-77.032444(51259)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51259) map </A>","Longitude":"-77.032444","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Window(s), Insignia, Other, Unknown","City":"Washington","Region":"Washington","Tags":"City"}
