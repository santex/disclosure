I thought it was a pulsar but it was brighter than the other stars in the sky. I then noticed that it was moving side to side. I called my husband upstairs to take a look at it because I thought maybe my eyes were deceiving me. He looked at it and agreed it was moving side to side and up and down as well as stopping to hover now and then. We stood there watching it in shock and awe for about five minutes and then it just disappeared. No trail, no nothing. Just Poof!
