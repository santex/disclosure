{"Object Shape":"Disc","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsthis sighting happened in mid september 1974. i was 22 at the time. i lived with my mother on wilmington island outside savannah, ga. my brother, a friend and i were driving into savannah in his small chevrolet truck to see a friend. it was dusk and just starting to get dark. my brother turned on his headlights and they came on but immediately started to dim. we were on a bridge over the intracoastal waterway leading into thunderbolt. when we were over the bridge he pulled off onto a road by the river leading to a marina and we stopped to try and find out what was wrong. three friends of ours in a van saw the truck from the bridge and came over to see what we were doing. one of them worked at a gas station and had a little mechanical training. i got out from under the hood as it was now getting crowded and leaned against the side of the truck looking out over the marsh. i saw bright lights in the sky and was trying to determine what it was when one of our friends from the van looked out over the marsh and said, \"that's a f*cking flying saucer!\". i was coming to the same conclusion but wanted to be sure before i told anyone else. it was a metallic disk fairly large or much closer than i though, i guessed it was 60-80 feet in diameter. it had a round bottom and top with a small dome in the middle of the top. there was a short mast on top of the dome. there were bright white lights rotating around the rim of the disk and a steady blue light on top of the mast. though it was getting dark when we first saw it it appeared to have a dull metallic finish. it looked just like a cartoon flying saucer. i thought it was about 1\\2 a mile away and about 1500-2000 feet in the air. it was north of us moving slowly west. there was no sound from it. we watched it for a couple of minutes until we lost sight of it behind trees on the bluff at the edge of the marsh. the friend with mechanical training had traced the problem to a known bad voltage regulator and managed to unstick it so we could use the headlights. we closed the hood and were standing near the truck talking when the ufo came back into view from behind the trees. it was lower now and closer. we watched it and soon realized it was headed straight for us and still getting lower. when it was probably 200-300 yards away and now down to about 500 feet i started worrying that maybe we were in danger. i didn't know it at the time the but several of the others were also starting to get worried. the ufo stopped moving and hovered for about 10-15 seconds (at least it seemed) then it slowly started moving towards the northeast and began gaining altitude. after it reached approximately the altitude we had first seen it at it picked up a little more speed and continued on a northeast course more or less following the path of the wilmington river. even at the fastest we saw it move it was probably going only 25-50 mph. a few minutes after it left a car with six excited teenagers in it pulled up along side. they said they had been following a flying saucer they saw at isle of hope and wanted to know if we had seen it. we were getting in our respective vehicles and had been there for 20-30 minutes so we told them we hadn't seen it. you could actually still see it's lights to the northeast if you knew where to look. there was no mention of anyone else seeing it in the newspaper or on the television news. it had to have been visible to other people crossing the bridge over the river. we didn't report it either. this sighting happened about four miles from hunter army airfield which was not active at the time. i don't know whether they even used the radar during the time it was in caretaker status. the illustration is crude but the shape and the lights are as accurate as i could make them. the drawing was done in about 1993 using ms paint. i took a picture of the monitor since all i had was a dot matrix printer. i lost the file to a hard drive failure so this is a scan of the monitor photo done a couple of years later."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3822.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/3822_submitter_file1__tboltufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3822.html"],"Log Number":"US-09072005-0002","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"Thunderbolt","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.033544,+-81.049834(3822)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3822) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Thunderbolt","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/15/1974 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Metallic disk at dusk","Case Number":"3822","Region":"Georgia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/15/1974 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Dome","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-81.049834","Latitude":"32.033544"}
