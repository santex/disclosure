{"Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailswhile looking for a house in Cape Coral, Fl I noticed an object that I thought was a blimp in the street view. It bothered me and after a while I looked at it more closely and found that if I moved one frame in google earth the object was shown moving along the roadside power lines and traveled from horizon to horizon in 4 frames which covered not more than 200 feet in front of the house I was looking at. One frame was close enough to see circular spots clearly on the object that could be like holes or lights or something - to me it almost looked like a giant whiffle ball but not really. the detail is very good."],"Summary":"on google earth - excellent visual of a 20' sphere going in opposite direction of google veichle at high speed following power lines daytime","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-06202013-0021","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Latitude":"26.569334","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-81.943033","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Cape Coral","There were no other sightings in Cape Coral on or around June 20th 2013"],"City":"Cape Coral","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48286.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48286.html"],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/20/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"48286","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.569334,+-81.943033(48286)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48286) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/20/2013 07:55 UTC"}
