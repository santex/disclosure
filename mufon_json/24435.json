We were driving west on County Line Rd in Spring Hill, FL when I noticed several strange lights in the sky. I asked my wife what she thought it was and she had no idea. My wife stopped the car and she, my daughter, and I all got out of the car and watched. We saw about 8 - 10 orange lights flying in a row. I hesitate to say a row as it was not a straight line. Some of them were grouped closer together than others. We watched as they continued over the trees into clear view. I noticed 3 of them formed into a triangle for a minute or so. As they seemed to reach the same area in the sky, the lights went from orange to red and one by one they seemed to vanish from view. Both my wife and I searched for any sign of navigational lights but could see none on any of them. We noticed no sounds of engines either. Unfortunately we were not able to catch any video or photos of the event as we had no cameras with us."],"City":"Spring Hill","Log Number":"US-07112010-0014","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24435","Date Submitted":"07/11/2010 01:11 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"At least 8 orange lights in the sky.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"28.484388","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24435.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24435.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
