The sun was going down and it was a pleasant temperature. Asked a police officer what they were and he said they were satellites. Airplanes were flying behind it in the distance. Can satellites hang that close? Could they be local satellites? He said he didn't know. I have never seen them before and I have returned home and they are still there. Unfortunately my camera isn't picking them up. These are not stars. If they were, I would be able to see more in the sky. The whole sky was devoid of stars. The day and evening have been sunny, clear and 50 degrees. I watched them for about 20 minutes to see if they would move, but they didnt. I am still seeing them but only out of a corner window. Other homes are blocking my view of both."],"City":"Orland Park","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Orland Park","There were no other sightings in Orland Park on or around November 19th 2008"],"Latitude":"41.63501","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.63501,+-87.847402(13823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13823) map </A>"}
