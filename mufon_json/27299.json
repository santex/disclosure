{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIn July of 2007, I was with my co worker Justin cleaning up the grounds at the Mercer Island Beach Club. We were outside and I happened to look towards Boeing Field in the east. There was a strange light that seemed to be hovering over Boeing Field. It was a Star-like shape. I thought it seemed odd and pointed it out to my friend Justin. He agreed with me. Then, about 15 minutes later, I saw the light, but it was getting smaller and smaller. About a half hour later, I pointed towards the light, and told Justin to come take a look at this. The light, that was once the size of a star, was now extremely small. Justin and I watched it until it dimmed out. The light just disappeared from sight. Justin and I looked at each other dumbfounded. We were speechless the rest of the night."],"Country":"United States","City":"Mercer Island","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/08/2011 02:05 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27299.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27299.html"],"Case Number":"27299","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-01082011-0003","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Washington","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Mercer Island","There were no other sightings in Mercer Island on or around July 21st 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"47.578065","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.578065,+-122.213567(27299)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27299) map </A>","Summary":"Strange Star-Like Craft Hovering Over Boeing Field In Redmond, WA","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-122.213567","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Date of the Event":"07/21/2007 09:27 UTC"}
