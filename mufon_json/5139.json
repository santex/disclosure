For the past 3 months, I have seen many different types of crafts that are clearly not Earth made. I mostly see a Triangle shaped UFO about the size of a football field. This UFO has 3 white lights on the bottom three corners. I have also seen a Disc shaped UFO, with a bubble on the bottom of the ship. This ship had several lights on the bottom , white, amber, green, red. As the ship headed north east, it started to climb and I clearly saw what looked like windows! If someone wants to call me I will be more than willing to explain each of these occurances in full, as well as others, but I do not have enough time to explain all of them. I am a Mufon member."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Case Number":"5139","Log Number":"US-07242006-0004","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Dalton","There were no other sightings in Dalton on or around June 23rd 2006"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"42.473696","Date of the Event":"06/23/2006 11:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Diamond, Disc, Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5139.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5139.html"],"City":"Dalton","Region":"Massachusetts","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.473696,+-73.166214(5139)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5139) map </A>"}
