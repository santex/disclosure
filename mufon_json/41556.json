I quickly took a picture of it and ran to get my camcorder. We watched the object for 5-6 minutes as it ascended westward until it just vanished. I also looked at the object through my binoculars. It was aqua colored,(perhaps because it was reflecting the sky which was aqua colored that eve?), it was glowing..no change in brilliance... no pulsating..., it had a darker center area. It didn't appear to be perfectly spherical but more diamond-ish in shape. I have the film and the still photo."],"trends":[],"Region":"Pennsylvania","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.211912,+-77.189425(41556)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41556) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/06/2012 08:57 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/08/2012 05:14 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
