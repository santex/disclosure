It was very large. There were 2 sets of lights. The first set on the top of the disc was vertical lines with spaces in between and they made a full oval and were spinning counter clock wise. Underneath those lights were little dots, that seemed like they were turning off and on. At first I thought it was reflections, but we pulled over on the side of the road and it was still moving. Once we got a distance away I could see the full shape.Im not a big believer in Aliens and Ufo's but this made me believe. I wish I wasn't so freaked out or we would have taken a picture."],"Region":"Massachusetts","Log Number":"GB-11142009-0007","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/13/2009 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Vertical lights circling with small blinking lights on bottom","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.38184,+-71.105853(20507)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20507) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/14/2009 01:09 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
