I consider myself to be an experienced aircraft spotter having been involved with aviation for close to fifteen years. On the night in question, I was sitting on my back porch, it faces southeast, I sit out there at night sometimes and watch air traffic line up coming from the south with their landing lights fully on, flying north in direction. These are usually flights that are going to be landing into Dallas Love Field, in this instance there was what looked to be two aircraft in line probably about five to six miles in trail, the strange thing about it all, was the aircraft bringing up the rear was closing the distance way faster than it should have been, so I turned my attention to the lead aircraft or what I thought was an aircraft. This was a very unusual light, I couldn���t tell at first but as it got closer I could tell this object was not an aircraft and they were not landing lights, it was the shape of an orb or sphere and orange in color, there is a navigational aid or VOR station that aircraft on this route use, its about three miles south of my home. Once an aircraft intercepts this station they turn northwest, the object in question seemed to stop in midair in the area of this turn point, it appeared the trailing aircraft had to make an early turn to avoid the object, once the trailing aircraft was parallel with object, the object just disappeared right in front of my eyes. I���ve seen some strange things in skies over the years that I can���t explain, but this one tops them all."],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08272008-0009","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"12238","Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-96.763083","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.808425,+-96.763083(12238)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12238) map </A>","City":"Dallas","Date of the Event":"08/21/2008 11:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"08/21/2008 11:50 UTC","trends":["There have been 116 other sightings in Dallas","There were no other sightings in Dallas on or around August 21st 2008"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
