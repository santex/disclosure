{"Region":"California","City":"Palm Springs","Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were in the pool. One guy said look and pointed south. we all watched as a solid chevron shaped flying object flw silently almost directly over our head snd continued northbound till out of sight. We thought at first it was a flock of geese but it had no sound and no movement it was solid. Someonw said it looked like a glider but it was dark out. Someone tho0ught it might be a drone from the 29 Palms Air Base but again it had no lights and was completely silent. We were pretty confused .. noone could come up with a plausible explaination for what we had witnessed. We decided it was definately unidentified..but dont know much other than that."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33092.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33092.html"],"Case Number":"33092","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/03/2011 12:45 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.831106,+-116.552962(33092)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33092) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11032011-0002","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Palm Springs","There were no other sightings in Palm Springs on or around November 2nd 2011"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-116.552962","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"11/02/2011 09:00 UTC","Latitude":"33.831106","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Chevron","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"south to north silent pretty low and very big reflected light only"}
