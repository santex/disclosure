I witnessed event over the gravel pit at intersections of clear lake rd and Harvey lake rd. Orb shaped object pulsates in intensity and color, hovering, then quickly sped through the sky from a north to south (roughly) flight path. I believe that I was witness to event posted on mufon previously reported this year, and I personally believe the information from that poster to be exactly what I witnessed. Though not immediatly spotted afterwards that night, Unmarked black helicopters have been observed multiple times at altitudes appearing to be under 500 ft. Helicopters usually make multiple passes and are completely unmarked."],"Region":"Michigan","Log Number":"US-08052013-0017","Summary":"Red-orange orb shaped object over gravel pit","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.353091,+-84.140231(49490)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49490) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON"}
