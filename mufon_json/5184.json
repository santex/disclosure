(at least 15 feet in diameter, but i'm guessing much more than that.) we live out in the hocking hills not far from old man's cave off h. 664, and have few neighbors, it would not be a very good place for a hoax. i've tried to think of what it could have been besides a high tech vehicle of some sort. it was not a conventional vehicle. not a plane, it hovered perfectly still. not a helicopter, as that close it would have made noise and what we saw was completely silent. other related sighting: the same red light that appears, flashes, spins, then dims out that i saw in between the yellow rim lights showed up again at about 10:01 pm the following evening, on august 3rd, in almost the same position, but a little further south in the sky. this time, there were no yellow rim lights however. we plan to go out tonight before 10 to see if there is any further activity. other note: we've seen some dark drab olive green military helicopters in the region in the last month, which is something neither of us have seen in this area ever in the years we've lived in this area of ohio. so there is a chance that maybe what we saw was part of some test i suppose."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"5184","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5184.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5184.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/02/2006 09:41 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.540067,+-82.407099(5184)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5184) map </A>"}
