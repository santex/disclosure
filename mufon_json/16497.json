I looked North East towards New Orleans and saw something that looked like a flare but larger and slower. I looked for an aircraft but didn't see any. The duration was a lot longer than a arieal flare. This is cliche, but as soon as I picked up my phone to call my wife, after the first ring it disapeared. My feeling at the time was excitement."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16497.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16497.html"],"Latitude":"29.474385","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/13/2009 03:34 UTC","Log Number":"US-04132009-0008","Longitude":"-90.557031","Case Number":"16497","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Montegut","There were no other sightings in Montegut on or around April 13th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON"}
