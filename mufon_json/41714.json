It was a beautiful clear night and I saw several planes in the sky. I believe in aliens and requested by thought that they make their presence known to me. With that a large star light object appeared near the brightest star in the sky... Then continued to move towards me over head very slowly, with no tail of any sort and no flashing lights. It was a solid light colour with no noise. Even the noise from th previous planes in the sky had gone. It then stopped dead over head, as I ran around to the balcony to my left to get anothe look it had vanished, with at it's prious speed couldn't have done, with no cloud present to block it from view. During the sighting I was excited and over joyed that they had responded to my request."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United Kingdom","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.098144,+-0.185983(41714)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41714) map </A>","Case Number":"41714","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Latitude":"51.098144","Date of the Event":"08/12/2012 10:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"08/13/2012 04:27 UTC","Longitude":"-0.185983","City":"Crawley","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Crawley","There were no other sightings in Crawley on or around August 12th 2012"]}
