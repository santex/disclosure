At the time my boyfriend was looking in the rear view mirror and did not see the craft. We were driving to my mom's house and passed a man standing on the road looking up at the stars. We made a joke he had probably never seen stars. Looking back I think he may have been looking at the craft. Out the front windshield of the truck I saw a round craft with 6 lights- from left to right: 4 red, 1 white, 1 red light. The craft was hovering just above the cottonwood trees approximately 60-70 feet in the air. I yelled out to my boyfriend if he was seeing what I was and to drive forward to get a better look! Then it was gone in a blink and he missed it."],"City":"Springdale","Date of the Event":"01/01/2013 08:30 UTC","Region":"Utah","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Case Number":"44953","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.189887,+-113.001028(44953)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44953) map </A>","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-01022013-0020"}
