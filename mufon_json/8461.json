I notice that we have a Debunker also posting on here again and this is your Government at it best just flat out lying. First of all if these were Flares and missiles that you claim them to be then answer me this question. We want to know why are you shooting this stuff over populated areas. Why would you endanger the American Citizens of Phoenix and surrounding areas as a possible misfire could come crashing down and endanger our people and second what are you shooting at? Invisible sky, Dead Space? If in fact these are so called missiles then there needs to be an investigation into why they are being used over the Phoenix populated airspace? We the people of the World are tired of your lies! I personally have met ET���s filmed and have pictures of them and have filmed hundreds of disks and various craft as have thousands of people around the World so you can���t lie to us anymore. We simply just don���t believe you (Shadow government) anymore. The good ET���s that are here are telling us your walls of lies are about to come crashing down. Can���t wait. Good luck with your Flare and Missile theory. We all will just keep posting the evidence."],"Log Number":"US-11262007-0002","Source":"MUFON","City":"Phoenix","Latitude":"33.452957","Longitude":"-112.064257","Region":"Arizona","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 19 other sightings in Phoenix on or around November 25th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"11/25/2007 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8461.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8461_submitter_file1__cb112507600pm.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8461_submitter_file2__cb112507630pm.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8461_submitter_file3__sm112507845pm.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8461.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"More UFO sightings over Phoenix","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Disc, Unknown"}
