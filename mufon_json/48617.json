I did and it was nothing I had never seen before. I saw 2 of them and tried to get a picture on my cell phone and couldn't find it in my viewfinder. while doing that, #3 which I didn't see disappeared from my wife's view. I kept trying to get pictures and none came out. 1. At home watching July 4th fireworks. 2. My wife saw it (more later on). 3. Strange. Not normal. 4. Round with and orange glow. There was no sound as they drifted almost directly above us. Four passed over and the third one I didn't see as I was trying to take pics. They traveled in a straight line. 5. No panic or concerns since we were not threatened. As a former fireman, I felt comfortable and not in any danger.Calm persisted. 6. They passed over our house to the North and we were on the South side. I took a glance to the North but, the position wasn't right from my viewpoint."],"Date Submitted":"07/04/2013 10:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Reading","There were no other sightings in Reading on or around July 4th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"48617","Log Number":"US-07042013-0029"}
