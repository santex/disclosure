I thought it was a star but noticed it changes coulars , it is not there every night and comes out about 45 minutes before dark. My son took a video of it and seen there is no way it is a star. I bought a telescope and started to observe it and take pictures of it every night that it was out which is about 5 nights a week. I have tried different settings on the camera and different cameras. Two of the pictures I submitted where taken on November 11. I have over 100 pictures some using the telescope some not. This past summer I had the telescope set up in my driveway and the nights it was out would take pictures of it. It would stay out for about two and a half hours. I would really like to know what this is. Thank you.Greg"],"Summary":"This is something I see out almost every night.
