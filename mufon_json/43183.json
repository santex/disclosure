I noticed a very bright light, at first thought it was Venus, but noticed the movement. At first thought maybe a high altitude commercial jet with headlights on. Noticed after a few minutes the light was much more \"white\" than the normal headlights, and the light never dimmed even after traveling across the entire sky that I could see. Perspective of the object changed, but the light never blinked, dimmed or changed in any way until the object went over the NE horizon and out of sight."],"Longitude":"-82.223847","Region":"South Carolina","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.941098,+-82.223847(43183)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43183) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"10/12/2012 11:23 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/11/2012 07:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Very Bright, Venus like.
