It was in its usual spot in the western night sky. I first saw it at 7:10pm. I watched it and about five minutes of watching it, a blinking object approached it. I think it was airplane. As the blinking object approached the orb, the aircraft went over and around it. The plane flew northwest and out of my line of sight. Shortly after that, a jet came out of northeast and flew by the object. Minutes later, a second jet would fly by closer to the object than the first one. They both left contrails in the sky. The second jet disappeared out of my line of sight. At about 7:40, the white orb disappeared also."],"Region":"Missouri","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"02/02/2012 07:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"02/13/2012 05:19 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.488675","City":"Linn","Log Number":"US-02132012-0074"}
