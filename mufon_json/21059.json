{"divs":["sighting detailsit was 7:50pm when myself, and some relatives and friends were out the back talking when i spotted a light in the sky about the size of a pea and very bright (it was cloudy and rainy ) , i looked at it other people outside in the conversation spotted it to, i thought it was a plane or a helicopter at first but it was moving so slow so i got up and grabbed my camera and recorded it out the front of my house, but while i was getting my camera set up to record, the light stopped then moved back then stopped and moved forward again. the light was moving across the sky for about 10 minutes. i checked the iss times over my area and it didnt even come over that night. the weirdest thing is that it stopped then moved back then stopped and then moved forward again. link to video- http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\watch?v=0h3qbesnima"],"Country":"Australia","City":"Brisbane","Latitude":"-27.463043","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21059.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21059.html"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"153.028942","Date of the Event":"12/19/2009 07:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-27.463043,+153.028942(21059)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21059) map </A>","Log Number":"AT-12192009-0007","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Rain","Region":"Queensland","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Brisbane","There was one other sighting in Brisbane on or around December 19th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"12/19/2009 07:48 UTC","Case Number":"21059","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Big light moves slowly across sky, stops then moes backwards and forwards"}
