I reached a round-about and there were no other vehicles coming, so I stopped to get out and listen for sound and to observe the object closer. It was moving at a steady pace at maybe 200-300 feet above me and as it traveled over me and moved away started to turn more red. Looking at it as it passed over, it appeared to have a flame inside of a ball look to the light. When I saw that another car was coming, I got in my vehicle, moved it around the round-about and pulled over to continue observing it. It slowly moved out of sight, not changing direction or speed. I didn't get the sense that the object was very big, it probably disappeared from view in a couple of miles. My feeling was that it was something unusual but still can not think of what it might have been."],"Log Number":"US-05202012-0021","Summary":"orange red fireball moving steadly over my vehicle.
