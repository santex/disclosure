On the way home I watched the light with the truck window rolled down. When I got home I thought I would take some pictures of it to see if anything turned out. I used the full zoom on my digital camera. I also was able to film the object. I tried to compare a red blinking tower on one side and the moon on the other of the object in the video. I think they showed up brighter than the object as red and a bright light, but they didn't show up very well. They also showed up on the far left or right side of the video quickly. The object is smaller and looks like it is blinking and possibly changing colors."],"Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","City":"Garland","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11277.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11277.html"],"Latitude":"32.919624","Date of the Event":"06/21/2008 12:40 UTC","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:40:00","Case Number":"11277","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/21/2008 12:40 UTC","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Garland","There were no other sightings in Garland on or around June 21st 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-96.635253"}
