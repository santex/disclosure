{"Latitude":"34.663887","Summary":"Sighting from AAFB,OK to west over FT. Sill,OK.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Oklahoma","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt is very difficult to give exact info on the observance of UFO's over the mountain range near Ft. Sill,Ok. When I was stationed at AAFB,Altus OK in 1972 to 1975 as a fire fighter many of the senior fire fighters (civilians) related stories about when they were Air Force members stationed at AFB,OK. They stated for 2 weeks they were required to stand watch over the flight line and observe directly west of AAFB and to record on paper any strange sightings of lights or objects. This was related as being odd due to the 24 hr time period required by commanding staff. They stated they had observed on many nights lines of lights and objects over the mountains west of AAFB and near Ft. Sill. I don't recall any specific sightings but that this was so big everyone on the base was involved. Having never seen any programs on TV recalling these events I have always wondered if anyone ever investigated these sightings."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44989.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44989.html"],"Case Number":"44989","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.663887,+-99.273888(44989)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44989) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"01/03/2013 05:32 UTC","Log Number":"US-01032013-0024","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Altus","There were no other sightings in Altus on or around July 15th 1965"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Altus","Date of the Event":"07/15/1965 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-99.273888","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Sphere, Star-like, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
