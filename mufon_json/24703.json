Later that day reviewing the photos a friend of mine and I saw this UFO over the volcano. This object appears in 3 of the photos. The camera is a Panasonic Lumix model DMC-TZ5. I must say that I never saw the object until reviewing the pictures. I asume that the UFO moved fastly because in a one minute lapse it flew a long distance in a strange trajectory (indicated in one of the photos)."],"Summary":"UFO over Pico de Orizaba Volcano","Longitude":"-96.934722","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=18.894167,+-96.934722(24703)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24703) map </A>","Region":"Veracruz-Llave","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24703.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24703_submitter_file1__P1050733.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24703_submitter_file2__P1050736.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24703_submitter_file3__P1050737.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24703.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/14/2010 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"MX-07222010-0008","Date Submitted":"07/22/2010 09:39 UTC","City":"CÃÂ³rdoba","Case Number":"24703"}
