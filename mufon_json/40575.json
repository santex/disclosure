Off in the distance I saw two sets of 6-7 yellow orbs of light off in the distance. My best guess is that they were somewhere over the Pineville area. I originally noticed it because on of the formations looked like the big dipper and I briefly thought that's what it was. The other formation was in the form of a circle. I initially thought they might be normal air traffic for the airport but the circle in particular puzzled me. As I continued to watch they start to slowly break formation rising to different altitudes at different rates of speed. Some disappeared, others kept rising. The only logical explanation I can think of is some sort of light being lifted by a helium ballon that seems doubtful. I'm really posting just to see if anyone else saw this. I continued to drive and lost sight when I turned to get on the highway."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Fort Mill","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/07/2012 09:05 UTC","Longitude":"-81.021914","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.024641,+-81.021914(40575)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40575) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
