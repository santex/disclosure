Chicago, overlooking Lake Michigan, I looked up to the sky. It was a cloudy day and not very many people were out. I saw what at first looked like two suns, and I thought at first that it was an eclipse. Then I saw the less bright disc slowly descending. I spoke to a woman and asked if she saw it. She shrugged her shoulders and walked off. I spoke to a couple and we talked about it for a short time. Then I left. I wish I had a camera with me. It was the most incredible thing I have seen. I should have reported it earlier."],"Summary":"Walking along the beach I saw what looked like two suns.","Date Submitted":"05/10/2010 04:08 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Chicago","Date of the Event":"05/01/2009 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"23226"}
