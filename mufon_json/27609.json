I saw them too. About 2 miles away? Then they all hovered for a few seconds. One of the orange lights started moving straight up as if in a line, until it disappeared. The other two lights stayed low on the horizon and when the 1st vanished, the 2nd light ascended, following the path of the first straight up into the sky. then the 3rd followed, exactly the same path. It took about 1.5-2 minutes for each to ascend completely out of view. Then we walked another block and saw a 4th orange light hover, waver back and forth, then ascend in a straight line. We were excited and curious. Not scared."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-02022011-0005","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.526492,+-122.668687(27609)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27609) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering,Other","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.668687","Date Submitted":"02/02/2011 11:34 UTC","Latitude":"45.526492","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27609.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27609.html"],"Region":"Oregon","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"27609","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Summary":"round orange lights"}
