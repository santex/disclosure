On Vacation in Florida,I was sitting on a deck overlooking the beach. Stargazing when what i thought was a bright star at approx. 45 degrees to the horizon (such as Venus)darted to the right (north)then straight downward seemingly into the Gulf of Mexico. I was trying to rationalize this as a flare or meteorite. But, could not explain away the right angle maneuver.... Then, to make things more bizarre.... my 17 yr. old son observed the same scenario two nights later on Nov. 30th only a few Degrees south"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"26835","Tags":"City","Latitude":"27.869471","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"stationary light suddenly darts. makes a right angle turn and shoots downward.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26835.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26835.html"],"Log Number":"US-12032010-0003","Longitude":"-82.842427"}
