(the hospital i work at is ten stories, so i thought of that as a comparison) it was a definate boomerang shaped. my daughter said it looked like a plane with really bent wings. overall it was a v-shape. it had red and yellow lights. not blinking. it was moving slower than a plane or a remote-control plane would move. (i actually thought it might be a remote control plane at first, when i decided it was way too low to be a real plane), but then it was just too big to be anything like any remote control plane that i had ever seen. plus... it was silent. i had slowed down, and was literally hanging out my rolled down window looking up at it. it was traveling perpindicular to the road that i was on. the car behnd me was honking it 's horn... obviuosly not noticing it. i wanted to chase it, but could not turn around to do so because of the traffic. the entire encouter lasted only seconds, but what i noticed was that it was low-flying, and silent. there was no sound. i am familiar with helicopters... sometimes they are landing at the hospital where i work, and even with my windows shut, i can hear them well when they are that high up in the air. this object made no noise. it was traveling at the speed of a car, not an aircraft. it was more like it was floating than flying. the craft was dark against the sky, it was v-shaped, with red and yellow lights all around the perimeter. it was the size of a very small car. larger than a golf cart, but smaller than any small plane. it was something that i could not explain. i've never seen anything in my life that i couldn't put into some kind of category in my mind. this was different. i did notice that the near-by military base was firing off flares that night. they often do that, and i am very familiar with flares and what they look like. this looked like a man-made craft, flying very slow, low, and silent through the night. i wondered if it was some military craft or something. it was flying in a direction away from the base. probably too low to be on any radar. (i think). the object was not doing any fancy maneuvering, it was just flying\\floating in a straight line, silently, and i lost site of it, when it went behind my field of vision, over the road. i couldn't turn around. or look at it as it was directly overhead and behind me. then it was lost behind a tree line. my feelings during the whole encouter were matter of fact. i was honestly trying to fit it into some file in my mind, it was only a few minutes later that it kind of struck me as really strange because there was no where to file this event. i've never seen anything to compare."],"Summary":"low flying boomerang shape size of small car with lights","Longitude":"-84.980399","Country":"United States","Region":"Georgia","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Columbus","There were no other sightings in Columbus on or around January 15th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"01/15/2008 06:45 UTC","Case Number":"8963","Object Shape":"Boomerang","City":"Columbus","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.468876,+-84.980399(8963)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8963) map </A>","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO"}
