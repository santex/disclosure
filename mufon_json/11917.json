It was about 9:30 in the evening and I walked down our sidewalk I glanced up at the night sky and noticed something odd to the southeast. At first it appeared to be a large star but it increased in size and intensity...as it did so it changed from a yellow to an orange color and then was gone. I stood there several minutes trying to figure out what I had just seen...it seemed impossibly large for a star... I stared at the spot wanting to see it again, and almost missed it because it had moved up and to the left of its last position very quickly...it repeated the size,color, and brightness change and was gone. I looked for awhile but didn't see it again."],"Summary":"Light increased in intensity going from yellow to orange and then disappearing.","City":"West Lafayette","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-86.898726","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.431429,+-86.898726(11917)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11917) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Indiana","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
