When the fire was out, myself and my husband and son started star gazing for a minute before going into the house for the evening. All of a sudden this very bright circular object appeared above the tree tops and just hovered above. The object did not look far away and what struck me was how bright it remained. Within 30 seconds the object headed silently over our wooded area and disappeared at a fast rate. Today, August 8th I noticed on the internet, articles and pictures not far from where we live, of other sightings on or around the same date we saw the object. I was astounded to see the photos where identical to what we had seen on August 6th 2013. I can't believe it! Other's in my area have seen the same object."],"Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/06/2013 10:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49622.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49622.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","City":"earlville","Longitude":"-75.331534","Country":"United States","Latitude":"43.485028","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in earlville","There were no other sightings in earlville on or around August 6th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08082013-0028"}
