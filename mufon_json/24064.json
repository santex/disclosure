I saw a bright light coming through some light clouds in the clearing above the road. It was motionless for just a few seconds then it darted suddenly to the left and disappeared behind the tree canopy. It was as large and bright as the moon but its rapid lateral movement ruled that out. I felt that since it was behind the clouds it had enough height to suggest its rapid lateral movement from a stable position would have required great speed. I thought I had seen something extraordinary. I asked my wife who was in front of me in her own vehicle if she had seen any lights in the sky. She mentioned the exact same location but thought it was a plane. I do not think it was a plane."],"Country":"United States","Region":"Connecticut","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24064.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24064.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"24064","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"07/01/2010 07:59 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.295974","Summary":"Large light, initially motionless, darted off to left and disappeared.","Log Number":"US-07012010-0003","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.295974,+-72.464156(24064)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24064) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"06/29/2010 11:00 UTC","City":"Westbrook"}
