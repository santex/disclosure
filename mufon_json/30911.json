(the past two nights my wife and i have spent the night at my grandparents farm north of town in the middle of no where. we followed all the guidelines from websites and nasa, like no lights, adjust your eyes, where to look, etc. we did everything and got a great show!) so at 8:43pm i see a bright white star looking shape (looked just like which ever planet was just below and to the east of perseus constellation that was really bright all night) rise from behind a cloud in the southern sky. just as i saw what i thought was another meteor it became 4x larger and brighter and started moving straight up really fast. with in a second it became tiny again like a star and just kept flying straight up till it disappeared. i am 30 years old and have always had a fascination for space. i have always watched the stars and hoped to see a ufo. and what i saw tonight was like nothing i have ever seen before. not like a shooting star or the meteors or a plane. this thing went straight up from where i was like it was following my zenith."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Dickinson","There were no other sightings in Dickinson on or around August 14th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-08152011-0007","Latitude":"46.885124","Longitude":"-102.79837","Date of the Event":"08/14/2011 08:43 UTC","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.885124,+-102.79837(30911)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30911) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30911.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30911.html"]}
