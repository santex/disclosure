{"Latitude":"39.965193","Case Number":"10795","Object Shape":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsFirst, this may not be a \"UFO\", and nothing was seen, only heard. Because there was an incident in nearby in Kokomo, Indiana last month, I thought I should report. I was in my house when I heard a jet going over - this happens infrequently in my area. The sound of the jet was very loud; it was loud enough that I began to think the jet was going to crash somewhere near my house. About 30 to 45 seconds had passed since I first notice the sound, when I decided to go outside and look for the jet or it's path (jet-trail). When I went ouside, (it's a bright sunny day with a few bright clouds in the sky - very nice day), I could still hear the sound of the jet, but could not see it or any trail. The sound eventually faded and I thought that whatever it was, it must have been heading East or Northeast, as the sound diminished in that direction."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Log Number":"US-05182008-0005","Summary":"sound only, loud long lasting sonic boom, no visible aircraft","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10795.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10795.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Indiana","Date of the Event":"05/18/2008 11:29 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.965193,+-86.011373(10795)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10795) map </A>","City":"Fishers","Date Submitted":"05/18/2008 11:29 UTC","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Fishers","There were no other sightings in Fishers on or around May 18th 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.011373","Source":"MUFON"}
