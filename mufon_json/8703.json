It was dark. The pill-shaped light blinked on the South horizon toward Albany and moved impossibly quickly across the sky. It blinked three more times and then a final time on the Northern horizon toward Glens Falls. It was gone in a few seconds. My reaction was that nothing I knew of could move so fast accross the sky."],"trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There was one other sighting in New York on or around August 15th 1999"],"Region":"New York","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.05722,+-73.804736(8703)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8703) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8703.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8703.html"],"Summary":"saw pill-shaped light flash five times horizon-horizon","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Latitude":"43.05722","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"08/15/1999 09:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
