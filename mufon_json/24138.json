{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07042010-0021","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsA bright moving object, in a straight trajectory, moving about as fast as a plane on the night sky, no flashing lights, no position lights, no white headlights, just a strange orange halo that did not change much as object flew overhead, from N-NW to S-SE towards Long Island Sound. Visible flight-over time from my standpoint about 30 sec. viewed from downtown Fairfield, CT. There must be many viewings from other people, since it was about 40 minutes after the 4th of July fire works had ended and people were walking home."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/04/2010 11:19 UTC","Latitude":"41.147116","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Case Number":"24138","Summary":"Silent straight moving light with orange halo.","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:35 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Fairfield","There were no other sightings in Fairfield on or around July 4th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24138.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24138.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Fairfield","Region":"Connecticut","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.147116,+-73.251732(24138)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24138) map </A>","Longitude":"-73.251732","Country":"United States"}
