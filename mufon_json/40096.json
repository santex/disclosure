(four or five objects of the same size would fit between them.) it is difficult for me to say how far behind the aircraft these two objects were. not a large distance. just as the airplane was moving towards the north-east corner of my house, i moved my binoculars away from the objects to the aircraft. when i tried to locate the two objects again, i could not find them. for the next hour i watched other aircraft in the sky, all of them flying much higher than the first aircraft. i did not see anything unusual following these other terrestrial airplanes. what makes this observation interesting? the two saucers were following the aircraft. both of them lined up one behind the other. they were not bright, but dull grey in colour. while they were about the same size as the aircraft, they were distinctly different. i'm sure that i would not have seen then without the binoculars. notes: i live about 5 blocks from the welland canal to the east. on the other side of the canal is the st. catharines airport. the sky was clear, but there was a haze that blocked most of the stars. this haze reflected light from parking lots at a mall and elementary school. i was shaded from these city lights by my house and garage and backyard trees. it was a hot but dry night. the object were seen overhead. there were no other witnesses. photos not possble, not enough light. no military bases or airfields nearby. my reaction was one of slight surprise. i've always been an alien ufo skeptic and would welcome a sensible explanation."],"Object Shape":"Disc","Region":"Ontario","Log Number":"CA-07032012-0003","City":"St Catharines","Country":"Canada","Latitude":"43.18349","Tags":"City","Case Number":"40096","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.18349,+-79.210535(40096)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40096) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/03/2012 01:10 UTC","Longitude":"-79.210535","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40096.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40096.html"],"Summary":"Sighting of two disk-shaped objects following and then line up behind a small aircraft about 10:15 p.m. on Monday night, July 2, 2012","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/03/2012 10:15 UTC"}
