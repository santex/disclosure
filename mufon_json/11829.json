The first one probably did not work as it was too dark. So I cropped and zoomed in a little. Four of us saw 2 bright lights in the north sky close to my house. They blinked off, and then 3 appeared, then they blinked off, and then 5 appeared. More like 3 on top, and two under, but forming a circle. I tried to take a picture of the orange one, but just got a streak going up and down. When I zoomed in on that on the back of the camera, after the incident was over......there was about 15 to 20 lights higher up not visible to the naked eye. But I caught it with the camera. They were in a sideways v heading east. I'm a photographer, and take alot of nature lightening shots, rainbows, planes etc. These were totally different. I used a 300mm lense at 5.6 to get this shot. Hope it comes out this time."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Five lights real close, to the north of my house. One turned orange.","Case Number":"11829"}
