{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"36252","Date of the Event":"03/04/2012 03:45 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy elevation is 3500 feet above sea level in the Sierra Nevada. I was sitting on my deck facing west, when I noticed an unidentifiable object coming in my direction from the northwest. 10:00 position from the north. It seemed large in comparison to the houses on the ridge so that ruled out balloons. When I first saw it the approximate size was ��� size of the moon and appeared to be tumbling, floating slowly and ascending as it came my direction (south east). It was white in color, and had a primary form of what appeared to be square, but that was not the complete form. It was unexplainable. As it tumbled and floated closer, the shape would change and was getting smaller as it approached. It was very silent, and did not disrupt dogs in the neighborhood. I watched for at least 5 minutes trying to figure out what it was, because the shape was so odd. I then went into the house to get my iphone. When I came back outside it was still coming in my direction but much smaller and higher. The sun was very bright, which made it impossible to see if I was positioned on the object when I snapped the pictures. It stopped moving south easterly as it was slightly over my house and sat in one position for 15 minutes. I called the National Reporting Agency, and while on the telephone with them, it then began to ascend higher until it disappeared."],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Latitude":"38.016819","Date Submitted":"03/04/2012 09:52 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03042012-0016","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-120.27955","City":"Soulsbyville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.016819,+-120.27955(36252)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36252) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36252.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/36252_submitter_file1__IMG_0156.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/36252_submitter_file2__IMG_0157.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/36252_submitter_file3__IMG_0158.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36252.html"],"Object Shape":"Diamond, Square, Rectagular","Country":"United States","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Soulsbyville","There were no other sightings in Soulsbyville on or around March 4th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Summary":"Observed an slient object that appeared to be floating and tumbling and changing shape as it approached from the North West heading South East","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON"}
