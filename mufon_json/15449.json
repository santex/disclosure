I don't know for sure what it was.I know it wasn't an airplane.I've seen several strange things like this lately.On the 3rd of Feb. I and another guy in the Kroger parking lot of New Albany looked up at sunset at this bright cirle like object moving very fast across the sky.I just got in my car and left. But he kept on staring at it.I dunno what it was either."],"Summary":"I saw an oval-like shaped object,very shiny & silver looking flying in daylight hours.I knew it was no plane when it stopped moving,then gone in 4 minutes.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15449.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15449_submitter_file1__oval-object.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15449.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/12/2009 10:25 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"New Albany","Region":"Ohio","Longitude":"-82.801136","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in New Albany","There was one other sighting in New Albany on or around February 12th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"02/12/2009 10:25 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.084104,+-82.801136(15449)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15449) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.084104"}
