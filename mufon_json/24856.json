I had noticed a flash, very brief before it disappeared nearer the middle of the sky, eastern hemisphere if you are looking directly up. I didn't think anything of it until i saw another flash, then about three seconds later, in a different location, the same flash. This happened about six times, in a zig zag pattern before, now in the northern hemisphere of the sky, it stopped happening altogether."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Flashing light, not like a plane.","Region":"Utah","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.700883,+-111.99896(24856)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24856) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07312010-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24856.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24856.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
