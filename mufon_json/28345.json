These were not fireworks. One way to describe this would be watching some sort of energy, spinning and building up speed in a circular motion, horizontal to the ground, lifting and then lowering after becoming larger as they spun, and smaller around as it lowered again disappearing into the ground. This is so hard to describe, wish i could somehow make a moving diagram for all to see, It was beautiful..almost like a hologram, very colorful orbs. I always look to see if it will happen again, but nothing yet."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around July 4th 2008"],"Latitude":"32.733379","City":"Fort Worth","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Other, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/04/2008 09:03 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-97.31473"}
