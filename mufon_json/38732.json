{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMyself and two of my neighbors were outside around 9:30 p.m., discussing a previous encounter with an orb. It was clear out. As my neighbor was telling, and showing me what he had seen, out of the corner of my eye i saw a light on the railroad tracks about 75' away. As I looked closer, I noticed it was Humanlike. It was about 7-9' tall, and human shaped, an inner light emmited from its chest. It also had long white(?)hair. I instantly said \"Holy S#!+, LOOK\" and pointed at the being, which turned apbruptly and seemed to vanish, speeding accross the tracks. One friend confirmed the same. I teared up instantly afterwords, fearful. All three of us felt uneasy. Since this sighting, I have a constant feeling of something watching. My neighbor says he also has had the same feeling. I don't know what we saw, but I would like to. Even now as I sit and type this, I have tears in my eyes. Help!
