The light went out like a switch was cut off while it was still bright and visable aprox 15 miles downrange. Many aircraft in the area with most traffic at about 30k feet, well above the object.The traffic at 30k was obviously comercial airliners out of DFW headed west to Phoenix and the west coast. Third sighting of this object so far. I have calculated the speed of the object at approx 8-900 miles an hour.Completly silent, no sonic boom and no reaction from Dyess Air Force Base.The most remarkable thing was it passed directly in front of the moon and with the help of my 10x binoculars, I saw the profile for a splt second, it was round like a tennis ball!
