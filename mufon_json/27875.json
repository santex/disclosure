So I decided to post 'em I don't bother to post my observations very often because they usually look like balloons, and if I tell people they talk to me in my mind ... well then i'm a schizophrenic. I always wanted to meet aliens and I got my wish. Unfortunately I don't think they like me."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
