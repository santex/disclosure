I was outside of Tomy's restaurant smoking a cigarette. I stepped forward a couple of steps, and looked up. To my right I saw a 1 foot in diameter lighted object. It was 35 feet high, and was traveling towards the main street (Chapman Ave.)at about 3 mph. It was very bright, and I could see it was packed will electrical equipment (components, chips etc.). When it got over the middle of Chapman Ave. it disappeared completely into another dimension. I was amazed by this, and I was prompted to think that the object was some kind of extraterrestrial experiment. Thank you."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/30/1996 08:10 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.783221,+-119.409922(9772)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9772) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Case Number":"9772","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02282008-0032","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"A very close lighted object","Disposition":"IFO","Latitude":"36.783221","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-119.409922","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9772.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9772.html"]}
