As I was coming to a stop I looked to my left and saw a silver line in the sky at remained stationary, it was at a 30 degree tilt and from the distance I could estimate that it was maybe 100 ft long. Inside the silver line there was blue and purple lights (like an aura). After about 30 seconds the light began to grow dim and i was able to make out a 3D unlit long thin rectangular shape that was immediately above where the light had been coming from. It continued to dim until I could no longer see the light or the dimmed shape. It happened so quickly that I did not get a chance to get a picture, I was kind of in shock."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.227336,+-98.192603(48259)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48259) map </A>","Case Number":"48259","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Stephenville","Longitude":"-98.192603","Latitude":"32.227336","Date of the Event":"05/31/2013 01:10 UTC","Summary":"It was a thin silver bright line in the sky, tilted at an angle, that slowly faded until it disappeared.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06192013-0017","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were no other sightings in Stephenville on or around May 31st 2013"]}
