{"Log Number":"US-07042011-0010","Date of the Event":"07/03/2011 10:30 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing on my deck around 10:30 PM looking at some fireworks to the east and saw what at first I thought was some kind of flare. It appeared just over the trees to the east of my house and looked to be climbing slowly. It started on a shallower trajectory before I lost it behind the trees to the south east. It was round with a reddish orange glow and moved about 30 degrees horizontally in a minute. Too slow to be a bottle rocket and went too far to be a flare. No lights showing it to be a plane. I would have been looking at it from it's right side where there should have been a green light on a wingtip. There were no anti-collision lights either. The weather report from the local airport in South Bend was showing broken clouds above 12,000ft and visibility over 10 miles. Whatever it was was below that."],"trends":["There have been 32 other sightings in La Porte","There were no other sightings in La Porte on or around July 3rd 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Round, red/orange glow, slow moving","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/04/2011 01:33 UTC","Longitude":"-86.71628","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.618557,+-86.71628(29907)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29907) map </A>","Region":"Indiana","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","City":"La Porte","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29907.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29907.html"],"Latitude":"41.618557","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"29907","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown"}
