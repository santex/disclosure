A cold front moved in yesterday and it's very windy and cool.The beach is empty except for a couple people.My friend and I initially just noticed the large crater it was remarkable in size and configuration but I saw that it just looked like a big hole to him and I didn't let on to my suspicions. We walked more had breakfast and walked back. The wind was blowing almost too hard to walk but more people were on the beach. Some folks went swimming and decided the \"big hole\" was a great place to put their stuff so it wouldn't blow away. By afternoon I would expect the craters to have blown nearly away or maybe not.This is the first time I have seen these craters here, ever."],"Date of the Event":"04/07/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
