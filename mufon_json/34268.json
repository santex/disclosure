{"Longitude":"-97.324535","Summary":"White light orb with red, blue, green lights","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe town of Mayville is approximately 4 miles WSW (almost West) of my house as the crow flies. My driveway is .2 miles straight and the entrance faces Mayville. At 18:45 I went to walk to the mail box. Above the grain bin lights of Mayville, I noticed a Ball of White light with Red, Blue, and Green intermittent lights which weren���t blinking, just appearing then disappearing in a seemingly random pattern. At first I thought it may have been a Helicopter, no noise, it was just hovering. I then noticed 3 single engine prop planes (used extensively in the area for crop dusting). These 3 planes were coming from different directions. You could hear their engine noises. Their flight pattern suggested there was a destination ��� one was heading North, one heading East, the other heading South. Their moving lights and sound suggested they were close to Mayville at the normal altitude positioned between me and the orb light. The orb light I saw was moving slowly toward the West and in comparison to the Prop planes was extremely bright. After ruling out a helicopter, I thought it might have been a star. A star cannot move and the cloud cover was at first above the light then the light went into the cloud cover. You could see a ���glow��� from the clouds. This was ruled out when it disappeared into the low flying clouds. The feelings I experienced at first sighting was, 'Why is there a light above the grain bins? this time of night?'. I walked a few more feet down the driveway and stopped. The light was still there. I thought it must be a helicopter. This was ruled out when I noticed it moving away slowly. My mind tried to rationalize it being a helicopter, but there wasn't any sound until the planes appeared. You could hear their buzzing plane noise then those sounds slowly disappeared leaving the orb light which was fading into a cloud. I then thought it may be a star, the orb light was clearly moving unlike the other stars. I was excited, went to get my fiance to view it, but when I came back, the whitish colored orb turned reddish in a cloud cover and the light dissipated and was gone. I was bummed because I wanted to share the event, but I didn't want to leave it because I didn't want to miss anything."],"Log Number":"US-12242011-0004","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.498041,+-97.324535(34268)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34268) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Mayville","Date Submitted":"12/24/2011 10:24 UTC","Case Number":"34268","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mayville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"12/20/2011 06:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"47.498041","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Region":"North Dakota","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34268.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34268.html"]}
