I saw it come from across the lake & stop near us and hover without making any sound. It was just above the tops of some pine trees & the trees never moved. My parents never talked to me about UFOs when I was growing up but I knew I had just seen one. I went home & told my parents & my father asked if I could draw it. I did. It was shaped like a dome but sitting on a plate. It had a pole on top with a blue light that I have never seen. There where squares that looked like windows & light would flash but never go dark. I told my parents it was like light from energy. They told me to never tell anyone because most people would not understand. The craft didn't turn around but just went back the way it came without any noise. Many years later my father told me that there was an article in The Lakeland Ledger the next morning of a woman who was sitting in her car waitng for her son to leave a party when she saw the same craft."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.040665,+-81.944154(43619)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43619) map </A>"}
