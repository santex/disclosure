Saw a large white light object descending quickly from up in sky, down to almost the ground, where I lost sight of it behind building. Went vertically down, not as any angle, like a shooting star would have, and which wold have burned out way higher in the atmosphere. This went all the way down, and was consistent in it's glow the entire way down. It seemed like a solid object moving at a rapid speed. It never impacted the ground, or broke the speed of sound (no sonic boom), from what I could hear."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.33074,+-71.437592(47490)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47490) map </A>","Latitude":"42.33074","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Framingham","There were no other sightings in Framingham on or around May 18th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"47490","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47490.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47490.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/18/2013 09:47 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
