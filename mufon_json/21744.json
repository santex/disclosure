{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Alturas","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"02/02/2010 12:04 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy roommate and I were watching TV, a very bright light flash appeared and the power went off, this happened three times consecutively, then the power was off for good. After calling the power company, I went to bed. I awoke sitting up in bed unable to move. My roommate also reported waking up in a sitting position. She got up, turned off the lights (power apparently came back on at some point) and went back to bed. She reported hearing my phone ring, which was near my bed, I did not hear it at all (?) This was sometime after 12:20am. I did not see anything outside, but across the lake, which is behind my house, I could see neighbor's lights on. When the flashes of light happened, somehow, we could both feel something through our feet. (that was strange) The feeling was like a very fast vibration, like a \"tickle\". The flashes seemed like they were extremely close to the house, I only have one neighbor, on the west side of my property, the flashes happened on the east side of my home. I have no idea if my neighbors were effected."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"three bright flashes, then loss of power","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.871693,+-81.71508(21744)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21744) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"21744","Longitude":"-81.71508","Date of the Event":"02/01/2010 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21744.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21744.html"],"Log Number":"US-02022010-0003","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Alturas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.871693","Tags":"City"}
