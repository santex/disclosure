I didn't do this to watch fireworks, I did this because oddly, my neighbor had someone cutting his grass in the dark. I walked outside to see what that was all about. When I looked across the street, I noticed an orange ball of light traveling at a brisk speed. I could see it approaching through the trees. I got my phone out (Iphone) and started to record it. (I HAVE VIDEO) When it made it into a clearing, I shot video and took some still photos. It flew over my house, and it appeared to be ascending after it past over. A few seconds after I lost visual, a second light, this time white'ish in color at an extremely rapid speed flew in the same direction as the first object. About 5 minutes later, a SECOND object looking exactly like the first one flew over again. I have video and still photos of it as well. There was no sound, no blinking lights, nothing."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 09:45 UTC","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48628.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48628.html"],"Log Number":"US-07052013-0004","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Mississippi","City":"Brandon","Case Number":"48628","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-89.967359","Date Submitted":"07/05/2013 12:21 UTC","Latitude":"32.21135","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Brandon","There were no other sightings in Brandon on or around July 4th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None"}
