It was about 8:35 at night and I was sitting in my hot tub facing east. I had my head laid back looking straight up. I saw a dim light at high altitude going fairly slow heading south east. I watched it for about 20-25 seconds. Object did sharp turn which appeared to be to the south west. The object went behind a thin, whispy cloud. A bright light flashed then went dim and went faster then first saw then just disappeared. This was a very eventful night. This was the 2nd of 3 sightings I had that night. As stated in my previous report, I am a retired Master Sergeant of the Air Force of 22 years of service. I have seen several known aircraft and have never seen anything move like this. I will be filing my 3rd report after this is completed."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37626.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37626.html"],"City":"Fountain","Case Number":"37626","Date Submitted":"04/21/2012 11:02 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-104.683302","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
