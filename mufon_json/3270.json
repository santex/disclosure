{"Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Not Provided","Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailssighting report: unusual flying, lighted, object encounter, on january 30th 2005, my father, hobart c. wilcox, and i, jan r. wilcox, began a return trip to our home in st. petersburg florida, from my cousin92s home in butler alabama. we rose early and started our journey at 5:30 am. we were traveling by car, a 1994 dodge caravan. i was driving, with my father sitting in the right front passenger seat. we were heading south on highway 17. the weather was damp and cold (45 degrees) with a slight mist but no fog. at about 6:00 am a few miles outside of silas alabama, while it was still quite dark, i noticed a very bright, pulsing, bluish white light ahead of me and to the left of the highway. the light was pulsing on and off at about one second intervals. the cadence and color of the light was very much like microwave tower strobes but was much more powerful, illuminating a rather large area of the forest tree tops directly beneath it. the duration of the illuminations was also much longer than the quick blips the tower strobes make. i asked my father if he could see this odd phenomenon and he said he could see it clearly. we were driving at about 55 to 60 mph. after continually observing and traveling about a mile, my father who has been a civilian pilot for many years after retiring from the military with 22 years of search and rescue missions on board both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, said the object, appeared to be moving at a pace similar to ours as the angle of inclination was remaining constant and we could both see the edge of the approximate 100 yard wide illuminated circle moving across the tree tops. both my father and i have military training in the observation of moving objects, night and day, as well as on the land, water, and sky. neither one of us has ever personally seen anything exactly like this light display before. after driving on about two more miles with this pulsing light pacing just ahead of us and to the left keeping a steady elevation of about 50 feet above the tree tops, we approached the city limits of silas. at this point the light suddenly stopped moving with us and fell behind. i then slowed to the 35 mph speed limit as we passed through silas but i watched the light continue to pulse in my side rear view mirror. then it just went dark and disappeared from our view. after driving on through the sleeping town of silas (we did not see a soul on the streets nor did we meet another car coming or going during this time), which only took a few minutes, as it is a very small rural town. my father and i began to discuss the possibilities of what may have been the source of this strange light, when i again noticed a pulsing light in front of us but at a very high altitude. it was hard to tell if this was the same light as it was now very small, but it had the same cadence and pulsing pattern and duration as the large light we had observed some moments before. then quite suddenly the light descended, quickly moving back toward the outskirts of silas which was then a mile or so behind us, grew in size and intensity for a couple of pulses then disappeared again. we never saw it again although we did see many radio and microwave tower lights, which we easily identified as such until the dawn and early morning sun rose. my father and i discussed the incident at length as we drove on toward florida and we both agreed the only craft that we knew of that could mimic the flight characteristics of the object we saw would be a helicopter. however, if it was a helicopter, we asked the question of why its search light was pulsing instead of being a steady beam of light. also it is pretty hard to determine what purpose and\\or what type of helicopter would be flying around an hour or so before dawn, buzzing a small rural town and forest in the middle of nowhere. an interesting footnote to this encounter is that later that morning as we drove on through the florida panhandle we saw signs indicating we were close to eglin air force base. then i remembered that i had seen some videos shot during a ufo flap in and around the eglin afb area in the late 1980=92s and some of the objects captured on those videos behaved and looked remarkably like the one my father and i had just witnessed. i also remembered that mufon was credited in this discovery channel ufo program with having investigated many of these sightings. unfortunately we did not have any equipment with us to record what we had seen so we just have our testimony and i realize that is not considered as reliable evidence, but i just thought you might be interested to know that apparently there are still strange lights in the skies in and around the florida panhandle area. sincerely, jan r. wilcox hobart c. wilcox 1\\30\\05"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/01/2005
