I didn't see any connection between them. They just flew by and disappeared behind the tree. P.S: the picture i took is from behind the window, so ignore all the little spots on the picture other then the highlighted area."],"Tags":"City","City":"Seattle","Latitude":"47.60853","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There were no other sightings in Seattle on or around September 12th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"09/12/2010 10:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-09122010-0006","Longitude":"-122.323171","Summary":"2 dark grey balls slowly flew outside my window, spinning around each other.","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"25389","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/12/2010 01:27 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25389.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25389_submitter_file1__0912000959.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/25389_submitter_file2__zoomedin.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25389.html"]}
