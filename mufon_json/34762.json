I noticed a jet flying overhead, heading southwest from Washington, DC. Directly above the jet was an object exactly keeping pace with it. The object was at least the size of the jet. It was too far above the jet to be in any way attached to it, and it was too close to be in any kind of approved flight path. The jet had a huge contrail, the object above it had none. I watched until the jet and the object flew out of sight."],"trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Charlottesville","There were no other sightings in Charlottesville on or around January 10th 2012"],"Latitude":"38.035686","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34762.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34762.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Virginia","Date of the Event":"01/10/2012 11:30 UTC"}
