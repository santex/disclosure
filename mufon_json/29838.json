At first I thought it might be an asteroid since I heard we were supposed to have a close encounter with one this week. Well I yelled for my brother to come out and we just watched it in amazment until it disapeared. It looked like a very bright start and traveled maybe the speed of a jet or slowed did no change directions at all. So afterwards I came inside and googled what it would have been and I saw two people in pennslyvania(where i am)saw the same thing last night. Well if it's back tomorro I will be sitting out there with my video recorder. It was the most amazing and cool thing any of us has seen. It's been over an hour ago and I still can't beleive it. I just wish I had it on camera, at least it's something me and my boy can remember for the rest of our lives."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"29838","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Pennsylvania","Longitude":"-77.188135","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.208202,+-77.188135(29838)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29838) map </A>","trends":[],"Tags":"City"}
