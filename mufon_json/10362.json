{"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange fireballs and light flashes in western sky","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around April 15th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"04/15/2008 09:45 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy son, Robby, was leaving to go pick up a friend. He stepped out onto our porch and immediately spotted an orange light or fireball with several flashing lights all around it. There were maybe 20-30 bright little flashing lights that were under neath the object which was triangular in shape. It moved off towards the west. Then there were 4 bright orange fireballs that got brighter then went out but the small flashing lights stayed throughout the eastern sky. Another rectangular long object with a light on each side came from the western sky but got too low behind a tree line so we could no longer see it. We tried to capture some of this on video but the video did not turn out well as our camera (a small cheap one) was unable to focus. Several planes came around the time the objects and the flashing lights left. This is the third major incident we have had in our home here. I will report this to Rodger Sugden of MUFON tomorrow morning."],"City":"Denver","Date of the Event":"04/15/2008 09:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10362.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10362.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10362.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.870283,+-86.069084(10362)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10362) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cigar, Triangle","Longitude":"-86.069084","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Case Number":"10362","Log Number":"US-04152008-0020","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Region":"Indiana","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"40.870283"}
