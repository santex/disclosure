After a few seconds, the object veered north and northeast and its light disappeared. At this time I thought I was witnessing the landing lights of an aircraft coming in for a landing. However, the lack of lights on the wings and tail was curious. Seconds later, the object reappeared farther west than where it disappeared. And again, a few seconds later, it veered north and northeast and its light was extinguished. It reappeared a second time, again further west, but shortly thereafter the tall pine trees obstructed my view. Throughout the episode I did not hear any sound emanating from the object. A few seconds later after I lost sight of the object, I observed a high flying plane high in the eastern sky moving in a westerly direction. I felt that the aircraft was following, or tailing, the object that I saw. Minutes later, a jet approached from the east (possibly from Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo?) and flew overhead, again in the same westerly direction. I am a retired public school mathematics teacher...and I must admit that this is the first time I have ever witnessed such an unusual event."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
