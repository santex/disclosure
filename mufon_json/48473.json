Time: Between 4:30 AM & 4:45 AM. Event: 5 orange orbs witnessed in the pre-dawn eastern skies from the ground in Orange, CA as I was heading to car to leave for work. The orbs were noticeably larger than planes and at first stationary before they began to drift apart. Silent. One by one, each released 2-3 smaller orbs which descended, flickered white-orange in color before fading away below the orb that released it. After the descended orbs flickered & faded, the larger releasing orbs then flickered & faded out of sight one by one. The orbs may have been in sky longer before I exited house, but I witnessed event for at least 15 minutes. Video feature on Droid phone not sufficient to capture event, but attempted."],"Date Submitted":"06/28/2013 10:53 UTC","Latitude":"36.782891","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"5 larger than planes orange pulsating orbs releasing smaller orange flickering orbs","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.782891,+-119.415732(48473)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48473) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48473.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48473.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06282013-0009","Case Number":"48473","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/28/2013 04:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-119.415732","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
