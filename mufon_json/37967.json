It was higher than the full moon. Moving from South to north direction, slowed down ,stoped,and hovered eradicially momentarally. Then reversed course and headed back south getting less firely looking as it travled,turning into just a high flying not so brite white light, as it faded away going up in a southerly direction, and out of sight. Me and my two friends talked about it during the sighting and after it was gone.None of us knew what was.Just a very strange sight to see we all agreed."],"Summary":"over top of full moon Me, 2 friends saw something in the sky that looked as if it was on fire,","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","City":"Vallejo","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-122.21716"}
