Just looked up into the night sky as I walked out of my apartment and noticed a very bright sphere going from the northwest to the southeast. At first I thought that it was zig zagging slightly but I could have been mistaken because of the disorientation I usually feel when I see these things. It stood out because the glow seemed to be brighter than the moon that was right beside it. I checked for blinking lights in case it may have been a plane but there were none, just a steady bright glow, and it flew a straight line until it started to disintegrate. It slowly started to dissolve..sort of reappeared then completely dissolved. There were no clouds for it to go behind."],"Longitude":"-119.809503","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.536653","Case Number":"8195","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Reno","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.536653,+-119.809503(8195)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8195) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"BRIGHT SPHERE CROSSING AND DISAPPEARS","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-10222007-0008","Date Submitted":"10/22/2007 07:15 UTC","Region":"Nevada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8195.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8195.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/22/2007 07:15 UTC"}
