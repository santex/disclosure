I saw the first object fly in from the south-east to north. It maneuvered in arcs, constantly changing color and pulsating. I could not make out any strobe, beacon or navigation lights. It gained altitude, hovered for several minutes and disappeared. I looked back to the south,and another identical object flew in on the same course. I called my wife, who brought her iPad to record video. The second object behaved the same as the first, maneuvering in arcs, pulsating lights, a gain in altitude, then disappearing. After the second object vanished, a third came and did the same as the first two. The video is of the third object. I am a FAA certified, instrument-rated pilot with currency privelages. I am confident this was no airplane, helicopter, glider, balloon or remote-controlled vehicle."],"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Date Submitted":"02/11/2013 12:32 UTC","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45671.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45671.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Mission Viejo","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
