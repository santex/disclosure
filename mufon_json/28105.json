Then when it started going down (and it went shooting down toward the groung) it turned from green to red and went down to the east, which would be the Minnesota side, since Grafton ND is pretty close to Minn. That Monday after the sighting that I had my boyfriend had heard something on the radio of something that went down on the Minn. side and after that I tried looking up to see if anyone else had heard or seen anything and there was nothing spoke of it again. I really want to know if what I saw was real or what because I know what I saw I just want to know if you guys have been told about it or have heard anything else on this?"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Region":"North Dakota","Longitude":"-97.410634","Case Number":"28105","Latitude":"48.412211","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/07/2006 11:30 UTC","Summary":"It was a bright green ball, that before it streaked across the sky heading to the east and went down it was red.","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/05/2011 01:23 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.412211,+-97.410634(28105)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28105) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Grafton","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
