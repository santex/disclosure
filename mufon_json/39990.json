So I opened the window and saw a missile like aircraft that looked small , passing at very fast speed above our building. It was dark or grey, but it was midnight so It was very difficult to see it on details. I was shocked and surprised by this object and its speed captivated me, its sound was like a bomb being dropped or a missile launched. I felt like something was spying on us or doing recon on the area, I didn't feel fear since my dad said it could be a us government drone. The object went fast from the sky in straight direction to the mall near my house, at a low speed, we thought it could collide then disappeared mid-air."],"Country":"Dominican Republic","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=18.468138,+-69.935678(39990)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39990) map </A>","City":"Santo Domingo","Case Number":"39990","Object Features":"Wings"}
