THE UFO appeared to be at the least the length of a football feild. It moved like a sidewinder rattlesnake not moving north&south but moving west.There were several wittnesses that watched this UFO move across the sky.My first thought was that it was an advertisement banner being pulled by an airplane.The only problem was there were no planes in front or behind it and it was in length north to south not in length east to west.THE way it moved was NOT NATURAL.You would only have to veiw the videotape we have of this strange event.Because we fear the FBI will confiscate this video it may or may not be released to the media at a special meeting of other Stephenville residents who claim they also saw a UFO. The meeting is in Stephenville this Saturday.If you have any input on this subject you may call me. Thanks. Floyd Ballard"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-01182008-0013"}
