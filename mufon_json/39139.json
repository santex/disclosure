My immediate location was considered Acworth GA but the object was over the vicinity of Kennesaw GA (my guesstimate would be near downtown Kennesaw). It was a straight shot, trees on either side. I noticed what looked like Venus...except it was no doubt much brighter, bigger, and higher in the sky than Venus ever is. Plus it was around 10-10:30 at night. Distance is questionable - it could have been a mile away or 10 miles away, I do not know. I watched it while I drove straight down that road and after about 2 minutes it just flickered out in the blink of an eye. I was driving, so wasn't able to tell whether or not it was moving, but appeared to be in one spot in the sky. Clear skies in metro area with streetlights lining the road so it was the only 'star' visible. It appeared to be miles away so my eyes could only perceive an orb-like ball of light. It was the same color as the deep-yellowish-orange street lamps (but ever so slightly more yellow), but definitely not a streetlamp because it was high in the sky. It just disappeared. Intense, bright orb-like light flickered out and vanished. There was no blinking lights that I could tell (like any earth-bound aircraft). The fact that it simply disappeared is what keeps me wondering about it."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Acworth","There were no other sightings in Acworth on or around June 1st 2012"],"Date of the Event":"06/01/2012 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.080776,+-84.588742(39139)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39139) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Latitude":"34.080776","Date Submitted":"06/10/2012 08:14 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Acworth","Case Number":"39139"}
