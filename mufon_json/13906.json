{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy dog had diarrhoea so he had me up a number of times in the night. One time, while he was making, I was in the garden and looked up and saw a white, disc shaped light moving behind clouds. The night was crisp and clear but there was some cloud cover quite high up. I don't know the exact time but the street lights were still on, I'm guessing it was about 3am. The lights were off in my neighbours' houses and they don't tend to stay up late. The light was too big and was changing direction too swiftly to be a 'plane or helicopter. There was no sound from it. Also, it was over a plain. My house is up a hill and I could see there was nothing below causing the light, plus it was behind clouds. The light moved from side to side and backwards and forwards a few times, but my dog had done his business then so I went back inside, unsure if I shoud do anything."],"Country":"Spain","Object Shape":"Cone, Disc","Case Number":"13906","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13906.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13906.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"ES-11232008-0003","Longitude":"0.03455","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.793886","City":"Pedreguer","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/23/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"I saw a white, disc-shaped light moving behind clouds, changing direction quickly","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"11/23/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.793886,+0.03455(13906)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13906) map </A>","Region":"Valencia","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pedreguer","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
