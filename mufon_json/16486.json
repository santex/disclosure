I do photography on the side and like to take pictures of the sky sometimes. So as we were driving I started snapping photos. I did not notice the object until I was looking at the pictures later. When I first noticed the object in the photo I was not sure what it was I thought UFO, but of course you always try and talk yourself out of these things. But I just don't know what else it could be. I noticed in one photo there is a red light coming down from the object. My feelings were I was excited but still am trying to find some other explanation for this. But I really feel this is what it is."]}
