I did not investigate due to I didn't have anything to record it with. On May 1st, 2013 they was back. They appeared to be about 6 in a cluster and when one headed north towards Manhattan another would come in and take it's place. Later in evening a chopper was in the air viewing them at a distance. When they came close he backed up. I get the impressing they were about the same size as the chopper. In my video attached, you will witness a Tri fly by. My feelings has changed overnight about being excited when I saw one to being concerned. Never lost sight, they were in a 1 mile cluster for hours till I could watch anymore. My brother came up on the roof and is my witness. The video has been edited to remove phone chatter and inactivity on MY part."],"Summary":"Mass Sphere sighting and one Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.721003,+-74.000573(47127)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47127) map </A>","Region":"New York","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
