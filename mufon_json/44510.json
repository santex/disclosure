{"Region":"Wisconsin","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was parking my truck and getting out, looking around as one does. I saw it come from behind my friends house and slowly travel over me before disappearing. I couldn't see anymore because of trees. It was a ball of light, seemed kind of like a fireball tht was flying slowly above me. It was hovering when I first noticed it. I thought maybe it was something burning flying as it was sort of windy tht night, but it was too big to be paper or anything. I asked my friends a few mins later as it would have hovered right over them but they hasn't seen anything."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"09/02/2012 08:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Date Submitted":"12/13/2012 02:26 UTC","Case Number":"44510","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Elkhorn","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.672793,+-88.544545(44510)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44510) map </A>","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-12132012-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44510.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44510.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Longitude":"-88.544545","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.672793","City":"Elkhorn","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Ball of light traveled over me"}
