I always look up at the sky when I walk to my car. I noticed a big BRIGHT star like object gliding in the sky. It was very quiet outside and this thing was making NO noise. It didn't move like a plane it was floating in a way, and looked weightless. It started out looking really bright then as the seconds went by it started to dim then I could see it anymore. I did get my cell phone to try an get a picture but even tho it was really bright I couldn't get it on my phone. I have a pretty good phone it takes really good pics and I havnt had this problem before."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","City":"Goleta","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/08/2010 10:36 UTC","Longitude":"-119.824729"}
