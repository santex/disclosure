As I was approaching the local elementary school, toward the North, I could see a large light sort of hovering in the sky. At first, I thought it could be the moon, but I very quickly realized that it was some sort of aircraft hanging in the sky. One thing was clear: the light was too large to be a plane. I couldn���t keep my eyes off the light, as it was so bright it could be seen through patches of trees. The light was round and had a yellowish tint to it. I continued to track the light until I lost sight of it, almost as if it had left my horizon. The experience lasted about a minute or so. Briefly after, I tried to call my father. When I connected to his phone, I heard muffled background noise. I listened as long as I could bear before I was too freaked out to continue. I called my father again, and when I connected, he claimed that I had not gone through to his phone. I���m not sure if there was some type of electrical interference, but I have never had any type of call quite like that. My hometown, Exeter, NH, is known for some of its encounters with UFO���s. The area supposedly has a high propensity due to its proximity with the Pease Air Force Base and the Seabrook Power Plant. All that I can say was that I saw some type of unnatural light it thoroughly freaked me out."],"Longitude":"-70.943945","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Case Number":"18357"}
