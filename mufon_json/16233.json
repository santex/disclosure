I turned my head quick to look at it thinking that I was going to see a plane crash and noticed that it was not an airplane. I was just east of WalMart on highway 98 in Gulf Breeze, Florida. The craft was hovering just above the trees maybe 50 yards away from me. I was so startled that I had to pull off the side of the road. I watched it for about 3 minutes. It had eight lights. They were shaped like a diamond. Four lights made up a small diamond that was surrounded by four more lights that made up a bigger diamond around it. It just hovered there in the sky not moving. I also noticed that it was not making any noise. I had the windows down in my car and I could not hear anything. After a few minutes it just diappeared. I thought that maybe I had blinked and missed it, but I could not find it anywhere in the sky. I know that it was definitely not any kind of airplane that I had ever seen or heard of before."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16233.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16233.html"],"Longitude":"-87.160747","Latitude":"30.361164","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"03/23/2009 09:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Gulf Breeze","Case Number":"16233"}
