{"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Graford","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was traveling northbound on my way to work that morning. The road visibility was excellent but the skies were overcast and the sunlight had not broken the dark, grey cloud cover. As I was going to make a left turn to the main gate entrance, I saw five lights in the sky. They were bright and white, very low to the ground,and traveling north. The lights were arranged in a some sort \"V\" shape, but it looked like a backwards checkmark. Also, I could here no sound coming from the lights. I then decided to go up to the main office since it is at a higher elevation, but when I got there I did not see the lights again. I told some of my co workers about the sighting but they just laughed at me and did not take it seriously, except for one."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01242008-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.937622,+-98.246992(9203)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9203) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/17/2008 07:53 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Graford","There were no other sightings in Graford on or around January 17th 2008"],"Case Number":"9203","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Chevron","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9203.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9203.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.937622","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"01/17/2008 07:53 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-98.246992","Summary":"Big lights in the sky."}
