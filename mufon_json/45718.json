I noticed a Vapor trail from a plane in the sky. I thought the ball of light was light reflecting off the plane, but the contrail was a ways back from it. Then another ball of light appeared and moved faster than the plane. It disappeared ahead of the plane. The first light was moving the same speed as the plane and it then disappeared too. During this time I called for my friends to look but it was too late."],"Latitude":"39.77351"}
