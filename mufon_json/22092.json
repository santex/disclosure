I got on the roof with my laptop ��� my only other picture taker other than my phone ��� set it down on the roof, and snapped one. I then climbed back down to take a look at the picture before sending it off. I'm guessing that the object in the upper left of the frame is a bird that passed over me just before the web-cam picture took. But the other \"objects?\" to the right however. There are 3 of them, they are cone shaped, and they fade each further in to the distance towards the East. I didn't see those when I took the picture. Then again, I wasn't looking that closely as the web-cam doesn't have an eye-piece. Also upon reflection, I heard no unusual sounds while I was up on the roof. About 5 minutes later, I went back up on the roof to take a few more shots from the same perspective, but I didn't pick up anything out of the ordinary. I've tried to explain their presence as glare, reflection, or weather balloons, etc - zooming in on them and asking certain rational questions. Their height off the ground and their solid appearance is truly baffling to me, and I would like to know if weather balloons can be \"Bell shaped\" or could possibly hang this low for such a short time. If you, or someone you know can answer these questions for me, I'd certainly appreciate it. Thank you for your interest and your commitment to these types of events.
