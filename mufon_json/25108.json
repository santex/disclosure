A few minutes later at approximately 103am right in the middle of the storm, the area went very quiet and I saw some bright lights coming into the bedroom. I turned around to expect to see some more lightning, but then noticed that the light was coming from a point source above the tree line and it appeared to be just sitting there. At first I thought it was a streetlight but then realized that it was too hight to be that. I checked the clock and it was 105am at this point. I looked back at the bright white light and thought it very odd to be there. I also looked away a couple of times just to make sure I wasn't \"seeing things\", but it actually seemed to be there. It looked light a white flare but it was a reality large one, kind of like a car headlight. The actual size of the light is difficult to determine, but the location appeared to be over downtown Fort Erie (maybe). I stared at it for a couple of more minutes, until it disappeared. Exactly where it went, I am not sure. I actually don't know if it moved away or just turned off. In any case, after the light disappeared, the storm returned and there was some off bursts of rain that came down. Thats pretty much it, very odd."],"Case Number":"25108","Log Number":"CA-08162010-0005","Date Submitted":"08/16/2010 11:57 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.907226,+-78.962284(25108)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25108) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ontario","Latitude":"42.907226","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25108.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25108.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Fort Erie","There were no other sightings in Fort Erie on or around August 16th 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright white light, similar in intensity as a flare.","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"Canada","City":"Fort Erie","Tags":"City"}
