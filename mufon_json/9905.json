{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe stopped in the parking lot for Albertson's and got out of the car. What I heard next sounded kind of like a waving, muffled sound. I at first thought it was a stealth bomber, because of the shape of the object, which was difficult to discern. There were three three white lights that were very still, and there was a blinking light in the center that was white and blue. It was low enough that if I were standing on the roof of the grocery store, I could have almost touched it. It was moving exceptionally slow, almost stationary. I then went into the store for maybe a minute or so, came out, and it was completely gone. To note, right after this, the F-16 fighters from the nearby airforce base (Hill) started to fly into the sky in the general direction of where the object was."],"Case Number":"9905","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9905.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9905.html"],"Longitude":"-112.020254","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.113707,+-112.020254(9905)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9905) map </A>","Region":"Utah","Summary":"UFO over Albertson's in Clearfield, UT","City":"Clearfield","Log Number":"US-03102008-0013","Date of the Event":"03/10/2008 08:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Clearfield","There were no other sightings in Clearfield on or around March 10th 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"03/10/2008 08:45 UTC","Latitude":"41.113707","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States"}
