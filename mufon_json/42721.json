I instantly saw a perfectly formed rainbow in a circle around the sun! It was incredible and I couldn't beleive how beautiful it was. No one else is around to see this as I took four pictures from different angles within a one minute time frame. I have had many profound rainbow experiences and thought this was just one more event to remember. About 5 minutes after I took these pictures a woman came out of a store and I had to point out the spectacle and share my find. I drove home and later looked at the photos only to find it was also another UFO event as well! I immediately looked online to see if anyone else had seen this event, all I could find was a man in China witnessed the rainbow around the sun only."],"Latitude":"35.484783","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09222012-0001","Region":"North Carolina","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Asheville","There were no other sightings in Asheville on or around September 2nd 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"42721","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42721.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42721.html"],"Longitude":"-82.556152","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.484783,+-82.556152(42721)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42721) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/02/2012 03:20 UTC","Country":"United States"}
