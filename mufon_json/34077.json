I was looking straight up east and saw a very quick meteorite from north to south at about 8 P.M. So I thought that it was a good night for more viewing. I turned to the west and stared up near the constellation Cassiopeia at about 8:30 P.M. I said what is that?, to Nick. I thought it was a cylindrical object spinning on its long axis. Nick, whose eyes are probably better than mine, said, it looked like 3 points of light length wise and the two out side lights were spinning around the center. It was silent(no drone sound) and it flew between Cassiopeia and the moon before fading and the whole flight took about 15 seconds to pass. We watched it fade as it passed the moon. I felt that it could be a spy satellite, since I've heard of them flying north to south before, from a friend."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"12/17/2011 03:42 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.203923,+-79.866834(34077)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34077) map </A>","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Hamilton","There were no other sightings in Hamilton on or around December 3rd 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34077.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34077.html"],"Case Number":"34077","Longitude":"-79.866834","Log Number":"CA-12172011-0011","Summary":"It flew north to south.","Region":"Ontario","Date of the Event":"12/03/2011 08:30 UTC","Country":"Canada"}
