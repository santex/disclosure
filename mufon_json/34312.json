I and 2 other people, in my family, were outside after I had observed a UFO 30 minutes earlier. We were sitting outside of the house on the patio and observed 4 lights traveling at cloud level, and going through the 1 big cloud over the coast and lighting the cloud up orange, as it came onshore. The object traveled above the Loxahatchee River being visible for 3-5 minutes and then the objects, following one another, turned SW and then flew off into space at a 45% angle. The entire encounter is caught on 3 videos by 1 of the witnesses with me, who is my son, and the other is my brother."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None, Unknown"}
