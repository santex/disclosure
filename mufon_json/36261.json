I looked out the back window to see an overcast sky with a few snow flakes falling. Just then I noticed a faint hue of light moving in the clouds. My camera is always ready to go and was sitting on the kitchen table. I was looking south and noticed that it was now on a determined path to head north. I kept snapping pictures as it went over my house. When I ran to the front window I could not pick it up again. The attached was shot into the clouds using a 16 megapixel camera with night vision capabilitied and zoom. Looks like a Chevron or Triangle."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Alberta","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"53.527545","Summary":"Sherwood Park - Chevron or Triangle","Log Number":"CA-03052012-0007","Object Features":"Wings","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36261.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/36261_submitter_file1__Mar3,2012.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36261.html"],"Case Number":"36261","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Chevron, Triangle","Date Submitted":"03/05/2012 09:56 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-113.26111","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.527545,+-113.26111(36261)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36261) map </A>","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Sherwood Park","There was one other sighting in Sherwood Park on or around March 3rd 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"City":"Sherwood Park"}
