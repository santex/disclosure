{"Summary":"Ball of Energy?","trends":[""],"City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/04/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsas usual i was on my balcony on the 20 plus floor. on clear nights i observe the night sky with my night vision monocular and usually film satellites and unidentified objects. on oct 3th 2012, at 2200 i filmed what seemed to be a transparent orb. i rarely see these and have filmed them before. this time the orb was about 100 plus feet from the balcony facing west and stopped. normally these orbs travel so fast and different directions, impossible to film at times. i decided to play around with the focus on my monocular in the event all these orbs are out of focus objects. i was surprised to say the least what i resolved after focusing. the video explains it all. the object travelled towards me and changed direction a couple of times, closest it came to me was about 50 feet, reason i was able to have a clear night vision capture of the object. the size i would say double the size of a basketball or bigger. i have no idea what this is and can tell you they travel very fast in all directions with a purpose, so definitely intelligent. the following night i filmed approximately 4 others hovering and travelling between the downtown condos, or it could have been just the one object. i now know how to capture these ufos, some call them fast walkers, or foo fighters, whatever it is, they resemble a ball of energy but completely invisible to the naked eye, even at 50 feet from me. i would love answers as they are in our skies..
