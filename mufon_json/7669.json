They looked like they were playing a game of leapfrog. They were making maneuvers that, if not regulated by an inertial damper, would turn an ordinary human to jelly on the back wall. Then one of the lights shot off to the south at a near unimaginable speed (at least 5 to 7 times, or more, faster the the old concorde planes could do). Then that light shot straight up at what I can only describe a FTL or faster than light speeds into space. Needless to say I was shocked! I felt I couldn't tell anyone or make a police report because of possible ridicule. I did, however, tell one friend and he made light of it by sayin, and I quote, \"Lookout! Here come the MIB's! (Men in Black)\" It was only recently as I just heard about MUFON, that I felt comfortable about telling someone about it. Thank you for your time. -- Scott P.S. Unfortunately, I didn't have my camera at the time, so I have no pictures to post."],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Case Number":"7669","Latitude":"40.027812","Date of the Event":"06/01/2004 05:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Monticello","There were no other sightings in Monticello on or around June 1st 2004"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Dancing lights","Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.027812,+-88.573398(7669)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7669) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7669.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7669.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/01/2004 05:30 UTC","City":"Monticello","Longitude":"-88.573398"}
