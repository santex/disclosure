So I will only comment on this creature. I had been hearing clicking noises lately every time I came out of the front door, but I could never tell where they were comming from. So on the night of August 4, 2011 at 9:35 pm I took camera in hand and decided to stand out front and listen for the noise again. When I heard it I snapped this picture. there seems to be lots of them here, but this one seems to be the only one that has tried to communicate."],"Region":"Missouri","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"A bluish/green small humanoid like creature riding on craft with appendages","Case Number":"32454"}
