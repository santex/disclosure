The object was North of the big dipper when I was looking at it at 8pm in eastern sky. It looked like it was blinking red and blue but looked different than any other star that was blinking. I first saw this at about 8pm in the eastern sky. I went outside to look again at 2am and it was still in the same spot in relation to the big dipper and was now almost straight over my house. I saw a lot of lights (maybe 1 every 5 seconds) headed very fast toward the object they looked like smaller stars with a golden hue. These were not meteors."],"Summary":"Blinking Object By Big Dipper Never seen Before","Longitude":"-117.564438","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"33.877594","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Corona","There were no other sightings in Corona on or around November 17th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.877594,+-117.564438(26659)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26659) map </A>","Region":"California","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26659.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26659.html"]}
