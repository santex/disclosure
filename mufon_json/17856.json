The object was at app. 5,000ft altitude traveling a straight and level course southbound towards the town of Cloverdale at an estimated speed of 100mph. When the object was directly overhead we observed the object appeared to be circular or saucer shaped with 10-12 orange lights surrounding the rim. No sound could be heard from the object. We watched it until it disappeared to the south. No more than two minutes later another object appeared of the same size, shape, and light color and configuration as the first. The second object was traveling what appeared to be the same course and speed as the first and at the same altitude. We watched that object until it disappeared on the horizon the same as the first."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Two sets of circular lights in the night sky."}
