Standing on balcony we spotted very, very, bright light over south, between 2 Antennas of one building. I started taking pictures with my iPhone4S with HDR mode (2 photos in one shot) with different zoom. Event took place January 26 2013, 5:19PM, New York Time. The Bright Object was moving about 4 minutes very slowly to the left and slowly disappeared. It was Very Bright for human eyes and I could not capture that brightness on the iPhone! Not on photos and video I took. I can't tell how big it was and how far away from me. There is also a helicopter on photos. After zooming pictures on computer You can see better what it was. It looks like \"Saturn Like\" spaceship. Sighting lasted about 4 minutes. I have positive feelings about it, because we already know, that we have never been alone in the Universe Ha Ha!!! :)"],"trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were 4 other sightings in New York on or around January 26th 2013"],"Region":"New York","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/27/2013 03:08 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"40.725168","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45428.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45428.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.725168,+-73.987066(45428)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45428) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-73.987066","Log Number":"US-01272013-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"45428","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown"}
