{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in the car with my friend who was driving. We were going to REI and traveling Northwest on Copley Drive in San Diego. We were traveling on the road just before the store at the following approximate coordinates: 32���50'19.89\"N, 117��� 9'41.68\". As we were driving I looked out over the military airport adjacent to us and towards the two mountains in the distance, this was in the northeast direction. In the sky about 200-300 feet off the ground and several miles away past the airfield was a craft hovering in place with an intensely bright white-blue light that flashed with a period of about one second. The light was unbelievably bright considering there was still daylight and the sun had not completely set. The light flashed bright a dim several times as both I and my friend watched in complete disbelief. We pulled over and watched the flashing until it abruptly stopped all light discharge altogether. As I watched, I noticed a strangely shaped, powder gray structure visible when the light dimmed and did not obscure the craft. It had a flat bottom and three large ridges on the top and was extremely large considering it's distance. I would say it would have to be at least a mile wide. We pulled into the parking lot of the REI store and stood on top of the car in order to see the location better in hopes to re locate the object. Just as we exited the car a flight of 3 F-18 Hornet fighter jets in a triangular formation flew overhead at a low altitude to the exact point that the light was seen. They created much noise and seemed to come from the coast as if they were deployed from an aircraft carrier. We went into the store for about 20 minutes to complete our business and then we left and upon leaving it was starting to get dark. While in the store we heard the noise of many jets and when we exited and looked into the sky there were over 25 military aircraft of all types in the area. Both my friend and I had never seen so many aircraft deployed at such a low altitude in our entire lives, the sound of Jet engine was eveywhere, there were aircraft of all types blanketing the area and they were not taking off from the adjacent airbase. As we drove we felt very apprehensive and worried about what we had just saw, we traveled down Copley Park Place headed due east. This road is only a slight distance form the previous coordinates. As we drove, far in the distance we both observed a very sharp point of bluish light traveling at a slight downward angle at an extremely high speed. It was moving faster than the military aircraft that were around it and undoubtedly observing it. The number of aircraft that were in the sky at this point is unfathomable, more than I or my friend had ever seen at one time. As we continued driving, I'm not sure of the exact location we both saw a small, dim, but visible light at a very high altitude. The light was flashing with a period of many one millisecond like a strobe very high in the sky. I know of no aircraft that would bear such a light. By this time many of the people in cars that I saw were perplexed by the many jets in the air and helicopters had at this time also entered the area. I want to stress the sheer number of aircraft that were deployed and the fact that they flew in from multiple locations with bright green underwing lights on, suggesting that they had used the lights to aid in equipping underwing weaponry. It was about an hour before the fighter activity subsided. I would like to be further interviewed and would be happy to send pictures I have drawn"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.724269,+-117.149295(8991)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8991) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8991.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8991.html"],"Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Region":"California","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-01172008-0031","Summary":"I looked across an expanse of desert and I saw a massive bright light hovering in place in the air. the light was flashing and was emanating from a strange craft.","Longitude":"-117.149295","trends":["There have been 151 other sightings in San Diego","There were no other sightings in San Diego on or around January 16th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"01/16/2008 05:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"8991","Latitude":"32.724269","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"San Diego","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/16/2008 05:30 UTC"}
