The skies were mostly clear but there were some patches of clouds. I was scanning the sky hoping to catch sight of my first meteor when off to the west I noticed a bright white light. At first I thought it must be the landing lights of an aircraft that was heading towards me, but I soon realized that the light was moving in a southerly direction and that ruled out landing lights. In addition I could not see any navigation lights nor any strobe or beacon. I next thought that I may be seeing a satellite that was traveling just above the horizon but it just seemed too bright to be such. I put my binoculars on the object and that verified my feeling that it was not a satellite nor a aircraft. The light was of a very bright intensity and very white in color. The intensity and color remained constant. It traveled at a constant velocity and did not seem to change direction or height. The light then went behind some trees that were about a half a mile away or so. The light would disappear as it���s view was interrupted by a tree and then reappear when the view was unobstructed. When the light passed beyond the trees I was then able to see that the light was fairly distant, maybe 5-10 miles away and that it was traveling fairly rapidly. Faster than a jet aircraft would have gone at that distance and much slower than a meteor. Its��� size was about 5-8 times that of the biggest star in the sky. About the time I came to the conclusion that this light was not a normal aircraft or celestial object it disappeared. There were some trees on a distant hill and I couldn���t tell whether it had gone behind those trees or if it had just left the sky. I looked for it for several minutes and kept checking that part of the sky for the next couple of hours but never caught sight of it again. The whole sighting lasted maybe 4-5 minutes. I did see a total of 55 meteors that night. Since it was just a bright light I didn���t think there was must use of reporting it, but when I read that there have been other sightings of a similar nature in the state I decided to file this report."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Region":"Oregon","Date Submitted":"08/15/2007 10:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.533052,+-122.668467(10446)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10446) map </A>","Summary":"Very bright light traveling at a fast speed.","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
