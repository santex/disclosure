I mentioned that it was a medical helicopter as we are directly in the flight path of UW Med flight. I started to take notice as it got closer to us, the object emitted a bright white searchlight flash and then turned orange in color. It continued to do this as it got closer. I assumed it was a helicopter and it would turn toward the hospital but it continued its path directly over our house at an altitude of 1000 ft I estimate. As it neared our house, the lights started to fade and the object became dimmer. As it flew directly over, I looked straight up at it and saw a solid odject with a haze surrounding the edges. I could not make out any outline other then my daughter thought it was circular in shape. It was not a helicopter. No sound was emitted. As it flew over the object started to disappear until it faded away."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"07/21/2012 10:15 UTC","Case Number":"41046","trends":["There have been 60 other sightings in Fitchburg","There were 60 other sightings in Fitchburg on or around July 21st 2012"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07222012-0062","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Disc, Fireball, Flash, Oval, Sphere","Latitude":"43.003655","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.003655,+-89.421252(41046)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41046) map </A>","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41046.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41046.html"]}
