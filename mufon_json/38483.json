{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving a semi-truck northbound on IH-35 about 40-50 miles of San Antonio,TX. In the sky above me i saw what i thought was lightening illuminating a section of the sky and i looked up and saw what looked to be a straight line of brilliant white light shoot across a section of sky. My immediate impression was that it was an meteorite or something burning up as it came closer to the earth. However, it was the same color and appearance as a bolt of lightening, and simply shot straight across the sky for maybe 2 seconds before ending. It left an afterimage in the sky very similar to a lightening strike, but there was no thunder. It lit up the few clouds in the sky which is what caused me to look up and wonder if it was lightening, and that's when the streak of light appeared. It was almost like a laser beam that lasted 2 seconds. I've seen shooting stars before and this looked nothing like that. It went straight across the sky and was as bright as lightening. It has left me curious as to what it might have been. I'm sure other drivers saw it as well."],"Log Number":"US-05242012-0015","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38483.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/24/2012 03:48 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Texas","Date of the Event":"05/22/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-98.487868","Summary":"looked like lightening but a straight line","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There was one other sighting in San Antonio on or around May 22nd 2012"],"Case Number":"38483","Latitude":"29.431342","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.431342,+-98.487868(38483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38483) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:05","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","City":"San Antonio"}
