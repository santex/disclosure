Before viewing what we could not ID We watched a satellite move overheadand saw planes flying towards Boston. We saw some shooting stars as well. Then Inoticed another satellite and saw it was not one light, but three shaped in along triangle moving SSE in unison. Two lights followed the first. It did notseem to obstruct any stars that I noticed. It may have, but I was not watchingfor that.When we first saw it we were facing south. It was around 2 oclock high, belowthe elliptic and east of the Milky Way.It appeared to be moving at a similar speed of most satellites and towards theSSE. We watched it for just a couple of minutes before it faded out. If I heldmy arm out straight and placed the object between my finger and thumb it wasabout an inch."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.319538,+-71.641179(3204)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3204) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.319538","Summary":"3 lights in a triangular shape move like a satelli","Case Number":"3204","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3204.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3204.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City"}
