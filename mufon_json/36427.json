I was standing in my backyard in River Rouge, MI facing North(the Dtroit River is to my East) when I saw a bright orb like object get extremely bright and in a matter of second shot upward at tremendous speeds without any sound. I tried to take out my cell phone and take a picture but by the time I grabbed it out of my pocket, the object was out of sight. Just estimating, I say the object had a diameter of about 15-20 m, the light streak omitted was at least five times the length of the object and was light blueish white in color. It was about 5-7,000 feet in the sky (much lower than a plane landing at detroit metropolitan airport), but when it left it was up in the stars and out of sight in a matter of at most 4 seconds. Weird!! This was my third sighting of a UFO over River Rouge in the past two years!! Any explanation to help me rationalize this?"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.338487,+-83.039774(36427)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36427) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.039774","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"03/12/2012 03:27 UTC","Log Number":"US-03122012-0018","trends":["There have been 56 other sightings in Detroit","There were no other sightings in Detroit on or around March 11th 2012"],"Summary":"orb gone from my sight in less than 4 sec","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere","City":"Detroit"}
