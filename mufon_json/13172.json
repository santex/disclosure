(see pics below). i then took another pic out my driver���s side window, which was not very well aimed. the second pic doesn���t show as much stuff around it, but you can tell it is there. i continued to watch it for 5-10 minutes more as it started to fade a bit and went behind some trees. would like to know if anybody else saw this or got pictures."],"Disposition":"Hoax","Latitude":"47.690028"}
