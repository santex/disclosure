{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was venting to a friend on the phone. i live near a pond, i had just gotten out of work it was about 1:30am october 10th. i was sitting in a fold up chair with my supper in my lap when i noticed lights, they weren't very bright. they were large dim lights about the size of a small car's hub cap 16\"-18\". They appeared to be that size guessing from the distance. it was at the other end of the sky NE of me. i couldn't see any structure in between the lights just the lights. they were lined up like ducks, like a triangle without the bottom line. there were about 6-8 lights on each side and it seemed to be maybe 100ft above the pine trees. it crossed the sky right over me towards the SW then the lights just faded out. it didnt zip off or anything the lights just faded out but the craziest thing about it is there was absolutely NO sound which being that close eliminates anything man made. I just wish someone else saw and or reoorted it cause im stil shaken up and wondering if im losing it but i know what i saw and it was way to low, big and silent to be of the world."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.258003,+-69.442799(51516)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51516) map </A>","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"51516","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"10/10/2013 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/13/2013 02:31 UTC","Latitude":"45.258003","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"it appeared out of no where, flew by the faded","Longitude":"-69.442799","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Maine","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Log Number":"US-10132013-0016","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51516.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51516.html"]}
