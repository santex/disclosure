The light stayed about a minute then just kind of faded. The misty light lingered after the main light disapeared. I have seen ufo's before but this was nothing like I have ever seen. This is a populated area. I was on my deck and it is a very clear night. I thought it might be a helecopter at first,but no way. I was stuned at what I was seeimg and a little freaked out.
