I was noticing on how clear the sky was in we were pointing out stars to each other. Out of the corner of my eye i saw this red flashing and pulsating light. It was so far up it looked star-like. I didn't really know what it was. It seemed to not be making any noise at all. I have never witnessed anything like this it was a little exciting. It was going in a straight path heading west. My boyfriend and I watched it until it dissappeared behind the houses. I had to immediately go straight to my computer and do some research and here I am. I wish i had a camera to record this amazing event!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Moore","Object Features":"Unknown"}
