On the opposite side of the freeway I see a huge red ball of light slowly descending. I sped up to see it's path as the hills it was over obstructed my view and when I did so I lost sight of it. *Note: This is the second time I have seen a UFO in this exact location. The first time was about a year ago on the other side of the hills and was 3 (points) of white lights that formed a triangle and seemed to quickly pass right alongside the freeway going north."],"Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"US-02242013-0009","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.780981,+-119.410432(45860)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45860) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45860.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45860.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
