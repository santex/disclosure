We went out onto the porch and turned off the porch light and being out in the country it was pitch black and you could see all the stars in the sky beautifully....out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash which my husband was apparently looking directly at and describes as simialar to a shooting star but tearing across the sky in a split second and much brighter....a few seconds later I saw one on the opposite side of the porch and it looked like someone cut a slit in the sky it was so bright....gone in a second....then another about a minute or so later as I was looking behind the house.....so we saw 3 in all....incredible and strange....dont know what this was but never seen it before.....will keep paying attention to the sky! We had to come in because it is way too cold out....but something def odd....Would have taken pics but my camera cant pick up the stars as it is not the greatest camera unfourtunatly"],"Tags":"City"}
