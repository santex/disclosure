not to mention the lighting would have to be timed perfectly. we speculated it could be a hobbyist project or one of those toy ufos. it flew across the entire skyline well out of the range of radio control. and the brilliance of the light looks like it would be quite out of the range of most consumers' budgets. i really do wish more people could have seen how bright it was. those are really the two things about this sighting i cannot wrap my mind around. how it was just able to stand still then drift slowly without making any noise. and how it was able to project such a bright light. normally with lights, the brightest part is usually visible when its directly pointed at you. this thing seemed to have that effect despite what angle it was at while flying over. as if the light was focused on all points instead of one. after it flew away out of view (continuing its consistent light behavior) i stood outside for the rest of the night wondering what it was, what it wasnt, and if anyone cared. i called the police when it first showed up because when it was stationary and pulsating, i didnt know if it was something about to hit the ground or what. i am not a fan of false reporting but i cant help but wonder if i reported something else more severe to get them out there quicker would have been overlooked once they saw what we saw. i would have been willing to risk it and will risk it in the future just to get a more authoritative witness to this. they were kinda dismissive and skeptical as i would have been 2 hours prior. i wish i could show you more and explain more. but really like most others, you had to be there. i will promise everyone this though, i will start investing my money in more night-friendly camera equipment. i dont care how much it takes. this changed my life and my whole view on things. thank you for your time. the videos i include are directly from the camera's memory card. no tampering has been done in anyway."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-117.679648","Log Number":"US-08092011-0108","Date Submitted":"08/09/2011 04:20 UTC","Summary":"Small object with rhythmic bright light.","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Lake Forest","There were no other sightings in Lake Forest on or around July 7th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Lake Forest","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00"}
