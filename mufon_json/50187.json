On August 22nd, 2013, we were camping at my partner's mom's cabins by Toulouse Bay on the Sagamok First Nation. At 11:30 pm we were enjoying a fire and discussing the day's activities. When I looked up, I commented on how you can see the stars so clearly when your out of the city. It was then I saw a bright light moving at a high rate of speed. I quickly grabbed my Sony HDR-HC3 camera which had a wide angle lens on it already and began to film this object. I filmed for approximately 2 minutes and do not know what this object is. After showing the footage to various members of the community, there have been other reports of strange objects in the sky. What is this that we filmed?"],"Date of the Event":"08/22/2013 11:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.214675,+-82.073676(50187)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50187) map </A>","Case Number":"50187","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-82.073676","Date Submitted":"08/26/2013 12:49 UTC","Region":"Ontario","City":"Massey","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"CA-08262013-0013","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50187.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50187.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Massey","There was one other sighting in Massey on or around August 22nd 2013"],"Latitude":"46.214675","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Shape":"Circle, Diamond, Oval, Teardrop","Source":"MUFON"}
