{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailsmy husband was following me home when i noticed people outside there homes on the phone looking up...people were pulled over outside the vehicles on phone looking up...i knew i had to see what the deal was. i pulled over jumped out and looked in the direction all the people i had seen looking. i witnessed a brightly illuminated(blue) object in the sky. it was just right there motionless(or so it seemed to the naked eye) not too much higher then out tallest building of around 12 floors. it was unlike anything i have ever seen. my husband pulled up next to me and i told him to hurry and look. we sped home to witness this with out children and grab our binoculars for a closer look. the object seemed to slowly move closer then stop. at first the shape was round and bright blue in color. we took pictures. it changed color to a solid orange\\red, then began changing shapes. pear shape, round, oblong, oval, as well as changing to being outlined in orange\\red. i made sure i was propped against car to steady my arms as we were looking through our binoculars and discussing everything we were seeing. the object made irratic darting movements, causing me to constantly have to re-find and re-focus it. after about 5-10 min. it slowly slowly began drifting up at about a 70 degree angle. as it got higher it again changed color back to the brilliant blue only outlined this time. by the time it was almost out of sight, passed the stars, it was barely even light outside. it was awesome"],"Latitude":"33.400676","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Roswell","There were no other sightings in Roswell on or around September 15th 2008"],"Summary":"bright illuminating blue object that changed colors and shapes","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"New Mexico","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Other","Log Number":"US-10122008-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13016.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13016.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Disc, Egg, Sphere, Teardrop","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Roswell","Case Number":"13016","Longitude":"-104.516204","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/15/2008 06:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.400676,+-104.516204(13016)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13016) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/15/2008 06:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
