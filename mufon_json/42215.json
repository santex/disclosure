I happen to see 4 white bright lights in the distance ahead of me and for some reason just thought it was 2 airplanes coming into an airport nearby, thinking about this after the fact you would not see two airplanes fly into an airport basically wingtip to wingtip especially at night and the airport was farther than I had originally realized. Then just before driving through Nye,Wisconsin the trees blocked the view of these 4 lights for a short while and I gave these lights no further thought. Now, as I came into the small town of Nye there was this ball of fire, that I could see in my upper left in a clearing ahead of me. This ball was on fire and the fire was equally distributed around the sphere. The ball of fire resembled, for example, a sphere of water with small waves equally around the surface but instead of water it was like small waves of fire. As I got closer I could look at it out my open drivers side window to my left at about tree top level just hovering silently. A car happen to be right on my bumper so I drove ahead a short distance and turned around to see this ball of fire, but when I got to the location the ball of fire was gone. I really did not know what to think it happened so fast."],"Log Number":"US-09022012-0008","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Nye","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"42215","Latitude":"45.314408","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42215.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42215.html"],"Longitude":"-92.58048","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
