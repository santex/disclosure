I have seen the flashers or strobes for a few weeks now and they seem to react to my requests. Also saw a Non-Lit Cigar object yesterday night with my girlfriend. I have also been reading all the Pa reports and I must say they are visiting this area. Tonight as soon as I went out to the porch they flashed me and I asked for another flash to comfirm and got the second flash. I am a contactee and have experenced many things and am not suprised by the reaction I got tonight. Anyone in Bucks County keep your eyes open and you may see something as they are around this area.
