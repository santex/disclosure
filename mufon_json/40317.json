We listned to see if we could hear a motor or helicopter blades, but there was no sound. The object seemed to move at a good pace and the light was steady. We watched it until it disappeared into the cloud cover at the horizon. The orange glow was prominent when it was overhead, but not as much as it went farther away. It reminded me of the ISS with the way it moved, but the color and the fact it was below the clouds made it clear it was not ISS."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40317.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40317.html"],"City":"Galena","Log Number":"US-07062012-0032","Latitude":"40.215062","Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.215062,+-82.879901(40317)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40317) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 10:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Galena","There were no other sightings in Galena on or around July 4th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Glowing orange sphere over Alum Creek Dam area after the Fireworks"}
