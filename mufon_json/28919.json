It was approximately 45 degrees high in the sky. Moving to the northwest. Not much noise was emminating from the \"object\" Just the slight sound of air friction. Th bright orange glow appeared to be attached to an object that had no lights. The only sort of body that could be detected was perhaps the void in the center of the fireball. However no object could be discerned. I continued at an even clip until I lost sight of the fireball behind the treeline, it did not appear to be losing altitude. The whole incident lasted approximately 2-3 minutes. My best guess is it could have been a rocket."],"Weather Factors":"Windy","Latitude":"27.779736","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Longitude":"-82.63492","Date Submitted":"05/03/2011 12:15 UTC","City":"St Petersburg","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Fireball in the sky over st. petersburg florida","Object Features":"Unknown"}
