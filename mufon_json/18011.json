At the time of the sighting we had been at the beach for a few hours. The sun had set and it was dark but not completely dark. The sky was mostly clear with just a few wispy cirrus clouds and a full moon. We were looking at the night sky in the East Southeast direction of the sky when we noticed a glowing fire red, oblong, cigar shaped object in the sky. We both noticed it at the same time. It was hard to miss. At first we thought it may have been a glowing ember from fireworks but it lasted much longer then a firework would last and also there weren���t fireworks in our general vicinity. It was traveling at a very slow speed in more like a floating fashion. The first thing that I noticed right away was the fact that there was no flashing lights on the object, as all airplanes must have. We could not discern any audible sound from this object. At no time did this object make any erratic moves or deviate from its flight path. It seemed the center of the object had more of a concentrated light then the rest of it. We were able to witness the object glide through the night sky for about ten minutes or so. There were scattered families on the beach and we did not observe anyone else commenting on the object in the sky. When we first noticed the object we were both baffled by it, and tried to identify what it could be and neither of us could draw any conclusions. I have never witnessed an object flying in the sky that did not make a sound. I grew up in the flight path of a major Airport in NY and was in the Air Force so I am very familiar with the sound of both commercial and Military jets. I was able to take three pictures of the object. Two of the pictures I took depict the object as a red ball but the third picture more closely resembles what we actually witnessed. It was very hard to focus on it due to the minimal light at the time. After about ten minutes the object either disappeared from our line of site or just disappeared. The reason I am submitting this report was due to the fact that I read an article online with a video of the same one that we may have witnessed in the examiner.com and felt compelled to tell my story."],"Case Number":"18011","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 08:50 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18011.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18011_submitter_file1__DSC02231.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18011_submitter_file2__DSC02232.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18011_submitter_file3__DSC02233.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18011.html"],"Summary":"Witnessed a glowing red cylinder/cigar shaped object"}
