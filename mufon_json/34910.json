As we started to stop the vehicle object then took off one direction and then changed direction at a very fast pace. When it changed direction it stayed at an angle and then slowed down speed and stayed moving above treeline. We then arrived at a friends house where another friend of ours came along with us to see if we could get another sighting. The last sighting we saw approx. an hour to two hours later was three objects in the sky with a formation that looked like Orions Belt and then they split off in opposite directions."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34910.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34910_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34910_submitter_file2__ufo1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34910_submitter_file3__ufo3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34910.html"],"Country":"United States"}
