I at first thought it might be a shooting star but it was silver witha haze around it. It was about the size of a large star in comparison. I didn't know what to think as It seemed to be moving very fast and seemed to be bobbing up and down as it moved. It made no sound and did not have a tail and it just disapeared."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Case Number":"16610","Latitude":"33.915278","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-98.489067","Date Submitted":"04/20/2009 09:30 UTC"}
