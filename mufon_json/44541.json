I kept telling myself I could not be seeing this but sure enough I followed it in a straightline until I could no longer see it. It was black or grey very dark, had no light or sound. And from what I could see it appeared to have some sort of circle pattern on the outside of the object. It was a very odd experience that I could not rationalize in my head."],"Case Number":"44541","Date Submitted":"12/14/2012 07:33 UTC","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Allentown","There were no other sightings in Allentown on or around December 13th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Allentown","Date of the Event":"12/13/2012 10:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
