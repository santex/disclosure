I stepped away to have a cigarette, and wandered away from where the ambulance was. I was smoking and looking up at the stars. The San Leandro Hills are the background with the sun getting ready to rise, the sky was begining to change colors. I though I noticed a star moving, I looked at another bright star in the general area and confirmed that it was in deed moving. It was moving at a slow pace I thought it was a satellite, then it changed direction from south to east which was odd. We finished up and were leaving the area, I took one last glance at it and it looked as if the object was descending behind the hills. There were two airplanes in the sky at the time both were headed southward behind where the object was located."],"Date Submitted":"02/16/2011 05:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in San Leandro","There were no other sightings in San Leandro on or around February 9th 2011"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"27859","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.73356,+-122.152057(27859)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27859) map </A>","Region":"California","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/09/2011 05:25 UTC"}
