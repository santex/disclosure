He was strolling along the beach with his girlfriend at night when he suddenly saw this object hovering over some electromagnetic generators. Out of fear he hid with his girlfriend behind a tree. There are 2 strange things concerning this event. At first both of them had no recollection of the event the next day. My fellow worker remembered the event when he accidentaly run across an article in a magazine while waiting in his dentist's lounge many years later. This phenomenon of \"missing time\" is common if I'm not mistaken to U.F.O. witnesses. By the way, there were other people who saw the \"object\" that same night. The second strange thing is that after the event the generators started to malfunction and eventually had to be replaced with new ones. This can be explained if we assume that once inside the earth's atmosphere U.F.O.s use aeromagnetodynamics in order to move around. That's it. End of story. I'm sorry I can't be more detailed but that's all the information I have. Thank you for taking the time to read this."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Spetses","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"01/10/2009 02:37 UTC"}
