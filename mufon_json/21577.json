The lights were in a row and there was probably 6-8 of them and they were white. It was flying within 50-60 feet above the ground and no noise was herd. It was headed on a South-East trajectory, when, it made a u-turn and headed North-East until I lost sight of it in the tree line. I have NEVER seen an aircraft make such a sharp turn at such a low speed. It was probably traveling 40-60 mph. I couldnt make out the shape of this vehicle, but the lights were in a row both in the front and back."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/21/2010 08:35 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"21577","Log Number":"US-01212010-0009","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","City":"Fort Worth","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around January 21st 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21577.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21577.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.728999,+-97.31428(21577)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21577) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"32.728999","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax"}
