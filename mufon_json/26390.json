It was cloudy but the object was visible behind the clouds, as it was bright. It appeared to be fairly low in altitude. The object was pulsing, though it wasn't that obvious. Object moved east towards culver for a short distance then became stationary for the next 5 minutes or so. Disappeared suddenly. Very bright and was definitely not a normal aircraft. At first I thought it was a large meteorite....but it was devoid of a tail and wasn't moving fast enough. The timescale and ability to remain stationary ended that idea. We were all calm but curious. Was the first object I've ever seen"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"26390","Longitude":"-86.413575","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Region":"Indiana","City":"Culver","Date of the Event":"11/05/2010 08:20 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/05/2010 10:16 UTC","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Culver","There were no other sightings in Culver on or around November 5th 2010"],"Latitude":"41.219212","Summary":"Bright orange ball showed up south of the 17 and 23 intersection.
