My wife and I were standing outside in our driveway. I was talking to my brother on a cordless phone when my wife said, \"Look up���what is that?\" In complete amazement, I observed a dull charcoal-colored object in the sky moving slowly from north to south almost directly overhead. It was sort of like an odd parallelogram and was utterly silent. Neither of us could determine what its flying altitude was, so it was difficult to accurately judge it's size. But we both agreed that if it was relatively low, then it was absolutely huge���and if it up very high, then it was incredibly huge! My wife and I watched in awe and wonder for about 30-40 seconds before she ran into the house to get a pair of binoculars to try to get a better look at the object. She was gone a little over a minute. During that time, I continued watching the object as it slowly traversed the sky while relating what I saw to my brother on the phone. By the time my wife got back with the binoculars, the object had flown directly south and disappeared behind a neighbor's house."],"Date of the Event":"11/15/1998 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"46798","Summary":"VERY LARGE NON-REFLECTIVE CHARCOAL-COLORED OBJECT OBSERVED IN SKY MOVING FROM NORTH TO SOUTH","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46798.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46798.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/16/2013 03:13 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.036795,+-80.180364(46798)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46798) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.180364","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Hollywood","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Hollywood","There were no other sightings in Hollywood on or around November 15th 1998"],"Latitude":"26.036795","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Region":"Florida","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
