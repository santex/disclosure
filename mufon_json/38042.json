{"Date of the Event":"05/09/2012 09:50 UTC","Case Number":"38042","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were driveing East down M-65. We saw a flash of light, Followed by another flash and another. Then a fourth flash appeared as the first flash disapeared. The last Flash consisted of at least 4 lights. The flashes appeared withing a ten degree length of sky and flashed form the north towards the south. We pulled over to the closed gas station (no lights) to look at the sky as soon as we saw this. We saw no more lights but we did hear a roaring sound. We saw no more lights after this but the roar lasted a good minute or two then faded rapidly. (SIDE NOTE) Out of the corner of my eye I saw a light appear and then dispear to the south very small and dull, probablly no importance. Miles away Another family member heard explosions that woke her dog at the exact same time."],"City":"Tawas City","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Michigan","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Tawas City","There were 4 other sightings in Tawas City on or around May 9th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Fireball","Longitude":"-83.619041","Log Number":"US-05092012-0024","Date Submitted":"05/09/2012 11:24 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38042.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38042.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.279978,+-83.619041(38042)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38042) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"A line of lights","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Latitude":"44.279978"}
