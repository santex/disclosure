I also Knew it was not an airplane of any sort as it was hovering in one spot. I pulled into my driveway, got out of my car with my iphone to take a photo. It was still hovering in one spot. I took a photo of it and watched it for about another minute. Suddenly it streaked across the sky Northbound and disappeared from my view. Judging the distance it was a way from me, which was probably a few miles.....I am quite sure it jetted away at thousands of MPH. When I first observed the object I thought it might have been a balloon or something....then I felt strangely about the object. After it had jetted away I felt a little excited and a little scared. I had never really believed in UFO hype before. Now I believe our technology has increased by leaps and bounds or there are extraterrestrials."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"hovered for about 2 minutes then abruptly like a bullet headed North","Log Number":"US-09272013-0008","Date Submitted":"09/27/2013 09:54 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"09/26/2013 07:05 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Longitude":"-117.474537","Case Number":"51117","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Riverside","There were no other sightings in Riverside on or around September 26th 2013"],"City":"Riverside"}
