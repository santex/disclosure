Getting out of the passenger side I looked up and seen a very odd cloud just sitting off to the n.w. from where I live. The cloud had a glow behind it and my sister said it was just the moon but it was down already below the horizon. So what was it I thought? I stood there in my driveway in awe as the silvery greenish cloud disapated and a large cylinder appeared. ( if you held a AA battery between your thumb and index finger, stretch your hand full length, and viewed it as if it were above you with one eye) Aprox. size and it was about 900m to a mile up. It didn't do anything but my sister noticed a red orb flying about in the clouds and entering it. She went in side after that. I stood there and watch the red orb exit it from the bottom center of the cylinder. It went in the smoke that comes out of the smoke stack that was heading east that night. I seen the orb fly around for a bit then head back to the cylinder and a greenish, silvery cloud manafieisted around it. It was going all green went it cleared up and it was gone. It had just vanished!"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"cylinder shaped, huge, had a red orb leave and return, clear night","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"CA-10042012-0019","Longitude":"-98.807276","Object Features":"Other","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Case Number":"43030","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Region":"Manitoba","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/15/2005 11:40 UTC","Country":"Canada","Latitude":"53.765301","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43030.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43030.html"]}
