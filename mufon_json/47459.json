It is pretty low flying and moving quite slow. I couldn't make out much detail since it was dark but it was large and triangular and even darker against the sky. It made no noise and produced no light. I stood there watching it for at least a minute as it curved smoothly through the sky above my house until I could no longer see it. At first I thought it might be a kite because I thought I heard people in the field near my house but it kept moving. So, then I thought a bird but it made no motion to move it's wings and was far too big."],"Log Number":"US-05172013-0006","Date Submitted":"05/17/2013 02:44 UTC"}
