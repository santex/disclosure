Noticed movement through top window of Jeep. Clear night, relatively no clouds at approx 8:15 pm. 4 translucent lights moved in a circle as if chasing each other about 2x then all 4 met in the middle one by one then dispersed back into circular chasing. Husband and I watched until we drove out of sight. Approx 6-8 months ago witnessed similar sighting facing towards Delphos area. That sighting was one light traveling in a circle for 2 hours. The lights in both were translucent and could see the clouds behind them and look projected from above the clouds but was not an advertising light. I am curious and kind of scared due to there being no explanation for either sighting."],"Date of the Event":"10/12/2013 08:15 UTC","City":"Lima","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Lima","There were no other sightings in Lima on or around October 12th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Region":"Ohio","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51522.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51522.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-84.128026","Case Number":"51522","Summary":"4 translucent lights spun counter clockwise then one by one would meet in the middle then spread back out.
