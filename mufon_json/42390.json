It made no change in direction that I could see and pasted over a tree line out of sight. I'm not good with distance it didn't seem to be very high in the sky. Not as high as a plane so I'm not sure what it was. I just wanted to put this out there incase anyone else seem something."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"42390","Log Number":"US-09082012-0016"}
