Observed from my car while driving south from Payson, AZ. to Phoenix, AZ on highway 87 at mile marker 221. It appeared due south of us. It appeared to us to be a meteoriod burning up in the atmosphere. Don't know if it burned up completely or some contacted the ground. It just disappeared after 3 or 4 seconds. Couldn't see a smoke trail because it was dark. We were awe struck to see such a bright fireball. I have only found one other report of this fireball. It's on this site."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24885.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24885.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around July 21st 2010"],"Summary":"Fireball, east to west, low angle, north of Phoenix Arizona, July 21, 2010.","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"08/01/2010 02:54 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball","Longitude":"-112.072337","Date of the Event":"07/21/2010 10:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.457727","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.457727,+-112.072337(24885)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24885) map </A>","Region":"Arizona","City":"Phoenix","Country":"United States","Case Number":"24885"}
