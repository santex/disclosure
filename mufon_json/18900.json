Driving along, up in the sky I noticed a very bright ball, bigger than the stars. It was blinking a bit, like a plane at night, but I couldn't make out any shape, and it didn't appear to be moving. As the truck got closer, there was a moment where the object went out of sight, and I looked out the back window hoping to get a better view, but it was gone. It must have disappeared when it went out of sight over the truck, so I didn't see how it disappeared. No one else appeared to notice it, and I didn't give the object much thought until it disappeared. By then, I felt weird mentioning it, so I just kept quiet. When I arrived home, there was another bright flash in the sky like a beam of light, and that is the extent of my sighting."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.356461,+-73.284876(18900)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18900) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.356461"}
