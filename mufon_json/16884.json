I am always looking up in the sky. As soon as I looked up I saw a bright orange object traveling across the sky. As soon as I noticed it....I mean as soon as I ran back into the house to get a camera, it switched coarse. But it switched coarse quite smoothly. Not abrupt or 90 degrees or anything. More like 35 degrees. It almost seemed to notice that I noticed it and it and it changed its coarse imediately and then disapeared behind some clouds that were above the Bitteroot Range. I don't know enough about light vs. distance, and trying to equate speed accordingly. But I spen a lot of time looking up at the sky and I have no clue what on earth this was that I saw."],"Date Submitted":"05/11/2009 09:58 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Salmon","There were no other sightings in Salmon on or around May 11th 2009"],"Latitude":"45.184325","Summary":"Steady, constant orange light, traveled fast, switched direction smoothly, no-sound.","Date of the Event":"05/11/2009 09:58 UTC","Longitude":"-113.893681","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Idaho","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.184325,+-113.893681(16884)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16884) map </A>","Case Number":"16884","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
