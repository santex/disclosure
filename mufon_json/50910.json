I was driving west down Highland Avenue in Fort Thomas, KY when I saw a hovering white orb high in the sky; suddenly it spit out another white orb around the same size or a little smaller. The second orb descended at an angle while I was driving. I pulled over to observe, and the second orb stopped its descent. I began to drive again and noticed a third white orb in the southwestern sky. I turned onto Route 27 N and saw two more white orbs floating over the hill from the west. I dropped off the car and got in my husband's car. I asked him if he had seen anything, but he only laughed and said that he had seen five deer. We were going the opposite direction on our way home, and so I was not able to see the orbs. I was a little nervous upon seeing the ejected orb and curious as to why it stopped descending when I pulled over. I was also a bit astounded to see the two orbs coming over the hill. I have had many observations over the summer but have not had time to report them all. I will try to get those reports in as soon as I can."],"Source":"MUFON"}
