She said that she was getting out of the car when a very luminous object traveling north was spotted going very slow. She said it was more luminous than any comet she had ever seen, but explained that the characteristics of it fit that of a usual comet. The one irregularity in the object was the fact that she said it appeared to be 'sparking' and the fact that it's magnitude was so far above any comet she has ever witnessed. Both her and I have gone to watch comets as well as seen them on random occasions fairly frequently - so she has seen a decent amount. I'd be interested to see if anyone else locally or elsewhere saw anything similar, perhaps they could offer a more detailed description then she was able to."],"Region":"Florida","Longitude":"-81.507144","Log Number":"US-02172008-0002","Date of the Event":"02/16/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"9613","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.669637","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9613.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9613.html"],"Summary":"Some form of meteor?"}
