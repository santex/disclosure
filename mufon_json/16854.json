We live in Hatfield, PA. One night we observed it for at least a half hour or more. It was not there the next night so it's not a star. It barely moves so it's not a plane. It looks like a bright star but when looked at closely, it looks like it has multi-colored lights flickering as if you are watching a glowing crystal. The exact date and time - I do not remember"],"Date Submitted":"08/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were 2 other sightings in Philadelphia on or around August 1st 2008"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.954085,+-75.158189(16854)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16854) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16854.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16854.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
