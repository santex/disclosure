(another words 3x the first orange balls original size. the orange single ball then moved from left to right back once again into the white cloud and you could see it stop within the cloud as the orange glow grew fainter and smaller until it finally disappeared in about 30 seconds from moving into the cloud. once the orange ball was extinguished the white illuminated cloud began to shrink horizontally. (both cloud ends shrinking to the clouds center.) the cloud was losing it's bright white glow and was dimming as it took on the same dark grey color as their surrounding clouds. in about 3 minutes the cloud was completely gone from the sky. there was nothing left that i could see in the location the cloud dissipated from. the storm cloud to the south still continued to rain and lightening. it was just spectacular to see. i really and truly think it was a ufo or a group of them. a light doesn't leave a cloud and then turn abruptly around and go back into the same cloud. it never lowered it's altitude. it maintained it's altitude the entire time and would move in and out of the illuminated white cloud."],"Latitude":"33.37467","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date of the Event":"08/17/2013 02:30 UTC","Case Number":"49992","Summary":"Fireball emerged from cloud and split into 3 orange balls that rotated and rejoined.","Date Submitted":"08/19/2013 04:26 UTC","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-112.578177","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Arizona","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08192013-0006","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49992.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49992.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.37467,+-112.578177(49992)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49992) map </A>","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Buckeye","There were no other sightings in Buckeye on or around August 17th 2013"]}
