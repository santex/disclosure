When I went outside, they were barking and howling toward the Dublin area. I know this for a fact because I work in Dublin at Three Oaks Retirement Center. I went outside with a flashlight and a pistol to check on them because I live in the country at Lake Proctor. I looked around to see if there were any stray animals that they might bark at and that is when I saw the lights. They were moving at a very fast pace. I thought that it might be military jets in formation because of all the lights, funny thin though, there were no noise coming from all of them. I watched until they were gone and I looked down and both dogs were gone. When I got back to the house both of them were hiding under my Sports-Trac like they were scared to death."],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas"}
