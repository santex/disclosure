Its has bright lights and moves forwards and sideways at once. When it approached my house the lights shut off immediately to show a triangle shape with blue and red lights on each point. The first time I saw this the monday before but around 5:45am and that time it disappeared quickly and made no sounds. This time it went over the house slowly and had a very low rumbling sound that did not sound like any plane I have heard and about 5 minutes later after the object was no longer in sight several helicopters followed in the same path."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Triangle with large lights that shut off when approached house and had 3 lights to show triangle shape","Case Number":"13778","Log Number":"US-11172008-0021","Longitude":"-87.038018","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Triangle","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Milton","There were no other sightings in Milton on or around November 17th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.640755,+-87.038018(13778)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13778) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/17/2008 06:35 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13778.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13778.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida"}
