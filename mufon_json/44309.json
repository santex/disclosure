On the cell phone. Looked up in the night sky and saw 5 bright orange orbs in a tight but random formation. There was a thick marine layer (fog) about 200 feet up, and they were on the edge of the fog. Two of them were dimmer, presumably because they were deeper in the fog. They were circle about each other, but staying in the same area, so hovering but moving. No sound. I hear helecopers that get that close. It would have been very dangerous for helecopters to be doing that in the fog and darkness. The only color was orange, no gree or red lights. Each object was solid orange light. I ran inside to get the wife, came back out and they were gone. We saw one singular orange orb in the distance moving south. Presumably they were moving north to south. Heart still pounding."],"City":"La Jolla","trends":["There have been no other sightings in La Jolla","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-12032012-0010","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"44309","Summary":"5 bright orange orbs, three most bright, soundless, all in a compact area slowly and randomly moving around each other.
