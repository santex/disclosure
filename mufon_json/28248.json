As we talked, we both witnessed what appeared to be a flaming piece of debris fall from the sky to some fields just outside of Hanover. She claims it was a greenish color, while I saw it as being a yellow. We didn't see its exact landing site, but we were curious as to what it was. We could see a slight smoke trail left behind by it for a few minutes after, but we couldn't quite make out exactly where it landed. We never found an impact site, nor did we even hear it land, but for about an hour afterwards, we saw several planes and helicopters apparently circling the area it landed at. We put off reporting it for a week or so, to see if anything was in the news, but nothing was said. We haven't found anyone else who reported seeing it, nor have we been contacted by any news stations we asked."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Hanover","Date Submitted":"03/16/2011 05:05 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other","Longitude":"-76.983036","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Case Number":"28248","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hanover","There were no other sightings in Hanover on or around March 1st 2011"]}
