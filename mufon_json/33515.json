{"trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There were no other sightings in Miami on or around November 19th 2011"],"City":"Miami","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in the back seat of a car traveling on the 826 expressway in Miami,Fl. Night had just fallen. As i looked out the window i observed 4 lights in a triangle like formation hovering about a mile away at low altitude. As soon as i saw it i realized they were not airplanes beacause they were stationary and had no blinking red or blue lights. The objects suddenly disappered and reappeared in a different formation. They did this several times. It was amazing to watch. As we exited the freeway we pulled over to get a better view. After a few minutes the objects vanished and i saw a small plane circleling the area. I noticed there was a similar incident in Miami just days earlier posted on youtube."],"Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"11/21/2011 12:21 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33515.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Longitude":"-80.32468","Log Number":"US-11212011-0002","Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"11/19/2011 06:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"33515","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.747894,+-80.32468(33515)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33515) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"amazing sighting over miami november 19, 2011","Latitude":"25.747894"}
