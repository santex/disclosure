We turned around and witnessed a circular object in the sky with pulsing lights. My sister immediatly told me to run so we did. I only had eye contact with the object for a few seconds before we both ran to our house which was maybe 150ft away from where we were at the moment. I only recall feeling scared and confused. I never looked back to see if the object was still there so what it did next I can't say."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31427.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31427.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval, Unknown","Latitude":"31.660358","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.470338","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Date Submitted":"09/02/2011 10:55 UTC","Log Number":"US-09022011-0028","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/20/2000 08:00 UTC","City":"Valley Mills","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
