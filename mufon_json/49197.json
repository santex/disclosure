She was getting something from her car which was parked in the street. I looked over at her and noticed a bright orange like light with a trail behind it. It was streaking across the sky and seemed very large or low. At first I thought it was an airplane or jet. I told her to look at it and we both staired at it for a few seconds and realized there was no sound at all. I had my Canon T2I with me so I took multiple shots of it. It was going very fast. I ran inside my house to grab my father and go out the back to see it. By the time we got back there it was gone."],"Object Shape":"Triangle, Unknown","City":"Slidell","Region":"Louisiana","Date of the Event":"02/21/2013 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49197.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49197.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"30.290366","Log Number":"US-07262013-0007","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Slidell","There were no other sightings in Slidell on or around February 21st 2013"],"Summary":"Object flew with no sound and had a glowing trail.
