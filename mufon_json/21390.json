Within that void a large X of light appeared. That X started to spin, and as it spun a lit cloud tube extended from the place where the void across the sky to the right of the point of origin. At the point where the black void started and where the tube started a tiny blip of light came out, which moved out a distance from the point of origin and then disappeared. The tube started to fade, but continued to seem un-naturally lit for about 3 minutes as it shortened. It did not flow away like a cloud, the sky was perfectly clear and this appeared to be way above the atmosphere. It had entirely disappeared within 5 minutes."],"Date Submitted":"01/07/2010 05:58 UTC","Log Number":"US-01072010-0012","Latitude":"35.4762","City":"Oklahoma City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.4762,+-97.510408(21390)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21390) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21390.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21390.html"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"wormhole ufo?","Object Shape":"Chevron, Circle, Cross, Star-like, Other"}
