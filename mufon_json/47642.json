At this point, I noticed a star light object (slightly bigger then a star moving in the night sky along a directed path. It this point in time I was convinced that the object was a satellite. The strange part was that the object got bigger as it appeared that the object was getting closer. The object then got fainter. The object was moving along a definite trajactory, the object got closer then fainter as if the object was moving towards me then away from me. As there are planes in the sky at night, the object was from 100,000 feet to about 30,000 feet (when it got closer) (using planes as a reference to judge the distance). The whole duration of the event lasted about 15 seconds. As it was very far away and it was at night I could not make out any structure. When I was observing the event I was convinced it was a satellite, but the movement of the object towards me and away from me, made the event strange."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47642.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47642.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/18/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/26/2013 08:02 UTC"}
