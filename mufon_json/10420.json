They presented themselves a few minutes before the boom. I ran into the house to see if my boyfriend was ok and I was terrified after what I just observed. My first impression was that something crashed or was shot down because I could hear heavy plane traffic and heavy activity of these amber colored lights. As I was walking back to my back door, i could see off to the west of me in the middle of a field some glowing amber orange lights slowly approaching my position and while i was observing, they put out a beautiful display of sequencing light display and little balls of deep amber projecting off one of them. I was afraid but I captured on camcorde and Mufon was contacted and are analizing my tape at present.The night after I camcorde another similar display and I contacted our local Mufon rep."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.491087,+-86.126503(10420)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10420) map </A>","Date Submitted":"04/15/2008 10:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-04192008-0008","Case Number":"10420","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.126503","Summary":"Camcorded event before and after boom","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Kokomo","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None"}
