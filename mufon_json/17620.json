At first I though it was a police helicopter hovering over downtown because of the intensity of the light, but as I began to drive that direction home I could tell that the light was further to the east than I thought. When I got home I went out to my balcony and took these photographs and video. The light didn't move from its position for over 2 hours until just as the sun was coming up. It then slowly moved up and to the south which negates the possibility of the light being a celestial body of some sort. There is a military base to the east of Denver, but DIA (the airport) is out in that direction as well so the light couldn't have gone unnoticed."],"Case Number":"17620","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-104.976853","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There was one other sighting in Denver on or around June 22nd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
