As I focused, I realized there were 3 orbs in triangle formation traveling north. They descended slightly bending east. The front orb split into two and then all 4 abrubtly turned northwest traveling at an unimaginable speed over the horizon. They were yellow glowing orbs, very bright. There was also not a sound from the objects and the night sky was almost completely clear that night. I immediately called my friend that I had just been talking to 15 minutes prior and asked him if he had \"just saw that!\" His response, \"you saw it too?!?\" I asked him to explain when and what he saw before I told him what I saw. He said it was about 5 minutes ago (3-4 mins before mine, He lived just southwest of me a few miles away) and it was a \"tear drop\" that \"dripped.\" He said he turned around to get another friend to look up, but by the time they looked back up it had disappeared."],"Date Submitted":"03/01/2012 07:04 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-81.301875","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"02/16/2012 11:37 UTC","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in De Bary","There were no other sightings in De Bary on or around February 16th 2012"],"Summary":"4 Glowing Orbs Travel North Over Central Florida","Tags":"City","Case Number":"36190"}
