I was out looking for my cat. I was admiring the stars when I noticed a bright light wavering. I thought it might be a plane, but it was silent, and did not have any blinking lights. It stayed in sight for about 10-minutes, and moved very slowly right then left; up and down slightly. It was larger and brighter than any of the stars. It eventually disappeared behind some clouds. The same thing appeared about 2-weeks later, \"hubby\" witnessed. October 8, 2007."],"Latitude":"38.965401","Longitude":"-122.619223","Summary":"Not Provided"}
