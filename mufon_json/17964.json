In those days, commercial costumes were not available; so my mom made mine on her sewing machine from a pattern purchased locally: a bunny rabbit with long drooping ears. All of the houses in our neighborhood averaged about 100' from the street, and all had a walkway from the sidewalk to their stoop or front porch. I would walk up to the front door while my dad waited for me on the sidewalk parallel to the street. Imagine my fear at six years old when I turned around to walk back down to the street, and my father wasn't there. Initially, panic overtook me until I spotted my dad in the middle of the street about one house down from the house where I had collected my candy. Running towards him, I noticed he was looking up at the sky. I looked, too; and saw a perfect circle of rotating colored lights moving south to north. Based on my memory, this UFO was about 500' in altitude and moving about 125-150 MPH. The only other person we related this event to was my mother; and oddly enough, we never again talked about it amongst ourselves."],"Latitude":"34.228436","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Wilmington","Date of the Event":"10/31/1952 06:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/31/1952 06:00 UTC"}
