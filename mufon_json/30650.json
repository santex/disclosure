The night was suprisingly starry. The UFO appered as a star. The UFO was about the size of a golf ball from my point of view. The UFO was to the right of the moon about two fist sizes. It started to move slowly to the left. When it just got past the moon, it bolted to the right and went behind the moon."],"Object Features":"None","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
