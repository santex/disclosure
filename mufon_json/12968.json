The light became brighter for 2 sec then faded out. I thought it was a meteor, but i didnt see any trail or tail like others i seen. It lasted 15 sec. Looking for more i saw another one going south. Same thing a steady light no strobe. Became brighter then fade to nothing. I live 6miles from Luke AFB and know the flight path of sky harbor. These were not planes. There is a bright half moon. The sky was lit up good. not many stars were seen. I dont think it was a satelight. Wonder it there any meteor showers going on?"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12968.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12968.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/08/2008 07:10 UTC","Latitude":"34.054258","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/08/2008 07:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-111.086601","Log Number":"US-10092008-0003","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown"}
