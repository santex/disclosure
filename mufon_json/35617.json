Four or five had a \"grey black uniform unchanging shape in four to five sequential still shots. The others that followed were void. No cloud could block the sun like this. For four seprarate shots without fading away, or changing. This appears solid? I've never seen anything quite like this before. I have video and backup pix to validate this sighting. I believe there are ufo's that surround the sun's orbit!
