My band had just come out of our practice place, and webegan talking, winding down from playing. My bass player then stated, what thehell is that rather calmly. Myself, the other three band members, my wife andtwo children saw three glowing lights, in a triangular formation, above it was atriangular shaped object. It was not illuminated in any way. It also madeabsolutely no sound. The three objects moved in a circle around the object, andat one point moved so abruptly, i thought the object was moving back toward us,but it kept moving away. I at first thought it was a low flying plane, but onceagain, there was dead silence. As the object moved away from us it just kind ofpopped out of sight, it did not pass over and fade away in the distance, it justdisappeared after moving about 100 yards away."]}
