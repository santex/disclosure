I love to occasionally go out on my balcony on a starry night and just sit and look at the stars. This August night I saw two meteors and was just getting ready to go back inside when I saw a round bright white light appear in the sky. I immediately said WOW because I new I had just seen something important. This is the way I explained it to my daughter the next day. I told her it was as if someone had turned on a flashlight in the night sky. The stars would all be the size of pennies and this light I saw was the size of a 50 cent piece next to the stars. It only lasted for about 3 seconds and was gone. I knew it wasn't a plane or helicopter, it was very high up in the sky. The flashlight is the best way to describe it, I kept watching that area for awhile afterwards and saw no moving object. The theory of what I had seen at that moment was that it came out of some portal or dimension and I just happened to get a glimpse of it. Thank you, I hope this was helpful."],"Object Shape":"Circle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12069.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12069.html"],"Longitude":"-94.68103","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Date of the Event":"08/11/2008 03:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.733063,+-94.68103(12069)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12069) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None"}
