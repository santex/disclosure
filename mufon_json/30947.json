I noticed a white ball of light moving out of the west, heading East to southeast a 5:06AM. As the light grew closer, it had a white glow but no other lights on the object. There were no blinking lights as you would see on wings or a tail if it were a plane. When the object got close it disappeared behind some trees directly behind my house. I realized that the object made no noise at all. I could hear traffic from the highway picking up a bit, from about a mile away so I thought it was strange to not hear anything when the white object passed. I first noticed it because it was very bright and there no other objects moving in the sky. I assumed it was a plane."],"Longitude":"-90.408405","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.415139,+-90.408405(30947)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30947) map </A>","Region":"Missouri","Date Submitted":"08/16/2011 02:19 UTC","Case Number":"30947","Log Number":"US-08162011-0013","City":"Imperial","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30947.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30947.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00"}
