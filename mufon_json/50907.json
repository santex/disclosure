My wife was walking our children to school and as she crossed 23rd Street and 8th Avenue in Chelsea she noticed a few people standing at the corner staring and pointing into the sky. At around 2 pm she went back to pick the kids up from school and noticed a larger crowd staring and pointing in the sky saying look at the UFOs. She then called me and told me what was happening and I ran home and got my video camera and went down to 23rd Street and 8th Avenue. When I got there there was a large crowd around 40-60 people standing around, also there were news trucks from ABC news 7 and NY1. What i saw was a large object that was stationary and fading in and out and there were multiple shiny orb shaped objects that were flying by also fading in and out. I was unable to capture the objects on video at 23rd Street and 8th Avenue, so I started to walk towards 24th street and as I looked north east (towards the Empire State Building) i noticed a very bright silver orb and it was flying low it was bobbing up and down and wobbling. It stopped for a few seconds and hovered then shot straight up. I was able to take a video for a few seconds. I did not think i got anything but when i slowed it down you can see the orb flying then when i zoom in alittle you can see that the object is triangle shaped. During the sighting there were people saying that they saw 2 military jets fly over at Hi altitude Also at around 6:30pm all planes were diverted in the area due to a gas leak at the Regional��� Air traffic control center in Westbury , New York that controls the 3 major airports Newark Liberty, LaQuardia and John F.
