I noticed two objects sort of glinting in the sunlight. At first i thought that it was 2 mylar ballons, but they were moving straight across the sky at a steady rate. they travelled one right behind the other and i watched them until the light turned green. This is not the first time I have witnessed something in the sky around Sprngfield that I could not explain. I feel that they obfects were moving to quickly and deliberatly to be balloons blowing in the wind, but I am unable to fathom what they could have been. And since these two objects were flying and I could not identify them, I have no choice but to term them UFO's. I would really like to know if anyone else in my area has reported anything similar.
