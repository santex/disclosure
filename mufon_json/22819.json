are helicopters. which the rotors would have been torn to pieces in the trees. or a harrier jump jet. which makes all kinds of noise. this object\\craft was entirely silent! while on the ground it was orange. it stayed there for what seemed like maybe a minute, or two. while there it pulsed in a slowed ebbing constant rythmn. it then change colors back to the blue. i believe before returning back to the sky to it's old altitude.(no more than 150ft. it seemed like) & zipped directly back the way it came, every bit as fast as it had appeared. i don't believe any of us experienced \"lost time\". none of us were afraid either during, or directly following the event. a very interesting sidebar! it left an indentation where it landed approx. 5ft. in diameter, & 3ft. or so deep. stupidly, we played in this indentation! made it our fort! it was not a \"crater\". no burn\\scorch marks. more like the dirt had just been removed. sidebar #2: seperate from this event, my best friend told me years(3 or 4) after this that he'd seen a saucer above his house(across and a door down from my house.) when we were like 7, or 8. the above event happened when we were approx. 10\\11. he said he'd seen these lights through the curtains in their living roomwhen he gotten up to go to the bathroom, he looked out, and saw this craft floating above the street light at the end of his driveway. he ran to the front door to get a better look, only to not see it. he went outside to fine that it had moved above his house! he said he paniced, & run back in to his bed. he also said he'd had \"nightmares\" about them coming back to get him for year afterwards. it should also be noted that there was a strange blacken circle on the street directly in front of the very light he'd stated the craft was hovering over for years while we were growing up. now the part that makes my skin go creepy. as a teen years after friend #1 had told me of his experience?(now age 15\\16) my other friend and i were talking late one night. out of the blue, with no prompting,or mention from me, he brings up that he too had seen the craft that friend #1 had seen! apparently at the same time, on the same night! friend #2 stated he too had gotten up to go to the bathroom, and saw lights coming through his bathroom window. which faces friend #1's house. he then run to his kitchen, where he said he looked through these luever\\shutter things they had on the inside of the kitchen windows. he told me he saw basically the same craft that friend #1 had described. a saucer with multi-colored strobing\\flashing lights. friend #2 said he too paniced, & run back his bed. so i had two seperate people, that i trust, tell me the same story from each of their own pov's, but they tell me this years apart! independent of each other. with the second not knowing what the first had told me until after he'd told his side of the story! i still know both these gentlemen. but they have families, and i seriously doubt that they'd be willing to step forward. however, i am 100% willing to take as many poly-graph tests as you want me to, to prove to you that everything that i've just re-counted to you did indeed happen to the best of my knowledge just as i described. please e-mail me a response as to if mufon has ever heard of an encounter like the one i described having in \"the weeds\" on april 2nd, around 8:30 pm. i really want to know if anybody else has seen what we all saw that night. thank you for your time & consideration. sincerely, [cms\\tg\\pid]"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Case Number":"22819","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22819.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22819.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Summary":"Silent luminous sphere","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Davenport","There were no other sightings in Davenport on or around April 2nd 1982"],"Date Submitted":"04/14/2010 07:38 UTC","Region":"Iowa","Log Number":"US-04142010-0010","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"04/02/1982 08:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.526724","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","City":"Davenport","Longitude":"-90.573507","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City"}
