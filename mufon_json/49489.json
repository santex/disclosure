(my friend that was driving also saw the lights after i had mentioned something.) these two objects were hovering. the lights began to fade one after another after a good 3 minutes and small violet\\blue objects shot off and headed west in a straight line. the very last violet\\blue light was quickly flying around the other lights. there was no sound, nothing else in the air at the time."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
