(anonymous), whom she knew. she described her emotional state as laughing, crying, scared and excited. there were several men in the garage and she asked them to join her outside to assure her she wasn���t seeing what she thought she was seeing. they all observed a boomerang shaped craft that was up on its side between the garage and the trees adjacent to the garage. she couldn���t estimate its size but said that it was almost as long as the garage in height. there was a pattern on the craft that she couldn���t reproduce exactly. the silent object moved slowly behind the garage. orange and yellow steady lights lined the front edge of the boomerang. the witness and her friend returned to her car and proceeded east on route 104. they observed the craft which seemed to pace her vehicle the witness stated that when they arrived at their destination they were excited, happy and scared. her son, who was normally outgoing and active, sat quietly on the couch. the witness���s father went outside to attempt to observe the craft but it was no longer in sight. the gospel singers had completed their practice and were preparing to leave. the witness guessed that she arrived at her parents��� home least an hour later than expected. the witness���s eyes were burning pressure and pain about a week later. both witnesses would occasionally experience this strange tingling between their eyebrows, which signaled them that a ufo was nearby. they drove to the sensed location and observed ufos on several occasions. they saw a light (like the one on i-93 and the boomerang) moving above the lake. it was never as large as the ones in their first sighting. orange, white, blue and maybe green. they could go up, down, sideways, zigzagging, moved away at an incredibly fast rate, almost as if it had turned its lights out. the witness stated that she and her friend often experienced a tingling sensation between their eyebrows after the ufo encounter and ���sensed��� that they should drive to a designated location to observe a ufo. they complied with this sensory input and observed what she described as 20-30 ufo sightings over a two year period. on one occasion her mother videotaped the ufo but her grandmother accidently taped over it, she stated. at night she sometimes would feel this sensation like they���re coming and felt that they were coming before she went to bed at night.��� she felt that they could come through walls. witness reported that she hadn���t read any books and had never heard that they could pass through walls. she recalls the sensation of someone in her bedroom but does not recall observing anyone. she said it was the feeling of getting a physical from a doctor. she could see shadows a lot of big black eyes all around her and touching her. she felt like she was suspended in the air. she would feel like she didn���t like it and wanted to go back home. this would frighten her and she would remain awake for a while. she would have these flashes of memory when she woke up in the morning. she has considered hypnosis and stated that she would like to know, but at the same time doesn���t want to know. the witness���s friend m----- remarried and moved to england. i have emailed an inquiry to her but have not received a reply. l----- informed me that m----- intends to respond to my inquiry, so i am waiting to hear from her. the garage owner refuses to discuss his ufo observation. he suffered criticism and humiliation following the newspaper publicity and wants to ���forget about it.��� additionally, he is caring for his aged wife and wants to be left alone. i traveled to laconia, nh���s library and spent the day researching its newspaper archives for september 15, 1978-march 31, 1979 and september 15, 1979-march 31, 1980. it was a 150 mile round trip journey. i wasn���t able to locate the ufo sighting report. i have researched the mufon, nuforc and nicap archives and have not been able to locate this sighting report. my investigation is temporarily on hold until i receive more precise information from the witness or a reply from her friend in england."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Cone, Disc","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.527855,+-71.470351(11253)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11253) map </A>","Region":"New Hampshire","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11253.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11253.html"]}
