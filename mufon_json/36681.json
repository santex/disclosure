The lights went north and south seeming to almost become one and then shoot in another direction away from other light. This has happened for the last three nights. They seemed to be flying over the Columbia river from Wallula jct. to the Snake river. This lasted for over two hours and we called another person whom lived at a higher location in the area, they witnessed 4 red flashing lights. From our location we could only see 3 at any given time. I know these are not planes because what plane would go back and forth? There was many trains that go by and when the train came thru area the lights seemed to be further away. And after train passing the noise in area became silent. These lights had no sound."],"Date of the Event":"03/23/2012 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Finley","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03232012-0011","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Washington","Tags":"City","Case Number":"36681","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Finley","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36681.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36681.html"],"Sighting Duration":"02:00:00"}
