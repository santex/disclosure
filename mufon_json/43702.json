I happened to look up over the top of my house (we were in my back yard looking toward front yard) I noticed a bright shiny object in the sky moving very slow going North to South, I am in the flight path of the Sarasota Airport so I see planes of all kinds pass over for the past 30 yrs. I have lived in this house.. This object was DIFFERENT !! No sound moving very slow and seemed very bright in the sky. I said to my son \" Look at that thing in the sky \" What is it ?He right away said MOM it's a plane.. I then said it's LOW and we should hear sound and it's to shiny for a plane . he then kept looking and said I do not know WHAT that is .. I ran and got my camera and my son took a pic just before it went behind a cloud , I ran to the front of my house and never saw it come out of the cloud. I have never contacted you before but this just seemed so strange to me, I felt compelled to contact you. Thank you"],"Date Submitted":"11/04/2012 07:47 UTC"}
