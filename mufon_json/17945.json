Our location was eggharbor and greentree rds. I was in our truck as a passenger, we were waiting for traffic to clear so we could enter the shopping plaza. I saw a reddish orange object gliding across the sky, facing SE from my right to left. It seemed to flicker. It would brighten and dim speed up then slow. I watched it for about 2-5 minutes and lost sight of it suddenly. I pointed it out to my husband but later when all the other reports came in I asked him and apparently he brushed it off. I have reported before and just wanted to let MUFON know I witnessed the object in this location and time. Hope they can track the path of the incidents on that night. Like many other people who watch the sky and see UFO's I can't seem to stop watching and reporting hoping someone has seen the same. I am not crazy as some people think . I just pay attention."],"Log Number":"US-07082009-0017","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"red/orange object","Region":"New Jersey"}
