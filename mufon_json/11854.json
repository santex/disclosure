{"Latitude":"41.887904","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking my dog out to pee in the backyard before I went to bed, when I noticed a couple of star-like objects moving across my house(the altitude was way high). Then I just noticed more of them coming from the south in formation(making no sound)....most of the formations looked liked V's. Then after 20 so minutes of watching them they stopped coming from the south and got out of my sight. The objects were way to high to take a picture sadly. After all this I just feel really excited at the moment."],"Date Submitted":"08/01/2008 12:10 UTC","Disposition":"Hoax","Summary":"Saw hundreds of Ufos that looked like stars in formation moving.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"08/01/2008 12:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11854.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11854.html"],"Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08012008-0004","Case Number":"11854","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.887904,+-87.620328(11854)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11854) map </A>","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were 4 other sightings in Chicago on or around August 1st 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Chicago","Longitude":"-87.620328","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
