{"Longitude":"-117.285076","Case Number":"26515","City":"Victorville","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving north from Victorville, CA. At 7:30pm me and my wife witnessed 24 red lights in the distance near Dale Evans exit, then drifted slowly over the I-15 and went behind a mountain and dissappeared. Also lights went slowly from red to white. When I first saw it I thought it was helicopters flying in formation at least five to 8 miles away, but when it got closer it was massive and moved silently and slowly. I was in utter disbelief. I still don't know what it was."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/11/2010 11:47 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/11/2010 07:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26515.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26515.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Summary":"Possibly saucer like, very black, 4 red lights, at least 0.2 miles long, approximately 150 to 100 feet,","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Victorville","There were no other sightings in Victorville on or around November 11th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-11112010-0014","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.544347,+-117.285076(26515)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26515) map </A>","Latitude":"34.544347"}
