{"divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and i were driving from dulce new mexico to pagosa springs colorado along a dirt road short cut. we came upon 2 horses laying by the side of the dirt road. the horses were dead. i stopped the car, got out and walked up to the horses. i noticed 3 more horses in the field nearby that also appeared to be dead. the two horses by the road side had no legs. their legs were gone from the knees down. the two horses by the road side had no lower jaws. the cheek flesh and muscle was also missing. both ears on both horses by the road were gone. one of the horses in the field appeared to be in the same condition. because of the way the other two horses were laying, i could not see their legs or head due to heavy sage brush. i returned to my car and told my wife there were horses in the field that also looked dead. i told my wife they may have been hit by trucks driving down the road. i told her that perhaps a herd had been crossing the road and were struck by a large truck, thereby severing the legs of some of the animals and destroying their faces. the remaining three horses then staggered into the field and died. we then continued down the road towards our dinner date. after eating dinner, we returned to dulce, nm using the same dirt road short cut. my wife asked me to slow down because we were nearing the place where the horses had been. she did not want me to hit them. as we approached the site, we immediately noticed that the two horses by the road were gone. i could not see into the field to determine if the other 3 horses were there or not because it was dark by then. i slowed to around 5 miles per hour to scan the road side and field as best we could under the dark conditions. my wife then said \"look at that in the sky.\" i leaned down towards her lap to look out her window. i could see a dim white light to the north towards archuleta mesa. the light then began to move south. then the light moved east and then north and passed in front of the nearly full moon. as it passed in front of the moon i could clearly see the shape of the craft. it looked like a long cylindrical...butane tank (but i checked that it looked like a cigar..in the check box there), but really it looked like a long butane tank\\cylinder. it was followed by what i thought were two smaller black objects, almost flying in formation. by now, i was looking out my driver window and over my left shoulder. my wife said \"let's just get out of here.\" so i started to drive again, looking over my shoulder at the object, again just a light because it was not silhouetted against the moon. the object then descended and circled directly behind and above our car. i looked up through our sun roof and saw that the object\\light was right above us and slightly behind us. the last thing i remember is looking through my sunroof at the light. then we were just driving along like nothing had happened. we arrived home shortly after 10:00 pm. and that's significant because our dinner dates only last about 3 hours. we are almost always home by 8:00 or 8:30. but this time we did not arrive home until 10:10 pm. it just does not add up. 1. dirt road driving 2. wife saw it and pointed it out 3. i thought the object was a star 4. cylinder\\cigar\\elongated butane tank, moving and circling our car 5. i felt no emotion. i drove away. confusion while at home after. 6. i don't know how i lost sight of the object."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Region":"New Mexico","Log Number":"US-09172008-0046","Date of the Event":"09/16/2008 07:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Dulce","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"36.933621","Longitude":"-106.998926","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Dulce","There were no other sightings in Dulce on or around September 16th 2008"],"Case Number":"12551","Disposition":"Hoax","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder","Summary":"Horse Mutilation, Possible Human Abduction","Date Submitted":"09/16/2008 07:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12551.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12551.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.933621,+-106.998926(12551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12551) map </A>"}
