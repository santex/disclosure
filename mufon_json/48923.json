We were cooking out behind our house than suddenly it came out of nowhere. 2. We saw a ball of light with a long tail on it. 3. We noticed that it first appeared to be a comet until it stopped suddenly in the sky. 4. It appeared to stop in the sky and split up into 5 separate pod-like structures. The pods slowly moved away from the structure for what appeared to be five minutes than gently moved back towards the center structure. 5. I wondered if it was going to come and hit the ground within a 60 mile range of my house. 6. It disappeared behind the tree line."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-84.259767","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Franklin","There were no other sightings in Franklin on or around July 13th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"48923","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Latitude":"39.526182","Sighting Duration":"00:25:00","Summary":"This object appeared to be a comet but stopped and split into smaller pieces.","Country":"United States","Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.526182,+-84.259767(48923)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48923) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Franklin"}
