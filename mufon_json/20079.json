At around 10:50 AM I was walking down Colorado Blvd. heading to class when I heard the faint noise of a helicopter. I looked up to see a black colored helicopter hovering over campus at a very high altitude. I then noticed toward the north, over the mountains, a bright cylinder shaped object moving slowly in a north-east direction. It clearly had no helicopter blades, or wings. Its movement was not like a balloon either, it would move toward the north-east, then stop and hover completely still, then move again in the same direction, it did this about 4 or 5 times, then as it got farther it faded out of view. Once it was out of view the helicopter then left in a north-west direction, as though it had been observing it."],"Date of the Event":"10/22/2009 10:50 UTC","Log Number":"US-10222009-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20079.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20079.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"bright, cylinder shaped object","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.149265,+-118.138846(20079)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20079) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
