It was very bright and I stared at it for some time assuming it was a really high plane or helicopter, and I would see it moving. At no point did it move so I then stared at it more and decided it must be a very bright star, much brighter than anything I have ever seen before. I stared at it for a good 15 minutes and it looked like a star only much brighter. It had different colors and sparkled the way a star does, maybe a bit more. As stated before it did not move at all in the 15 minutes I was staring at it. At this time I went in and decided to try and find out what star it was. After about 10 minutes I had read that Sirius was the brightest star and decided that was probably what I had been looking at. Went back outside.... and whatever it was, was gone. The only thing that could stay in the sky motionless like that is a helicopter, and I stared at it for a long time and I am possitive it was not a helicopter. I am possitive that I did not loose the star or anything also. Who knows, probably nothing, but it was really creepy. Wondering if anyone else saw this."],"Date of the Event":"08/21/2010 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around August 21st 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25160.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25160.html"],"Case Number":"25160","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08222010-0008","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"08/22/2010 11:53 UTC"}
