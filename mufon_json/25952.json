It remained still for about 10 minutes and began moving very slowly . It had no blinking lights at all and grew larger as if it was getting closer it then started moving more towards the south,when it first appeared it was to the south west.about 15 degrees off the horizon. Then it just stopped as I was looking at it with my night vision monicle I could see what looked like static electric reaching for the tree tops, I know there alot of electric lines in that direction. It was shortly after 8pm and lasted for about 40 minutes . Then it rose a bit and seemed to go away from us very slowly and dissapeared in the distance. Originally it looked to be over the point park area in Riverview or behind and went towards salisbury newbrunswick"],"Case Number":"25952","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"46.099276","Date Submitted":"10/18/2010 10:28 UTC","Region":"New Brunswick","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Dieppe","There were no other sightings in Dieppe on or around October 12th 2010"]}
