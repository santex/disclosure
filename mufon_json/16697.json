i was thinking it was taking quite a while for this show to start when we both suddenly caught sight of an extraordinary v shaped object consisting of 5 round neon green circles flying silently (west to east). it's size was about 100 feet across and about was gliding about 100 feet (or less) above the rooftops of the houses directly across the street from where we were standing and facing. our jaws literally dropped, pearl immediately grabbed for my arm in disbelief as we watched this object return gliding silently away towards the haze in the west. it returned before we could even compose our thoughts, now flying silently and banking slightly towards bakersfield as it traveled east again. it was unconventional in that when viewed from the side it looked to be only several inches in it's thickness if even that, incredibly thin in fact, not having any kind of fuselage or capsule present that could contain even the smallest human being; appearing similar to a long green neon tube in the sky from our perspective. as it banked slightly northeast it appeared as a thin slit of luminescent chartreuse, similar to a green traffic light in color and certainly as vibrant in effect as a traffic light. we watched as it flew away disappearing into a mostly clear sky. we looked at each other shaking our heads and said \"what the hell was that?!\" only a quick moment had passed when this same formation returned again, flying at about the same altitude. heading in the opposite direction now towards the west. this time with it's flight path having moved again (south) and much closer to us spanning the width as it flew over lucard street in front of pearl's house. in hindsight, it might have been conducting a scanning the area, the way that it appeared to be methodically panning back and forth ( from east to west \\ west to east) while moving itself slightly more than it's own width with each passing a little further towards the south. by now the parachutists had started their descent onto the football field, we could hear the crowds in the stands cheering them on as the red smoke flares left their trails behind them in the dusk of the early evening sky. the last time we watched as it silently flew directly over our heads and from underneath this craft i observed what i would call a transparent molecular structure within these five precise lime green circles, the insides of which appeared to be of a kinetic nature, even electrical perhaps. to use a descriptive analogy, it's observable structure reminding me of looking into active cellular structures when viewed through a microscope. at this, my land lady in a state of panic, ran into the house and immediately called the local police station, after which she then contacted the local airport to make a report over the phone. needless to say that the response from both parties she contacted were quick if not ridiculing, to dismiss her concern about the incident. i responded to her attempts to explain to authorities with a smug \"pearl, they don't care and i wouldn't have bothered with that process myself\". i was personally offended at how she was regarded by the authorities and didn't care if anyone ever knew or heard about it. i knew that we had witnessed something extremely unique and completely unnerving. we were both really startled by what we had witnessed over the course of about 7 minutes, perhaps 10 at most. during pearl's conversation with the local authorities and by her reaction from the attitudes given her about her report, i could see that they had made her appear psychologically questionable, perhaps drunk or demented and insecure about what she witnessed. we sure weren't any of those things. i wouldn't have bothered with reporting anything to anyone and i told her that i was not surprised by their attitude. the airport ended the conversation with pearl by telling her that they would contact us should there be any further eyewitness reports or after conferring with the pilots in the air, i believe. \"right\" i thought. interesting however, that this object was actually flying somewhere between the ground and the airplane above that was carrying these parachutist's whom you would have thought might have possibly seen something during their descent towards the field. was it also observed by anyone attending the high school football stadium or field that night? i don't know. in an unfortunate coincidence regarding the same aircraft that was carrying the parachutist's observed performing on that october evening in taft, california, an unfortunate disaster was also to occur a week or so after our ufo sighting: (taken from a report about findings urging ntsb\\faa regulations regarding sport parachuting and flying safety) on october 17, 1982, a military version of a beech d-18 crashed during takeoff near taft, california. the aircraft had 12 sport parachutists on board; none survived. the safety board determined that the airplane had been overloaded with a center of gravity that was well in excess of the aft limit. the board was concerned that the faa was not sufficiently attentive to sport parachuting operations and that the safety of parachutists was jeopardized by companies that didn't operate their airplanes safely. the safety board urged the faa to do a better job of defining its oversight responsibilities for sport parachute aircraft. indeed, this was also the same parachute team that performed the night of our ufo sighting, not to mention that my concepts about what is possible in our reality has been radically transformed ever since this sighting. i believe that the location was a \"hotspot\" for sightings by locals at this time."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/10/1982 09:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Chevron, Circle, Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16697.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16697.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Taft","There were no other sightings in Taft on or around October 10th 1982"]}
