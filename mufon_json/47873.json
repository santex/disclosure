It went in a straight line with no sound and just keep going straight And what seemed like up up up till it was so tiny I couldn't see it anymore. There was one other person outside with me that saw the same thing, then we saw more then normal planes in the sky and also saw one bright white light with no sound as well. I was really excited And I do believe it was a ufo of some sort Both the yellow ball with flames and the bright white light. I wished I had my camera on me so I could have taped it."],"Case Number":"47873","Date Submitted":"06/04/2013 10:31 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in West Paris","There were no other sightings in West Paris on or around June 4th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-70.523079","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47873.html"],"City":"West Paris","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Summary":"Orange Ball with Bight flame of red glowing bright and then light. flew straight and got smaller as it flew away"}
