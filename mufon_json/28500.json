I turned from Torrey Pines Road onto La Jolla Village Road going east. At the next intersection, La Jolla Scenic, there was something hovering over a grove of trees and condos. It was about 100 to 200 feet in the air, had red and blue lights with a few white ones. None of the lights was flashing and they appeared in a triangle shape. Instinctively, I rolled my window down and peered at it as I drove past (there were no other cars on the road). I could not hear anything or feel anything. Once past La Jolla Scenic I was committed to that direction, so I made a right onto the next available street (Villa La Jolla) and drove into a parking lot that was east of the lights. However, I was now down a hill and could just see the lights through the top of the trees."],"Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/30/2011 04:58 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"28500","Date Submitted":"04/01/2011 12:44 UTC","Latitude":"32.847898","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.847898,+-117.249284(28500)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28500) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28500.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28500.html"],"Region":"California","Longitude":"-117.249284","City":"San Diego"}
