One disappeared from view the other flew right in front of an aircraft taking off. We gave chase driving along Dann Road but it was difficult to follow as we got held up at traffic lights and the object was obscured by the tree line. The craft disappeared as if it landed. W e then drove back along Dann Rd to Woodbridge Square. From the FNB Bank we watched the second orange orb float silently overhead. We stood and looked right up into the craft. It was very exciting and was torn between taking my eye of the craft and setting up the video on my cell phone. In the end I managed to get two photos as it disappeared behind Woolworths. As it flew over the building it dimmed a bit and then it lit up again. This was a true case of a unidentified flying object as neither of us had seen anything like it before or imagined a ���flying saucer��� to look like this. It looked a bit like a big orange ball of gaseous jellyfish. On reading another sighting in Park Rynie Natal the lady describes it well: ���it was huge and looked like a hot air balloon without a basket for passengers moving across the sky. It was all lit up from the inside, like a huge candle in a huge balloon.���"],"Country":"South Africa","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Kempton Park","There were no other sightings in Kempton Park on or around May 29th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"Gauteng","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
