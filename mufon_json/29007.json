{"Date Submitted":"05/08/2011 01:13 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy girlfriend and I saw at least 20 UFO's over Pacific MO at 11pm May 7th. We saw them fly in straight lines and would turn unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. They would be moving slow and them stop and then just dart. We also saw one fly right over our house and when it got above us it glowed a bright white. We also saw some kind of aircraft chasing a few of them and even what looked like the aircraft was shooting at it. I saw flashes from the plane in the direction of the UFO. This lasted maybe 30 seconds then the plane flew off. You could see the difference between the UFO's and the planes. We saw many of aircraft fly around the area for quite some time during and after the event. We had at least 5 other people that saw this as well. This took place right around the big dipper at 11pm. I watched the sky till 1am and I would see a UFO every now and again. Please contact for more info. Thanks."],"Summary":"20 plus UFO's and aircraft seen chasing them","Latitude":"38.481998","Region":"Missouri","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Pacific","There were no other sightings in Pacific on or around May 7th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-05082011-0007","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29007.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29007.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-90.741519","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.481998,+-90.741519(29007)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29007) map </A>","Case Number":"29007","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/07/2011 11:00 UTC","City":"Pacific","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
