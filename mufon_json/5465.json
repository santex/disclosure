I was driving twards home at about 5:45 pm today. I was about 10 miles from home on a 25 mile trip. I always look to the sky occasionally to see if I see anything. I have never seen anything in the sky. I am ussually skeptical that I would ever see anything but, why not look. I was driving pretty much north from Kalamazoo. I looked up at this clearing about 10 miles from home and I thought I saw something strange. It looked like, what I would call, a black rainbow. Now, it hasn���t rained here in 2 days so, there should be no rainbow. So, I thought it must be something on the windshield of my 1988 chevy 4WD. I moved my head to the left and to the right. Nope, it was definitely in the sky somehow. Then I noticed, it was perfectly straight. A perfectly straight black rainbow pointing exactly down to the ground where I was heading to. That���s right, it was pointing at my house, 10 miles away. Now to describe this black rainbow. It was following what appeared to be a jet stream. But, it was larger in width than the jet stream. It was probably 8 times as wide as the jet stream, and it continued on farther than the jet stream, in fact it looked as if it went right to the ground, at my house. But, again I was 10 miles away from my house so, who knows. The thing was 8 times as wide as a jet stream, see through, and perfectly straight. A jet stream would be the path of an airplane. This was perfectly straight and wide. Unfortunately, I forgot to look at it when I got home, because my brakes needed repair, they were sticking, and I had the parts to fix it and went imediately to work. I forgot to check for the thing when I got home. Bummer. Later that night my wifes daughter said she saw a UFO. Well, she has never said that. So, I asked her to show me this UFO. She took me outside and pointed out the end of our driveway at five or six stars. These stars were low in the sky, and I have always said that a star low in the sky is messed up by the atmosphere at that level and stars can appear strange. However, she has never said anything like that ever. So, I observed these stars, the bottom one was bright and flickering. Not flashing like a plane but, flickering in a random pattern that probably was not atmospheric interference. The other four or five stars she pointed to seemed to be moving, the bright one too, moving, around and around ever so slightly. I will probably write them off as atmospheric disterbance but, then again this whole day did cause me to write you so, who knows. One last thing I must report to you, is that, about 1 month ago, in Barry County Michigan, somewhere near M-37 there was a report on Channel-8 news of crop damage. Ok, I thought here we go. But, now I am not so sure. The report was that some sorgum (spelling?) was knocked down in an unusual pattern. Swirling. Some UFO investigators were saying that it did not look like wind or hoax, it looked like radiation damage. But, the ag department of Michigan guy said it was caused by the farmer not harvesting his sorgum soon enough. Nobody seems to know. And now the black rainbow. And my wifes daughters sighting of moving stars."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Delton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Delton","Latitude":"42.499854","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:30:55","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.499854,+-85.408229(5465)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5465) map </A>","Object Features":"Patterned Surface"}
