We knew this because it was moving faster than the rest of the air planes that were in the air and it only emitted one bright light that pulsed a few times randomly as it was going across the sky. It would move in a straight line then slow down abruptly like it was hovering then it would go again, sometimes in a different direction than it was originally headed in. It pulsed like two or three times and each time it would only be 3-5 seconds before it would turn on again, until it eventually disappeared."],"Latitude":"37.841001","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-120.245983","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Groveland","There were no other sightings in Groveland on or around August 4th 2013"],"Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49503.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49503.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.841001,+-120.245983(49503)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49503) map </A>","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Log Number":"US-08052013-0027","Summary":"Me and 3 friends were out there looking at the stars when we realized that we something flying in the sky that wasn't an air plane.
