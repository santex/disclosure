{"Case Number":"44812","Region":"Texas","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt about 4PM on December 21, 2012 I noticed a bright beam to the west and started taking pictures with my IPad, I came in and saw several pictures of a gold disk moving around, then went back outside and took more pictures. I have about 20 pictures. The next set of pictures shows a blue sphere hovering just above the ground about 60 feet directly in front of me, it had a light going straight out from it and appears to have an aura around it, it also changes color from light to dark blue and seems to have a white digital line separating it, the it suddenly dissappears. This is our second sighting, the first was on November 3, 2012 which we also reported and we have many pictures. Someone from MUFON contacted us, but we have not heard from him again. I will send a few pictures but we have more."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12272012-0006","Object Features":"Window(s), Patterned Surface, Other","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44812.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44812.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.847725,+-95.888515(44812)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44812) map </A>","City":"Katy","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder, Disc, Sphere","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/21/2012 04:05 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Katy","There were no other sightings in Katy on or around December 21st 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"12/27/2012 05:47 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"29.847725","Longitude":"-95.888515","Summary":"Gold disk in the air, white orbs, cylindrical object above","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
