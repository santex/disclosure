He looked directly up in the air and said \"what the F$&# is that? I got off the porch and ran over to him. It was metallic in color and round in shape. It was at about 15,000 feet. Mind you there were two other commercial plans in the air at the time (That was how I tried to judge the size and altitude. But just a guess since I had no idea the size of the craft) Jet streams and all. One was to the North west traveling west, the other was also west heading north. I only remember this because I noticed one had a jet stream that was dissipating quickly while the other was hanging around longer than normal. Anyway as I look up it was directly over my house heading south (towards Avon). This thing was moving rather quickly in a direct path but was zig zagging like a sailboat in tact. The zig zags were slower in between zig and zag, then it began to zig zag quicker; about 45 seconds it darted right then disappeared."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Brownsburg","Summary":"Circle Heading south at 20,000 (maybe)","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Log Number":"US-10182010-0014","Latitude":"39.847677","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.847677,+-86.391554(25960)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25960) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Brownsburg","There were no other sightings in Brownsburg on or around October 17th 2010"]}
