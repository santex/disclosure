{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Federal Heights","There were no other sightings in Federal Heights on or around November 16th 2012"],"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is a UFO sighting seen at federal heights on just west of 84th and federal. Put your slow motion video camera down and at noon till 1pm MST, a few times a week, these fast moving objects will appear. The UFO(s) are really fast and are really hard to see with the naked eye. Serval news stations started showing up and got footage of this. The UFO appear to take off fast then move around the sky at astonishing speed and possibly land but it's below the tree line so that is unknown. Check it out just google \"UFO over Denver\" or \" mile high UFO sighting\". They have professional video equipment catching the event. It's an on going thing. Get your video cameras out and go just west of federal and south of 84th. It's a dirt clearing across from a hospital and shopping center. Point your camera towards Denver around noon MST. Lasts about an hour. Still not sure what it is but it's very unusual."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular, Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.864852,+-105.021255(44020)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44020) map </A>","City":"Federal Heights","Date Submitted":"11/19/2012 03:49 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-11192012-0006","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Colorado","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.864852","Longitude":"-105.021255","Date of the Event":"11/16/2012 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Other","Summary":"Mile High UFO sighting - google it!","Case Number":"44020","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44020.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44020.html"]}
