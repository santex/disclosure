I thought it may have been a tower light until it slowly started to move west. As the object floated to the west, it lost its orange glow and appeared as a cylinder shaped craft. It went directly over my head, over my house towards the capital building in Lansing, MI. It was just above the tree tops. I've seen many odd flying objects, but this is the first time I've felt an overwhelming feeling of dread. Very ominous."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"43933","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.757129"}
