{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Detailswhen i walked out of my sister's home i looked up and there it was. It was about 60 degrees up in the night sky and after a couple of minutes it had dropped another 15 degrees. It was lit up and seemed to strobe. It appeared to have a white light and a red light. THe lights were strobbing, or the object was actually circling in a small radius. I know it was not an airplane or helicopter. It just hung there in the sky until it dropped. The lights were really moving fast and appeared to be moving in a circular motion. I've never seem anything like this before. I have seen lights in the sky that i couldn't ID but never like this. It just seemed to hang in the air until it dropped. I don't know what happened to it after i got into my car. My sister also saw it. I asked her if she saw it when i first noticed it and she did. We stood there for a couple of minutes discussing whether she should go get her camera. She has a small digital camera and decided that it wasn't strong enough to show anything."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/22/2009 09:55 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","trends":["There have been 50 other sightings in Knoxville","There were no other sightings in Knoxville on or around May 22nd 2009"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Log Number":"US-05222009-0019","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"05/22/2009 09:55 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"17073","Latitude":"35.961698","Longitude":"-83.919159","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.961698,+-83.919159(17073)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17073) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17073.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17073.html"],"Summary":"A circular object that had strobbing lights.","City":"Knoxville","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"Tennessee","Object Features":"Unknown"}
