I went out to the back alley, just to take the trash outside to the dumpster. All of a sudden I just happened to look up towards the western sky; I had seen a star-like object up towards the west. It was stationary. But it was twinkling different colors. I pulled out my droid cellphone and taken a picture of this star-like object. I DON���T know what this thing or what it is, all���s I know it was not an airplane. However, maybe it was a star or a planet from far away. Can you tell me what this is? Thank you"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Date Submitted":"09/26/2012 09:39 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.78661,+-87.737875(42829)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42829) map </A>","City":"Chicago","Region":"Illinois","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42829.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42829.html"]}
