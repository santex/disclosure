We just started on our way again on the freeway. My mom told me to look out at the shooting star, when i turned the light was larger than a typical shooting star and was yellow orange and very bright and hovered in one spot only just above the horizon. A few seconds later it shot straight in up into the sky and disappeared. I found it interesting how when it shot up it was a completely straight vertical path at a speed slightly slower than lightning. There was no trail and soon after it shot up it disappeared. I felt confused at first and then i realized i what i had just witnessed."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.900356,+-117.014933(35077)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35077) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Barstow","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown"}
