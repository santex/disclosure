Got a binoculars. It appeared tear drop shaped, then became round. It had the appearance of a small moon. I noticed it around 6:08 then disappeared quickly about 10 minutes after that. No sound, no movement, just hovered. This is not the first time I have seen odd phenomena in the sky here. I am intrigued by the sighting. It slowly disappeared as if a cloud was dissipating in warm air, which is common in this climate this time of year. My first thought was it was a large balloon."],"trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Scottsdale","There was one other sighting in Scottsdale on or around September 1st 2012"],"Date of the Event":"09/01/2012 06:06 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.454215,+-111.972276(42199)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42199) map </A>"}
