It's hard to discribe because it doesn't fit the discriptions of any UFOs frequently reported although it was flat. I lost sight of it when the bus I was on had driven through a patch of trees. After that, I had looked back and it wasn't there. I didn't tell anyone on the bus because they wouldn't belive it."],"Date of the Event":"10/19/2005 02:34 UTC","Longitude":"-74.747385","Region":"New Jersey","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.672601,+-74.747385(4012)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4012) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/19/2005 02:34 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Square, Rectagular","Summary":"somewhat top-looking"}
