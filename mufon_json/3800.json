I was about 5:30pm perhaps 5:45. I was driving south on the 169. I had just passed where the freeway had split off to the 18 and the 13. I still was on the 169. I noticed up in the sky a round silver object. At first I thought it was a plane. I looked up at it a several times thinking that it was kind of strange looking plane. Suddenly a bright light came from the object. So bright I was blinded for a second. I was looking at it at the time. I thought that it was a reflection from the sun, but with the entire airplanes I have seen in my life I have not ever seen it reflect light like that. Because I was driving, I had to keep glancing at the road as I was trying to follow the strange looking plane. After the bright light, the object was there for about a minute or less then it disappeared. It left no vapor trail. And I kept glancing up to see if I could spot it again, but I no longer could see it."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09032005-0002","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Shakopee","There were no other sightings in Shakopee on or around September 2nd 2005"],"Summary":"round silver object","Region":"Minnesota","Date of the Event":"09/02/2005 05:30 UTC","Latitude":"44.797396","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/02/2005 05:30 UTC","City":"Shakopee","Tags":"City"}
