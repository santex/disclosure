I found a black spect at nine o'clock, at the sun's corona, near edge. It wasn't right away that I noticed this anomally. Not untill months latter. I was zooming up pictures and studying the sun and noticed the small saucer like object. It is too well defined to be confused with a plane or bird. I also don't think it is a ballon. So I sent it to mufon for your viewing.
