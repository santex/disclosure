As I am a FI in Northern Michigan residing in Cottonwood, AZ for the winter season, I thought I should try to see that the sighting got reported. I was able to speak with two of the witnesses on December 20th, 2011 about their sighting. They do not have a computer, but were agreeable to my making a report on their behalf. On December 24th, 2011 I placed a report on the Sedona, AZ website, but to date have heard from no one. The couple described a chevron-shaped object(in fact one of the witnesses drew a sketch of it for me)with five bright lights underneath that changed colors from red-white-green-blue when they were leaving a Cottonwood resturant at 7:30 PM. They were not able to estimate its size as they did not know the distance from them. It traveled in one direction fairly rapidly out of sight ."],"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Cottonwood","There were no other sightings in Cottonwood on or around December 9th 2011"],"Region":"Arizona","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
