{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting detailshello all i just wanted to say a few more things to our debunker. take a look at this video debunker. here���s the link http:\\\\www.ufocasebook.com\\yt4.html is this your so called flares theory? do flares fly and take up formations and move like this away from the formation? let me guess they are remote controlled. not also another point i���d like to make is with all the wildfires going on not to far from this area of the country and since its so dry why would the military take a risk of starting more wildfires from flares? it just doesn't make sense. these are the same craft that are in the arizona mountains. i believe that these extraterrestrial races that are involved with the shadow government have bases in the mountainous areas all over the world and phoenix happens to be close to one of these such areas. what we are seeing in this area are in fact real extraterrestrial craft and they are not trying to hide. these advanced extraterrestrial beings want us to know they are among us, you the shadow government are the ones who don���t want us to see the truth���. in the photos of the disks i don���t see any kind of objects that would resemble flares do you? mr. debunker sometimes you just have to look at all the angles. don���t be angry, the truth is about to be known to all of us."],"Date of the Event":"11/25/2007 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arizona","Latitude":"33.457617","Summary":"More Phoenix UFO Webcam Stills with Info","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Disc, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8462.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8462_submitter_file1__sm112507730pm.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8462_submitter_file2__sm112507815pm.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8462_submitter_file3__sm112507700pm.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8462.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/25/2007 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-112.065767","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.457617,+-112.065767(8462)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8462) map </A>","City":"Phoenix","Log Number":"US-11262007-0003","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 19 other sightings in Phoenix on or around November 25th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"8462","Tags":"City"}
