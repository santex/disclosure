They did not make a sound and the lights did not flash like a plane. We assumed they were satellites but I didn't think satellites moved north. Then I heard and saw a plane with red blinking lights coming from the east to the intercept area of 2 lights. When it got close to the position I saw a non pulsing light heading back south without sound. Satellites do not change direction. This was moving faster than any satellite I have ever seen. The red flashing lights and plane looked unusual too as it appeared the lights were really far apart given how faint the sound appeared. The non-blinking lights were moving much faster than the plane. Did any one else see this? I would like to know what this was."],"Date of the Event":"06/22/2012 12:00 UTC","City":"Bristol","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.705022","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/22/2012 12:32 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39703.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39703.html"],"Longitude":"-85.842705","Case Number":"39703","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-06222012-0002"}
