Later as well when i got home about 10 mins later. It looked as though there was a burning on the outside of the object. I noticed it in the sky as it was fast moving towards the east heading over towards Ireland and America way. After about 3 mins of observing it seamed to fade out of existence. It had a very defined flight path and looked as though a satellite was dropping out of orbit and burning up on entry My first thinking was either the earth had sped up and the stars were moving faster but that is obviously ridiculous, second though was grab my camera but by the time i had returned and set up my camera it had faded to black."],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"10/23/2010 06:17 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"26066","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Southport","There were no other sightings in Southport on or around October 10th 2010"],"Summary":"Orange-Red sphere flying at high alt","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.646788,+-3.003583(26066)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26066) map </A>","Longitude":"-3.003583","Region":"England"}
