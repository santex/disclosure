I just stood there for awhile in amazement. To the right of this object was a dim star. I immediately ran in the house to get someone to make sure I wasnt hollusonating. They were also as amazed as I. The object made no noise. It was beautiful. Hopefully it wasn't anything bad. We brought out the camera but the Orb had went too far below the trees to catch it. Will be more prepared if theres a next time."],"Region":"Virginia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/17/2013 08:51 UTC","Object Shape":"Diamond, Sphere","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.627382,+-77.313259(50881)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50881) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-09172013-0011","Longitude":"-77.313259","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50881.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50881.html"],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Summary":"Orb was extremely bright, brighter than the full moon tonight.
