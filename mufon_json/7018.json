My wife spotted a bright object in the sky that was different than the stars. It was oblong in appearance and I am pretty sure it was off in the distance quite a bit. It appeared to move quickly left and then back right. It was not blinking like a plane, but it was obviously not a star. It \"pulsed\" brighter a few times and then a beam of light projected from under the bright spot three times. The object became brighter and then it just disappeared."],"Latitude":"41.761451","Region":"Massachusetts","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/13/2007 08:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Wareham","There were no other sightings in Wareham on or around May 13th 2007"],"Date Submitted":"05/13/2007 08:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7018.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7018.html"],"Longitude":"-70.719734","Object Shape":"Egg, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
