While driving I observed to the west one large white spotlight with a blue light circling it and two smaller white objects off to either side. Above the white light was a red light that pulsated. When this red light pulsated it lite up the top of the craft. I could see that it was a gun metal gray triangular shaped craft. I could tell that the white light,the blue light and the red light above were located in the center of the craft. The two smaller white lights were at the corners of the craft. As I was traveling I observed this through the trees. I stopped a short distance down the road where there was an opening in the trees and there was a farm house in the distance. It appeared that the craft was hovering over the farm house. While stopped I was able to take one photograph of the object. The object left in an unknown direction."],"Log Number":"US-08182011-0036","Region":"Oklahoma","Longitude":"-97.317969","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.058356","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Slaughterville","There was one other sighting in Slaughterville on or around August 18th 2011"],"Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.058356,+-97.317969(31008)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31008) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31008.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31008.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Dome"}
