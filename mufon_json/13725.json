{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI came back from taking my dad home and went out on the back deck to look at the stars. I had my green 5mw laser with me. There was a very light high cloud cover and I was flashing the laser into them. The clouds were still thin enough to see the brightest stars. I observed a light that seemed to pulse slowly on then off. I watched for a few seconds and then flashed the laser in the direction of the light. It again pulsed on and off. I waited and nothing happened. Once again, I flashed the laser and the light again pulsed. This happened several times and then it streaked toward the north and disappeared. It was a very white light. The light as I observed it, was at about the 11 oclock position in the east north east direction. This was not a plane first of all, because it didn't move. I understand that at a high altitude, a slow moving plane could be interpreted as to be not moving from the perspective of the ground, however this did not move. Secondly, this light was not aircraft lights. Aircraft lights pulse off and on at about 1-2 second intervals. I don't know the exact flash rate for aircraft lights, but I have observed too many aircraft in my life. This light did not flash that way. It was not a meteor. Also, the light from my angle of sight, would not have been bright enough or as visible if it were aircraft lights. One thing that I find strange, and I am going to attribute it to not paying attention to the time, I took my dad home and left my house just before 7pm. It takes about 20 minutes from my house to his and 20 minutes back. If I say that I left my house at 7 that would put me back at my house at about 7:40pm. I will round that up to 8pm to account for any stray time. When I got home I stopped in the house for about 3-4 minutes before I went out on the back deck. I wasn���t wearing a jacket, just my work shirt, and it was a little chilly. That puts the time at about 8:05pm. I remember for about 5 minutes just playing with the laser shining it in random directions watching the beam. That puts it at about 8:10pm. I also remember that as I observed the light pulsing, I came out of a slight daze. I watched for a few more minutes after it streaked away and came back in the house. I looked at my daughter Stephanie, on the computer in the kitchen, to which she said, ���Wow, have you been outside this whole time?��� I then looked at the clock and it was 9:15pm. If I round the time that I was playing randomly with the laser down to 8:30 and take the away 5 minutes for the few minutes after it went away, that still leaves 40 minutes that I don���t remember being out there at all. I don���t know what to make of this. I am aware of the missing time phenomenom, but I am trying to guess at alternatives. Do I think that I was taken aboard this object? No, but I can't explain the time."],"Summary":"Pulsing light","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Washington","Date of the Event":"10/26/2008 09:05 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:40:00","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Port Angeles","There were no other sightings in Port Angeles on or around October 26th 2008"],"City":"Port Angeles","Country":"United States","Case Number":"13725","Log Number":"US-11152008-0008","Latitude":"48.122356","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.122356,+-123.423481(13725)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13725) map </A>","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","Longitude":"-123.423481","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13725.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13725.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/26/2008 09:05 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
