{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI WAS FLYING IN MY SMALL AIRCRAFT WITH MY LIFE PARTNER CEDRIC FOR A VERY SPECIAL NEW YEARS FLIGHT, WHEN WE ENCOUNTERED WHAT WE BOTH DETERMINED TO BE A UFO. ALTHOUGH OUR ENCOUNTER WAS BRIEF, IT IS FOREVER ETCHED IN OUR MINDS. UPON LANDING WE SEEN A VERY LARGE FLYING CRAFT HOVERING ALONG THE AIRFIELD, AND THEN IT BEGAN TO ZIG AND ZAG AS IF THE LAWS OF PHYSICS DID NOT APPLY. FORTUNATELY, WE HAD OUR VIDEO CAMERA AND WE CAPTURED SOME VERY ASTONISHING FOOTAGE. AS OF NOW, WE ARE AFRAID TO SHOW OUR VIDEO TO ANYONE, AS WE ARE ALREADY PERSECUTED BECAUSE OF OUR LIFESTYLE."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.714727","City":"New Port Richey","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"ENCOUNTERD UFO WHILE FLYING MY SMALL AIRCRAFT","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Region":"Florida","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.246477,+-82.714727(8895)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8895) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-01152008-0038","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8895.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8895.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"28.246477","Disposition":"Hoax","Case Number":"8895","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in New Port Richey","There were no other sightings in New Port Richey on or around January 1st 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
