It was around midnight so I thought kt was just a plane but it was too close to the ground and not as large as one. It was a really bright green I was surprised no one else stopped to look at it really it was that strange. It seemed to have a flame trail behind it and shaped kinda like oval. I stopped to tale a picture to but then it just vanished in a blink of a eye. I was very baffled by this because there was a car behind me but I don't think they saw it and I don't think my friend noticed the UFO either"],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Copperas Cove","There were no other sightings in Copperas Cove on or around June 15th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/29/2013 03:19 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.900278","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Copperas Cove","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49280.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49280.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
