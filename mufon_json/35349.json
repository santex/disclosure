{"City":"Indianola","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailsdriving home after dark, 1 to 1 and a half miles from home towards the West. Noticed bright light in the Western sky thought it was a falling star and realized it was moving and getting larger. It stopped ahead of me and fell down to tree level and hovered with different colored lights. It was cloudy around the object, the lights were bright with lights around the edges blinking from right to left with no pattern. Stopped vehicle and got out to look, called wife, then tried to take picture with cell phone. Approximately 4 mins, then it went to the South and then North East and was gone fast. Got back in vehicle and continued to drive home. Was about a quarter mile or less from home and saw it again in the West again, and was hovering over a field. Called wife again and talked while watching it. Lasted a couple minutes, and it disappeared. Continued driving home, pulled in driveway and as I was coming up driveway over trees behind home. It didn't hover, was moving slowly then streaked away to the North West."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01302012-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.943171,+-87.684296(35349)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35349) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-87.684296","Region":"Illinois","Date Submitted":"01/30/2012 02:23 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"witnessed object 3 times while driving home after dark","Date of the Event":"01/14/2012 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.943171","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35349.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35349.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Case Number":"35349","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Indianola","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."]}
