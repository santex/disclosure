As I passed LSUS on the right I noticed a small circular object in the northwest part of the sky. It was getting close to sunset. The object was much lighter than sky. As I passed 70th the object was more to the west than the north, i could see it was actually teardrop shaped. It was unlike anything i had ever seen. It was reflecting the sun. Not bright though. Just making it a few shades lighter than the sky. The sky was a light peachy color. So it was much lighter than that. It did not move. It stayed stationary high in the sky. When I got to Southfield Rd nd turned left the many trees in the neighborhood blocked my view of it. I was late for an appointment so I could not turn around and try to locate it again."],"Date of the Event":"06/23/2011 08:08 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
