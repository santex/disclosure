I took it for a falling star and paid it no mind. Minutes go by and another light appeared, this time much closer, flew over me and disappeared. I was shocked the second time around because it didn't look like a falling star, it looked like an object with multiple lights attached to it. I waited to see if another one would appear but nothing happened after that."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Montville","There were no other sightings in Montville on or around April 4th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Connecticut","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.471534,+-72.08951(37132)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37132) map </A>","City":"Montville","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-72.08951","Summary":"A light appeared, went in a straight line and disappeared.","Date of the Event":"04/04/2012 11:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-04052012-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
