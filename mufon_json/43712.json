This object is literally flashing all kinds of colors randomly and staying stationary. I lost sight of the object while actually typing this. My initial reaction to what i first saw 4 weeks ago was that it must be a satellite but the object stayed stationary for 20 minutes before it disappeared (no movement that i could see). Tonight when i saw the object it also didnt move but i only observed the object long enough for me to get to this site and start typing, maybe 7 minutes."]}
