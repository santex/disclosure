There is a Royal Australian Air Force base about 2 hours drive from where I live and at first I thought it was a jet doing a flyover but then the lights changed direction, they turned almost 180 degrees and headed in a south easterly direction from where I had seen them originate. They went right over my friends, Who shall remain anonymous, and we both got a good enough look to see that it was a cylindrical object roughly 70-80 metres long and roughly 20 metres wide. We were both confused about what we had seen. Later when I was going home I noticed that I had no recollection for 2 hours of the night and whenever I try to remember what happened I only get the image of a giant bird swooping down on me, I still get headaches when I try to recall the night in question. It was my 22nd birthday."],"Country":"Australia"}
