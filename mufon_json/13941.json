This was about the same spot as the one last night, my son says it's about 70 degrees up in the sky to the south. I ran in to grab my video camera and call the kids out. The youngest stayed inside, she thinks we're nuts. This one was moving to the west slowly then emitted a particle trail like the one yesterday and then was moving south or decending. We didn't get to see it long enough to get it sighted in with the telescope because after it did the explosion part we couldn't see it very well with our eyes, well the two kids that came out could still see it as it was brightening and dimming. There was also a satellite or another object that passed in front of it, south west to the north east, as it was headed south, we think maybe a satellite. Looking at the satellite I lost sight of the object and so I tried to get the satellite on tape. There was none-to little wind and some clouds. We will be looking for more in the days ahead."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Case Number":"13941","Region":"Oregon","Latitude":"42.760415","Longitude":"-122.484197","Log Number":"US-11242008-0021","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Prospect","There was one other sighting in Prospect on or around November 24th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.760415,+-122.484197(13941)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13941) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/24/2008 04:47 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/24/2008 04:47 UTC","Summary":"another bright white sphere that has some kind of emission","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None"}
