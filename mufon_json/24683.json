It would also intrest you in that earier we all did a night walk and photograghed more than a hundred orbs. i know this sounds nuts but i would e happy to show the pictures. i didn't get a pic of the bright lights. but please give us the benefit of the dought and call and we can tell you more. i later went to were i saw the bright light and it was in a circle of trees that would have been difficult if not impossible to climb on in the dark. and somehow that spot has intest energy. i am able to show you were the light exactly and where the orbs were. i am hoping for a logical explation and need your help. i was startled but not scared that much and neither was the boyfriend we went right back to bed. and for the last crazy thing i am going to tell you is that this is not my first enounter. please please just call and jive me a chance to tell you and answer questions to find out what this was."],"Latitude":"42.199756","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07212010-0002"}
