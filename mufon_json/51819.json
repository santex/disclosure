At first I thought it was perhaps the space station, as this is sometimes observed just after dark on a clear night. However, the space station is usually quite bright when visible. This object was faint and had an irregular flight path. Also, the object came to a complete stop and hovered. As it hovered, a set of faint yellow-orange lights were visible. Then the object suddenly and sharply began to move my direction in a descent and for a brief moment I could observe a large dark cylindrical object dotted with yellow-orange lights. The object became faint again and was barely visible as it appeared to ascend and then to move in a SW direction. After another minute I lost visual contact."],"Region":"Texas","Case Number":"51819","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.89524,+-96.987479(51819)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51819) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"10/24/2013 10:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-10242013-0036","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51819.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51819.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"[flg] Large cylindrical object with yellow-orange lights was faintly observable during an irregular flight path with hover","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Irving","There were no other sightings in Irving on or around October 24th 2013"]}
