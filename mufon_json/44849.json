He screamed for me to come outside and see something ,I ran out and pointed towards the sky, he told me whilst he was playing with marbles on the ground he noticed a shadow cast( circular size of a car) over the ground and it moved extremely fast and it made no sound at all.Looking at where he was pointing I could see a sphere shaped object in the sky. It was solid and appeared to be moving fairly fast. I heard no sound and I couldn't make out what the object was, it didn't look like a plane, I ran inside for my camera and when I got outside I couldn't see it any longer, I took 2 pictures in the direction I saw it.I was not hopeful that I got anything. I recently decided to study the photos and found with the first photo i took had object displayed albeit now much further in the distance. Not sure what it was but it was very strange especially that it didn't make any noise."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44849.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44849.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"-26.251392","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-26.251392,+28.005434(44849)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44849) map </A>","Log Number":"ZA-12302012-0003"}
