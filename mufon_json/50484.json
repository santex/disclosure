The beam was to high up to come from any of the single level homes here. This continues until I gave up and went to bed. But the unusual part is there was triangle shaped aircraft flying in odd patterns. Tried to take video with phone but laser beam was to thin for our phones to record very well."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.910143,+-122.977727(50484)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50484) map </A>","City":"Salem","Log Number":"US-09062013-0024","Region":"Oregon","Summary":"green laser beam appearing about every 10 seconds coming from sky","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Salem","There were no other sightings in Salem on or around September 1st 2013"],"Case Number":"50484","Date Submitted":"09/06/2013 11:37 UTC","Longitude":"-122.977727","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00"}
