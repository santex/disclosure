I noticed something bright in the sky, so I grabbed my camcorder and started filming. At first I could only see one slow strobing light because it was headed straight towards me. Then it made a fairly sharp turn to the left and that is when I could really see the triangle light pattern on this object. Of the three lights, only one was strobing. After I knew I had some clear footage of it, I stopped filming briefly to set up my tripod. It was already connected to my camcorder. I then resumed filming but by that time this object had really picked up its speed. I could not get a steady shot even with my tripod. It then got so far away I could not see it anymore. This object made no sound at all. Really strange!"],"City":"Dublin","Longitude":"-98.338308","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Dublin","There were no other sightings in Dublin on or around June 22nd 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-12252011-0008"}
