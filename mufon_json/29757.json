{"divs":["sighting detailsi have two ducks and a dog, the last couple of days at around 10 i let them outside and walk around the front yard for atleast 30 minutes, this is when i see these orbs. first night this started happening was on 6\\24\\2011 10:20 p.m. let my ducks and dog walk around the front yard after 10 mins i look up and forwards and through a tree there was a light blue orb like a star went in a circle and started coming my way, it wasnt close didnt look like it was in the atmosphere. so i run inside and yell at my dad to come look when we get back outside its not there so we sit there looking for a min or 2 and i see it again but this time its right over us, my dad sees it also we watch it for a few seconds heading towards houston until it dissapears.then the next time i saw this orb was two days later 6\\26\\2011, i look up and its right there directly above me again but this time heading east watch it for 20 seconds until it vanishes . and tonight 6\\27\\2011 10:27, 10:35, 10:47 saw it above me but not directly above me moving east again and turn north moving pretty fast and it vanishes saw it the second in front of me moving east agin and go north as if it was going in circles in a 40 mile radius or more and the third time this time right above me again going east, and that was it. also as a child had a strange experience when i was around 8. woke up on my back couldnt move, it was hard to breathe, the only thing that could move were my eyes and i look up and at the end of my bed was a tall dark figure , i was scared to death, thought maybe it was a bad dream, but never had anything like that ever happen in a dream it was so real undescribable, after that incident had a terrible ear infection for two weeks and saw it again in my room. both times when i was able to move again i ran to my parentas screaming sweating and crying, i remember it to this day saying i dont understand what happened i dont know i dont know,i didnt want to go back to sleep for the longest. it has been stuck in my head ever since. i would like maybe if someone could contact me maybe come with a camera and get these orbs recorded this has got to be the real deal. thank you daniel"],"Summary":"Walk outside star gazing seen Orb in the sky for the last 3 days around same time but this time saw it three times","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"29757","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Crosby","There were no other sightings in Crosby on or around June 27th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"06/28/2011 12:52 UTC","City":"Crosby","Log Number":"US-06282011-0002","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.917238,+-95.053761(29757)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29757) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-95.053761","Latitude":"29.917238","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29757.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29757.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/27/2011 10:27 UTC"}
