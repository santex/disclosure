At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO���s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert in North Phoenix near Cave Creek, AZ. and always enjoy the view. The mountains and horizon looked like a postcard and the horizon was purplish blue. As I gazed up at the sky, I noticed that there were a lot of trails crossing the sky. In fact, the sky was full of them. And there seemed to be a gigantic X in the sky where two of the largest ones crossed each other. My husband and I thought that this was very odd indeed. On further reflection, it seemed that the X marked a meeting spot. Then we noticed that coming from the north, very high in the horizon, what appeared at first to be a plane was not a plane at all. It was soundless, for one thing and moved erratically. I could not believe my eyes. It jumped around sporadically in a fashion that no plane is capable of doing. As it jumped, it blinked, and then it hovered, waiting. Why was it waiting? Then we noticed that an actual plane ( or what seemed at first to be a plane) was some distance from it but seemed to have some connection with this object as well as the other unidentified flying objects. This first one would not continue on its path until the plane- or what appeared to be a plane- turned off its lights. At that point, the object flew in a southernly direction in a slightly more normal path though at no time did any of them have the noise of a plane. This happened several times. We saw seven of them, and they did not all appear to be exactly the same though they all did act in an erratic fashion. Some had orangish lights and some had greenish lights. Some were bigger than others and seemed to have lights that blinked as if they were rotating discs. The smallest of these were more cigar or bullet shaped and the size of a plane, but two seemed to be much larger. One was in the shape of a triangle. We watched fascinated. Before we left, one of the very largest ones first hovered and then headed in the opposite direction. It first headed closer to us and then followed us across the street like a low flying plane above the trees which made me feel quite uneasy indeed. Except for the last one, we lost sight of all objects over the horizon or they seemed to just disappear. Also, while this was going on at one point we looked at the moon and it was clear. Five minutes later there was a distinct trail across it- like a long line. There were no lights moving in the area. If it was created by a chemtrail in the area, then the flying object had no lights as we saw nothing saw cross the moon. It is odd that they all came from the same exact place and seemingly from out of nowhere. We watched them as they appeared. My husband now suggests it was perhaps from the area of 51 Las Vegas. They all headed in the same direction ( seemed to be Goldwater Preserve SW of Phoenix). We could not identify any landing. One flew back to the point of origin, inexplicably. The rest, five, continued on out of our sight except for the last one which followed us. It seemed to be a convoy mission of some sort ( some escorting others into the area that they were all headed). The ���plane��� that shut its lights off and then on from the object waiting to make its flight seemed to be giving it a signal to pass. Also, not only was their behavior bizarre (hovering and stationary and then deep ascents or descents) , soundless, and erratic, but they appeared to have come from a much greater distance than a plane possibly could. When they first appeared, they seemed to be brighter than the brightest star, so perhaps that gives some indication of size and distance. It seems as if they came out of thin air and were at first at a much greater distance. In fact, at first they looked star like, then like several bright points that jumped around a bit( to get stabilized?) and then, coming closer (it appeared) into our atmosphere, you could detect some type of shape with lights (green or red) at the bottom of the unidentified flying object. They all moved noiselessly unlike planes and were able to move in a manner unlike any plane. We did not take our eyes off of them, but I had the creepy feeling with some of them that they were trying to approximate the look of a plane once they began to fly in the same southwesterly direction. However, planes do not shut their lights off or hover and come to a standstill, planes do not come out of nowhere as far away as a star then jump in inexplicable patterns, and planes do not fly noiselessly. I was not sure whether or not they actually changed their shape or the shape came into focus as it came closer. My husband and I are serious, well-educated and professional people and have no reason to be making this up."],"Log Number":"US-07292012-0006","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41241.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41241.html"],"City":"Phoenix","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.726548,+-112.021264(41241)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41241) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/27/2012 08:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 2 other sightings in Phoenix on or around July 27th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"July 27 7 UFOS seen N Phoenix near Cave Creek changing shape blinking red green","Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like","Case Number":"41241","Date Submitted":"07/29/2012 02:53 UTC"}
