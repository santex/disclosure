I noticed an object directly overhead that looked like a comet. I called my wife and we both looked at it for about 10 minutes. The head of the comet pointed to the West and a cone shaped tail spread out toward the East from the head a short distance. The object did not appear to be moving, which made me think the object was a comet as they move very slowly in relation to the Earth rotating. The object did not appear to be low in the atmosphere as commercial planes could be seen by their navigation lights, but none of them passed in front of the object. I tried to view it through binoculars but was unable to gain the focus needed to see the object well. I went inside and surfed the internet for about 20 minutes trying to find the name of the comet, but I found nothing. I returned outside look at the object again, but the object had disappeared. I can only surmise that what I saw was not a comet, but something else."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"12/10/2007 07:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"29.898364","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in St Augustine","There were no other sightings in St Augustine on or around December 10th 2007"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Other","Case Number":"8604","Log Number":"US-12142007-0001"}
