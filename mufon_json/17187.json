(later he said it sounded like kids giggling but very sinister) i said no (i didn't hear that part)and stood waiting for the baby to say something. still no sound so i went another 50 yards to another creek all the while scanning the area with the rechargable spot light. i turned off the light to see if the baby would call out again but heard nothing. still no sound so i turned the light on again which then rapidly faded out and was useless with no warning. i could just make out the house lights through the trees but otherwise it was completely pitch black around me. i gave up the search and was just starting to head back when i hear what sounded like a human pretending to whine like a puppy just inches from my right foot. i could hear it rustle the leaves so i called out \"come here boy, it's alright\" but then it occurred to me that it did not sound like a real dog so i hurried to exit as quick as i could fighting through bushes and small trees dense enough to warrant breaking and plowing and i could hear the sound of the rustling leaves right behind me. the two whines occurred again and this time it sounded like it was giggling as it made the sound. right on my heels and keeping up with my speed. i finally got back to the muddy creek bank and slid down it on my butt to the bottom (15 feet) and the whining sound happened again right from the edge i just slid down . doug said, \"i sounds like it's right behind you \". i ran through the creek this time looking for the best slope to get me out the gully. i took the lowest part (about 8 feet) and scrambled and clawed my way up the muddy bank and as i neared the top something flew right by my right ear making a strange whirling\\giggling sound. doug saw me come out of the gully and had full view of me while this happened. he heard it but could see nothing. we both went up to the house, i breathing like i'd run a marathon. the unmistakable feeling that this thing was \"harassing\" me was felt strongly by both of us. it had chased me out of the woods and now on retrospect have to wonder if this wasn't a trap, make a sound like a baby deer, lure the person into the woods and ..... it had 3 distinct and different vocalizations. though it rustled the leaves was apparently invisible to the naked eye. i've spent most of my adult life studying all aspects of scientific inquiry and my gut feeling was that was not normal. doug is a well known wildlife veterinarian who could offer no reasonable explanation. it wasn't an animal."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/26/2009 06:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05272009-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.582831,+-90.662905(17187)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17187) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Wildwood","There were no other sightings in Wildwood on or around May 26th 2009"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17187.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17187.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.582831","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
