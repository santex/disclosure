My mom took the photos and sent them to me asking me if i knew. She was taking pictures in the backyard of my nephew swimming and playing in the pool when it caught her eye. It stayed perfectly still (appeared to at least)and then was just gone. If you know what it is please let me know, if its something of interest let me know and i will try to get more info on the time of day etc... It doesnt appear to be a solid object but the narrow line streaming from side to side is odd and it doesnt seem to fade as the clouds move.
