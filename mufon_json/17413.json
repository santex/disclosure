I just read the report of the Maryland sighting at 9:30 pm so decided to try to resubmit the form. I was outside on my porch at 11 pm. I was smoking a cig. and saw a bright flash of light in the SE that caught my eye. I stood there looking for the source. I then saw a lime green point of light pulse in the sky. I watched for another minute trying to make out what was making the light because it was overcast. I saw a faint dark red object moving in the clouds where the yellow green light appeared. I was not scared. These things used to scare me but now I am used to it. I have seen and report ufo's before. I am sure the investigators are sick of hearing from me. Which is why I almost didn't report this until I read the other sighting report. I wonder if anyone near Turnerville saw the same object."],"Object Shape":"Flash, Other","Latitude":"39.780785","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Washington","There were no other sightings in Washington on or around June 10th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
