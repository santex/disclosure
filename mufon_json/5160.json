{"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"5160","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were driving in RT46 in Clifton, NJ at 9:23 pm. I happened to look at the clock and then out my window. I saw this weird thing hovering in the sky. It was sort of cigar shaped and it was yellow and orange colored. It seemed to be giving off light, and it was vertical. I only saw it for about a minute or so because then the highway curved and there was a tall brick wall. About two minutes later there was a clearing and I could see the sky again but whatever it was, was gone. The only thing I kept saying to my husband is what the hell is that?? But he was driving and couldn't really see it. When I knew that it was gone I looked at the clock again and it was 9:25 pm."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.858433","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-07292006-0005","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.858433,+-74.163755(5160)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5160) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Clifton","There were no other sightings in Clifton on or around July 29th 2006"],"Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/29/2006 09:23 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5160.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5160.html"],"Longitude":"-74.163755","Date Submitted":"07/29/2006 09:23 UTC","Region":"New Jersey","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar","City":"Clifton","Country":"United States","Summary":"Cigar shape hovered in an uprite position"}
