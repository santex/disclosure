I noticed it as I walked up the stairs to my house. It was the brightest thing in the sky about triple the size of a star. Ive seen this before in my area 10+ times since March of 2012, but last night was the closest Ive ever seen it. I was able to zoom in and take a photo with my iPhone. The object on camera looks like a massive glowing blimp and is non-symmetrical. There is a disc with a bottom piece coming out that looks like the rudder of a boat that points at a diagonal down to the ground. the object also has a piece coming out of the top that looks like a ball or circle. It emits lots of light and a very faint beam. Last night it was all white. I immediately thought it was a UFO when I saw it. I live on an airplane flight path and watch the sky a fair bit. It is definitely not a satellite, space station or airplane. It is unlike anything I could readily identify. Last night the object moved up and down, higher and lower but stayed in the same general location in the sky about a mile up if I were to estimate. I feel nervous and curious when I see it. I lost sight of it because I went inside."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Sebastopol","There were no other sightings in Sebastopol on or around October 15th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Disc","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"(GS) Glowing blimp-like non-symmetrical disc hovering for hours, moving up and down, triple the size of a star, emitting bright white light.","Log Number":"US-10162012-0019"}
