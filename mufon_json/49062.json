Something caught my eye almost directly above where I was standing so I looked up at it. The object was stationary for a few seconds the abruptly started moving very fast. Covering half the sky in seconds. Then it stopped and got brighter then dimmed then bright again. I turned to look over the building and nearly fainted when I saw the other smaller lights. It was as if the other lights were waiting. Then the lights got in a somewhat formation and in the blink of an eye shot off into the clouds! Have 20 second video of it but I was too frightened to continue recording"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49062.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49062.html"],"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-86.24824","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Case Number":"49062","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Indiana","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/20/2013 10:29 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/20/2013 05:01 UTC","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in South Bend","There were no other sightings in South Bend on or around July 20th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-07202013-0007","Latitude":"41.683904","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.683904,+-86.24824(49062)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49062) map </A>","City":"South Bend","Summary":"Bright light appeared out of nowhere then started moving fast and met up with 10-15 more pulsating objects"}
