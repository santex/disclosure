Then, all of a sudden, out of no where a huge, very close, very low flying saucer appeared in front of us, but it was off to the side. There were two large black saucer plates that were rotating clockwise. In between the plates were green rotating letters or glyphs that was spinning counter clockwise. I still remember one glyph and it looked like a backwards number seven with a sideways colon on top. I was very calm, but I also felt excited. It stayed in place for about three or four seconds then it took off so fast it left a quick streak of black, green, black. It seemed like something you would see in a science fiction movie. When it took off, it made a distinct whistling noise. I was the only witness of the three in the vehicle as the two in the front seat were paying attention to the road."],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Disc, Other","Object Features":"Other","Case Number":"29069","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Oskaloosa","There were no other sightings in Oskaloosa on or around September 4th 2007"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
