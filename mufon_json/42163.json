The light slowly started rising up to what I'm guessing was around 500 feet and the glowing light went out. After 30 seconds or so a set of lights came on very dimly at first then slowly got brighter and began blinking in a rapid pattern of 3 very fast pulses of white followed by a single red blink. The object moved slowly overhead toward the northeast.As it passed overhead and began moving away, there seemed to be another set of lights on the far side that were pulsating in a different pattern. Eventually the object disappeared in the northeast"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.886515","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Triangle","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42163.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42163.html"],"Longitude":"-78.423306","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Ocean Isle Beach","There were no other sightings in Ocean Isle Beach on or around August 30th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/30/2012 11:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"42163","Date Submitted":"08/31/2012 01:05 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.886515,+-78.423306(42163)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42163) map </A>"}
