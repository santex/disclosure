I do live near a small airport, and thought it was a plane at first, until the lights started moving sideways, back and forth. This lasted about 14 seconds until the light turned green and I was too frightened and wanted to get home as quick as possible. I had to turn left, and then looked again for the lights as I turned again, but did not see them."],"Log Number":"US-10102009-0009","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"42.024544","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Other","Summary":"Three equal-spaced lights (as one) at a 45 degree angle moving back and forth."}
