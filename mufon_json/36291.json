I had gotten up to go down and check my computer because I could not sleep. When I came back up from downstairs I looked out my south facing window and saw what appeared to be a flashing light. This was the second time I had noticed similar lights at just after midnight. They both took place on Sunday nights or early Monday morning. First I thought it was a helicopter looking for a lost snowmobiler but after checking with search and recue the next day they didn't know about any lost or injured snowmobiler. It was hard to say what the size or shape was as it was at least five miles away from me. We over look Snowbank mountain and we have a good view from our windows. The object eventually dropped down behind the mountain ridge and I never saw it again."]}
