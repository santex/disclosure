I watched it for approximately 30 seconds before I pointed it out to my roommate. They also thought it was odd as it wasn't moving, and didn't have the outline of a normal aircraft (we see a lot of commercial aircraft going in and out of the Newark and NYC airports.) I went to go get my binoculars, and was gone for no more than 15 seconds. When I returned the object was gone, and both of us agreed that it would have been impossible for a normal aircraft to have left our field of vision so quickly (it was a clear day and the object was far from anything that could have obstructed our view.)"],"Date Submitted":"09/07/2013 09:56 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-09072013-0032"}
