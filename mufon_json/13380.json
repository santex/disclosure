It was huge! There was no sound! It looked very metalic... reflected the sun light.. standing still, no noise. I turned the car around to get a better look... and it started to move slowly... and then it just disappeared! When I got home I called the Indianapolis airport authority, FBI, Mt Comfort airport , Indiana State police..... there had not been any other reports made. I still can not figure out what I saw.... but what ever it was it was real close to us and I felt very strange afterwards."],"Region":"Indiana","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.771396,+-86.155174(13380)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13380) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/07/2008 09:15 UTC"}
