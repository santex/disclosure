I went in the house to get my wife and kids to look at it. They too witnessed it. The whole formation was moving from east to west. I said to them what is all the flashing lights following the orange orbes. My wife and kids just brushed it off thinking it was some sort of military crafts but I did not think so. We do live near Whiteman AFB and Skyhaven but that was not it. The movement of the objects were moving slower than a helicopter, jet or plane."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.822267,+-93.760172(36949)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36949) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-03272012-0049","Date of the Event":"03/26/2012 08:45 UTC","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Warrensburg","There were no other sightings in Warrensburg on or around March 26th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36949.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36949.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Summary":"3 balls of orange light traveling in a V formation being trailed not far behind by flashing strobes","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"36949","Region":"Missouri","City":"Warrensburg"}
