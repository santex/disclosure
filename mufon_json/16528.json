( time 4:40 pm) I was watching the road. I took random shots for photo reference for paintings . There were no clouds in the sky. Clear blue sky day. I discovered these images after downloading them on to my computer the next day. The smaller one is the first photo. The larger one is the second photo. These appear to be the same object, moving from southeast to northwest. The mountains run north to south. I was facing south on hwy 89 about 5 miles south of Livingston. The trees on the mountain are about 80 feet tall so this thing must have been pretty big and moving fast. I didn't hear any noise."],"Log Number":"US-04162009-0006","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"04/06/2009 04:40 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Livingston"}
