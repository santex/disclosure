She says to me look daddy, a round plane with bolts! I really did not look because I was driving. When we got home I began asking her questions. It was over a house and slowly moving south she pointed out to me. What is really more bizzare to me is at age 5 I too saw my first UFO. That was the first time my daughter even mentioned or talked about UFO. Two days later I asked her to draw me a picture of it. I was so amazed by this. I said draw me another. Almost a copy of the first one. I am so surprised because like I said never before did she ever known about UFO. See my girls pictures attached."],"Log Number":"US-01272010-0006","Case Number":"21680","Object Features":"Dome","Date Submitted":"01/27/2010 11:42 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Latitude":"38.888338","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/25/2010 04:40 UTC"}
