We looked at Spica, Saturn and Mars. When my dad mentioned the moons traverse westward, I see a floating orange and red egg shaped light to my right shoulder. At first I think it���s a helicopter but I still keep my eye on it. 9:25 My dad goes back inside but I stay behind to see if I could see that light again and as I���m walking back I look back and see two lights; one red going East from the North and one orange and red going South from the North. The object looked like it was on fire���rotating between red, orange and yellow. But there were no lights in the center of the object. So I run to the door and call my dad then I turn around and I can���t see it because it���s behind some trees. 9:30 When my dad comes out the object is visible he tells me to run and get the Binoculars inside. I get the binoculars and run outside. He says��� it hasn���t moved������as the object comes to rest Eastward between some trees. It seemed to be floating not moving in any direction. So I look at the object and it starts to speed up heading East directly away from us. 9:35 My dad asks for the binoculars and says ���it���s winking out��� and disappears. He mentioned that it seemed to just get smaller���like it was traveling straight away from us. 9:40 We go inside and tell our family and my Mom and Dad ask me to find out how to report my sighting."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Egg, Fireball, Sphere, Teardrop","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40093.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40093.html"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"38.456935","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.456935,+-90.571883(40093)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40093) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/02/2012 09:25 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"07/03/2012 12:14 UTC","City":"High Ridge"}
