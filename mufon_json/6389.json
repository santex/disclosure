The objects appeared to be about three or four miles away rising mostly straight up until reaching the clouds. When they reached the clouds I lost track of one object and the other moved to the south just below the clouds. The objects moved very fast, first shooting up about three thousand feet in less than five seconds and then, one object travel south for about two miles in about ten or twelve seconds before I lost it. Both objects were metallic looking spheres and left no visible exhaust or vapor trail. I wish I knew what I saw, it was the first time in years of keeping my eyes on the sky that I saw something that I clearly couldn���t identify."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.55543,+-110.273476(6389)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6389) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:17","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Two Spherical objects east of Sierra Vista AZ","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Sierra Vista","There were no other sightings in Sierra Vista on or around February 14th 2007"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6389.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6389.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
