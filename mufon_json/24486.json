{"Longitude":"-89.393028","City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24486","divs":["Sighting DetailsVery clear night looking at the stars and saw what looked just like a star way up in the sky. I was looking straight above when I looked a bit off to my left and saw an object that I would have thought was a star if it wasn't moving. This was so high up Ive never seen anything like it. White and bright light and round like a star but no glare or flickering like stars do. It was moving at a high speed first going sw and then making a half circle to eventually go straight north. It would block out light from the stars when it went under them. I can't gauge how fast it was moving since it was up so high. It covered nearly half of the visable sky I could see in 40 secs so that's fast. I know it was a UFO because the way it change directions. It seemed to fly jaged just a little bit but was mostly flying straight. Never saw anything like it before."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.635925,+-89.393028(24486)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24486) map </A>","Summary":"White sphere star-like object.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24486.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24486.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Illinois","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"07/10/2010 10:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-07132010-0014","Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Latitude":"40.635925","Date Submitted":"07/13/2010 02:21 UTC","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
