When I put her out the sky was still completly dark and I observed nothing. I went to start my coffee and heard my dog making a whining sound and when I looked out the window to check on her I saw an extremly bright star-like object just above the horizon to the east. I knew this light was not previously there and wondered how a planet, star, satalite or other known object could have appeared so quickly. After about 3 min. of observing this object it shot off to the left at the most amazing speed and disappeared. Then within seconds it reappeared in the other direction ,now to the right of where it had been. It stayed in this position but continued to slowly ascend for the next half hour until a cloud blocked my view."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32755.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32755.html"],"trends":[],"Date of the Event":"10/21/2011 06:00 UTC","Summary":"Observed a star-like object blinking which accelerated at a great deal of speed, disappeared then reappeared in a different location.","Longitude":"-69.439029","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10212011-0003","Region":"Maine","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
