so he 's like come on your crazy and i'm like just watch real carefully and a few minutes later it started doing those weired patterns again and it moved up down if you were looking at a clock it moved in the 1 oclock position from were it was previously sitting then back to were it was all the while changing colors and eveything it was doing before sticking pretty close to the same pattern everytime.jimmy saw that and he's like did you just see that also and i'm like, told you so, our daughter woke up and he went in and laid down with her.i stayed out there for another hour watching it seeing ehat else it would do but it stopped moving as much and just stayed white. then it appeared to be moving toward my direction at that time it was a whitish color turning gold and orange and yellows then white agaian(probably our pollution thats up there because the moon does that sometimes here). it was getting easier to see and looked a little bit bigger that was around 2:42am. and started this weired flashing type sequence the only way i can describe it was as morris code or something it always paused after the patterns and the changing of the colors. it was almost 3 am and i had to get some sleep that was the last time i have seen it i have stayed up every night and at the same time gone out side to see if it has been there and it is just not there the last two nights it has been cloudy and so i have not been able to see anything its going to rain soon. i have stayed up many nights looking at the stars from were i was sitting on the porch and i can honestly say that i have never seen anything like that before and i am now always going to look for it now on."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"04/05/2008 11:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"a round bright distinct light that changed color and shape and movement pattern.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10229.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10229.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10229.html"],"Date Submitted":"04/05/2008 11:30 UTC","City":"Porter"}
