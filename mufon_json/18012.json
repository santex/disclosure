Facing East, and noticed a bright light above and to the left of my position. Bright like Venus, moving steadily eastward. Grabbed 10x80 binoculars sitting in my open garage. Object looked the same thru objectives. Approx size of a pea at arms length. Bright bluish-white with an aura or halo as if illuminating moisture in the air. Humidity typically 18-20% here. Travelling at a steady rate north-north eastward. Well North of the plane of the ecliptic to my right. Not fading out as is typical with satellites. No sound. No deviation from straight path. Took approx 3-5 minutes to disappear over the Sierra Nevada mountains east of Fresno. No contrail or exhaust. No flames. No pieces seperating. No sound. Easily noticable to anyone looking up at the time."],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"36.787311","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/09/2009 10:28 UTC","Log Number":"US-07112009-0004","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.787311,+-119.411052(18012)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18012) map </A>","trends":[""],"Tags":"City","Region":"California"}
