At first there was a vaporous cloud around it but then that dissipated and the craft remained in clear blue sky. Next thing a much smaller craft more like a sharp clear orb zoomed around the stationary craft. We both had a sense of growing excitement in the realisation that we were witnessing something strange and ���������otherworldly���������. Whenever possible I now look out through the back door to try and verify if what we had witnessed was not a plane retreating into the distance and the light merely a reflection from the metal of the plane. I also considered that I could have been a bird, yet I realise that in the 5 minutes in which we watched the craft there weren���������t any planes nor where there any birds. The absence of birds interests me since in my observations since; the area seems full of bird life. The craft lifted higher in the sky and then began to slowly head east. We watched it until it faded from view."],"Summary":"A shiny bright metallic object with a smaller brighter orb.","Date of the Event":"08/03/2010 08:30 UTC","Case Number":"25084","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Gauteng","Longitude":"28.237687","Date Submitted":"08/13/2010 07:49 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Kempton Park","There were no other sightings in Kempton Park on or around August 3rd 2010"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Flash","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-26.107561,+28.237687(25084)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25084) map </A>","Tags":"City","Latitude":"-26.107561","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
