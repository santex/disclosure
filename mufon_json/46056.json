(march 3rd) which i reported. (maybe march 2nd.) the strange blue light showed up again, and closer to us! this time, i had binoculars. sorry to say, it appeared to be a large rc plane, with a w shaped blue light strip under the wing, with i'm guessing, red led wingtips. the light was alot closer to us, and although i couldn't actually make out the plane\\model, it's flight path looked very much like what an rc plane would do. no sounds however. it was maybe 1\\2 to a mile away. i managed to film on my cell camera, which didn't pick up detail. but the binoculars did show details. a ufo congress was in town coincedently, but do not know if it's related. sorry, false alarm! still, i believe they are out there!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
