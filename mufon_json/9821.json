yes!!! that gives me the chills. i feel goosebumps--i do too, i responed. i ask him, was there anything in the sky before you took the picture. he said, there was nothing in the sky and then i placed my phone in the dircetion and could see a ball of light. it move out of my camera's view and only caught the end of it(you can see this object with the camera running and can't see it with your naked eyes) he thought it was his radar detector, so he unplugged it. then put the phone up and caught the ball w\\a big head and tinacals, attach-but to the side of the ball(zoom up, just like my picture that i caught with the 4 green lights.zoomed-looks the same). haven't down loaded images, yet. he's emailing them to me. he also told me that he felt like crying and that his eyes would start watering, when he took the picture and when he thinks about the image that he saw. we have talked on the phone and both of us feel this crying and an intense feeling of somebody watching or staring at you. we feel these tingles and goosebumps. but the intence urge to cry comes on like in waves. i come home @ 8:17p.m.(3-3-08) and stop in front of my driveway and take a picture. i catch the image again, but it is at a farther distance. i can't zoom up enough to get a clear image. it does look like the ball or object thats been caught on camera. these things are watching me, at lease at home. i haven't tried taking pictures at friends houses yet. if you could please send some investigators to check this out, it's a little spooky. aka:the sightings"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
