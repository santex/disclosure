I did not realize it was there until I downloaded the pictures to my computer and took a closer look at the cloud like trail from the object in the upper right hand corner of the picture. It appears to look like something coming in at a high rate of speed. I do not think it is a meteor but not sure. The picture has fairly good resolution and can be blown up to get a better look."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.885464,+-87.623248(37972)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37972) map </A>","Tags":"City"}
