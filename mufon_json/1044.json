{"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI observed the object for over 2 hours. During that time I attempted toasertain why the object seemed to dwell over a specific area. My assumption isthat the object was perhaps over the site of the now decommissioned TrojanNucular Power Plant. I also observed what appeared to be tiny flashbulb typelights both around and moving from below up twards the object. The presence tothese lights was not constant. I observed the lights 4 or 5 times during the 2hours.I would appreciate knowing if you are able to link my observation with anyothers. Thank you."],"Longitude":"-122.816944","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.859444,+-122.816944(1044)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1044) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in St Helens","There were no other sightings in St Helens on or around February 7th 2001"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"02/07/2001 04:00 UTC","Summary":"Unusual object in the sky observed from my home","City":"St Helens","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1044.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/1044.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1044.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Oregon","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"01:59:00","Latitude":"45.859444","Date Submitted":"02/07/2001 04:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Case Number":"1044","Country":"United States"}
