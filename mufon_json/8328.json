It was late at night and I was looking North towards the big dipper. I am a somewhat experienced astronomer and I was observing the stars as it was a very clear night. As I gazed northward, a black, triangular object that flew rather low to the ground flew out from the eastern half of my vision and made a slight southward curve as it crossed the sky directly above me. The craft was completely silent, and completely black, had it not been for the three bright white lights it is possible it would have been invisible. The craft made no noise at all, and made no attempt to hide itself. I first noticed the object because I saw the movement of it's lights against the background of the stationary stars, when I first saw the object I thought it was maybe a shooting star, but I almost immediately realized it could not have been as it had a distinct triangular shape and turned as it flew. After seeing the object I felt strange feelings of spprehension and perhaps a touch of fear and dread. My friend Phil, also saw the same object. I lost sight of the object as it flew behind the treeline."],"City":"Detroit Lakes"}
