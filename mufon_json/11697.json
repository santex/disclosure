{"City":"Phoenix","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile driving I observed an Unknown Object... I had just made an exit from 202E on Priest Drive. I turned right on Priest Drive heading south bound. While I was driving in the left lane at the posted speed limit, with my window down, I saw a very bright white star-like sphere on my left (East) at approximately 1,000 feet above ground level. The object itself was moving in a direction from southeast to the northwest very slowly. The light was constant and there was no strobe visible. The light did not appear to be landing lamps, and there was no visible red navigation light that should have been visible on an aircraft flying in the direction of the object. The object was also flying in an area I would consider dangerous. My reason for this statement is because Sky Harbor traffic was departing the runways to the east at this time. I believe it was not transitioning class Bravo airspace because it was flying too low. ..... Now to continue my sighting. While continuing to view the object, several trees came between me and the object. When this happened, the object was taken out of my view for approximately 2 seconds. Right after the trees had passed, the object was gone. I slowed the vehicle and continued to look constantly for the next several minutes; ever after I turned left on University to head east toward Rural. This was the first time I have ever observed an object like this. Flying and aviation is something that is second nature to me. I am a licensed private pilot, and I was a helicopter crew chief in the Marine Corps. I do not believe that what I observed was phenomenon that was associated with, or can be deduced to weather or optical physics. I had a smile on my face for the next 10 minutes."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/23/2008 09:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/23/2008 09:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.454027","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around July 23rd 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Summary":"Very bright White Star-like object moving slowly - 2 miles East of Sky harbor runway 25R 1,000 feet A.G.L.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11697.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11697.html"],"Case Number":"11697","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.454027,+-112.071537(11697)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11697) map </A>","Longitude":"-112.071537","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-07242008-0004","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like, Unknown"}
