We must have counted like 7 planes all in one area..and like 4 planes in another area..and also random planes just everywhere! Some looked close, most looked far. The planes were a bright blinking light with 2 big red lights. Very strange and weird feeling."],"City":"New York","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"18068","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around June 30th 2009"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.715663,+-74.002543(18068)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18068) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/30/2009 10:39 UTC","Log Number":"US-07142009-0002","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Region":"New York","Latitude":"40.715663","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18068.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18068.html"],"Summary":"About last post.
