The orb seemed to be radiating it's own light from within. It was about the size of a basketball and seemed to be floating through the trees but changed direction and stalled at different times. It was extremely dark on that evening and was absolutely not reflecting moonlight. There was no electric lines where we were. The object was radiating a beautiful bluish hue and we all felt it was under intelligent control. I personally felt that it was aware we were observing it. It sat at the top of a tree around a hundred feet from us and then just blinked off. I just watched your program on TV - Fri. night and the witnesses were observing the exact same object we witnessed in Malaysia all those years ago. I find it very interesting that I witnessed the same object years ago, so many thousands of miles away."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"101.948988","Log Number":"MY-09182009-0015","Region":"Negeri Sembilan","Tags":"City","City":"Seremban","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"10/31/1990 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Softly glowing blue orb","Country":"Malaysia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19381.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19381.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2.718592,+101.948988(19381)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19381) map </A>","Latitude":"2.718592"}
