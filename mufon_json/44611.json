As I pulled into the parking lot which is next to a field I noticed a light in the sky that was, to me, too big and bright to be a star especially at the time I saw it (a little before 5pm twilight). I got out of my truck and used my phone to take a few pictures and was lucky enough to get them as well as a picture of the trail it left before it shot off and disappeared.Unfortunatly no one was with me"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.906487,+-72.743433(44611)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44611) map </A>","Latitude":"40.906487","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-12172012-0013","Region":"New York","Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44611.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44611.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/17/2012 07:19 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Calverton","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-72.743433","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
