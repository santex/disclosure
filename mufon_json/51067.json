{"Region":"Ontario","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsSept 23rd 2013 7:50pm I noticed a bright white light hovering over Scarborough near Eglinton ave and Markham rd . The object sat there for about an hour and a half then desends and slowly moves south at no more then 20 klm. At first I thought satellite but then I noticed a cloud pass behind it and last time I checked planes didn't hover. Sept 24th 2013 at 8pm I noticed the light again repeating the same pattern as the night before. If your in the area look south west and who knows you might see it. Attached are 2 digital photos I took from sept 24th 2013. The first photo shows the starlike object hovering and the 2nd photo shows the object leaving in a west direction towards the DVP."],"Longitude":"-79.379684","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There were no other sightings in Toronto on or around September 23rd 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Toronto","Latitude":"43.655806","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51067.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51067.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/25/2013 11:34 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"Canada","Case Number":"51067","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"CA-09252013-0009","Summary":"2 night white light event","Sighting Duration":"01:30:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.655806,+-79.379684(51067)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51067) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/23/2013 08:00 UTC"}
