I looked at the full moon and there was a star like object in the 4 or 5 o'clock position from the moon. I have never noticed this before. It appeared very close to the moon. It seemed to be still & was slightly yellowish if I remember correctly. When I got home about 20 minutes later it was still there. I went in the house and kind of forgot about it until I read the report from the person in Colorado who saw what sounds like the same thing."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Case Number":"8745","Date of the Event":"12/24/2007 12:00 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
