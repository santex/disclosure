THERE WAS NO TRAILER VISABLE TO ME. THE LIGHT WAS ON THE LANDING APPROACH OF THE MADISON AIRPORT. I HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS PLANES THRU THERE, BUT NEVER NEAR THE SPEED THAT THE LIGHT TRAVELED. AFTER THE BRIEF MOMENT OF THE SIGHTING I TRIED TO FIND SOME LOGIC IN WHAT I SAW. THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD JUDGE THE DISTANCE OR SIZE. THE SIZE, IF IN MY HAND AT ARMS LENGTH, WAS LIKE A ORANGE. ME.. SEEING A UFO CAN'T BE WAS MY THOUGHT AT THE TIME, HOWERVER, JUST WHAT WAS IT?? ANY IDEAS?? MY LOCATION IS MADISON WI. SIGHTING FROM WEST WINDOW AT 110 SCHENK ST.
