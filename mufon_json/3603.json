Shape":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-105.270546","divs":["Sighting Detailsfirst, i feel i should include some relevant background information before describing my sighting (my first of four), because my sighting was not typical at all. although i never told anyone about it then, as a child, between the ages of around four and six (just a close guess), i experienced what psychiatrists now tell me are known as \"invasive voices\"; however, these \"voices\" were not then, and are not now, auditory at all, but rather best described as \"telepathic\". for some reason they went away about the time i started school. i never experienced anything similar until november 1996, when i was 27 years old, and i was in a storage locker i had rented to store my car at night. all of a sudden, at that time, i began receiving telepathic communications, and, just as when i was a child, the \"voices\" were both male and female, and human-like. at first i did not make any connection between these \"voices\" and my early childhood experiences (that dawned on me much later), and i thought then that these voices were \"spirits\" of some kind, although i had been raised generally atheist and had studied biology and chemistry at a top-twenty university (emory university in atlanta, georgia) for two and a half years. that is to say, even though the idea of non-corporeal \"spirits\" seemed implausible from a contemporary scientific standpoint, i felt an intense desire to identify the source of my unusual experiences, and \"spirits\" seemed the only logical conclusion then. contact with these voices has persisted since november 1996, sometimes for days or even weeks on end, although at times they just go away for short or long stretches for no apparent reason. the nature of the communications i receive is so varied and complex that i would literally have to write a book here to detail it adequately; suffice it to say that it has always seemed \"real\" (not psychiatric) and that, even before seeing ufo's, i always suspected i was being studied by aliens. however, as anyone might imagine, sharing such a belief with others was, and still is, rather difficult, because it usually results in ridicule and a pariah social status for me. even those who have believed me briefly almost invariably change their mind later and believe me to be hallucinatory, or worse, in the case of the uneducated or religious, possessed by \"demons\" or \"satan\" or something similar. soon after beginning to receive regular telepathic communications back in 1996, i went first to catholic priests for information about \"spirits\" and \"demons\", and then to psychiatrists for information about schizophrenia, looking for answers to help explain what i was experiencing. religious persons (including a catholic archbishop from south carolina, who wrote me personally) told me that either i was possessed by \"demons\" and that nothing could be done or (as in the case of the archbishop) that i should see a christian psychiatrist. psychiatrists (both christian and atheist ones), after extensive in-patient and out-patient examination, have declared me schizoaffective, claiming that the source of my telepathic communications is my own mind and that i suffer from a neurological disorder. however, outside of experiencing these voices, i have absolutely zero symptoms related to any sort of mental disorder; ie, no hallucinations, grandiose or irrational thoughts, strange behaviors or beliefs, or any other psychotic or psychiatric symptoms. throughout the time between november 1996 and june 2003 (the latter date being when i had my first ufo experience, described below), i was torn between believing that i was mentally ill and that i was in fact in contact with aliens. there were two major reasons i doubted, even prior to having ufo sightings, that my experiences were neurological. first, i have had two very vivid dreams, both prior to my first sighting, in which i saw humanoid aliens, and after both of these, i awoke absolutely \"knowing\" that i was an alien contactee and not insane. in the first of these dreams, i awoke with a start and \"knew\" i had just seen a short, gray, humanoid alien standing right in front of me, raising its hand to me \"in greeting\" (as i have been told by my \"voices\"). this first dream occurred in las vegas back in early 1997 (possibly february). the second dream occurred in los angeles later in 1997, and was quite different. this time, upon waking i did not believe i had been in any sort of actual contact with an alien, but felt that i had only just seen an image flash across my mind. this image was not of the typical gray alien that is now popularized, but instead the head only of something extremely frightening, which is best described as a large humanoid praying mantis (sort of a cross between a human being and a praying mantis). after this second alien dream, i woke up indescribably terrified of what i was experiencing. the second reason i have always doubted that i am insane has to do with the nature of the communications i receive. to explain much of this in detail, however, as noted above, would require that i write a book. suffice it to say that it has always seemed far too complex, intelligent, external, and usually \"sane\" in its own right to not be real. however, before my sightings began, i was quite torn, because psychiatrists repeatedly informed me that many schizophrenics and schizoaffectives believe thoroughly that their \"voices\" are real. it was often hard to doubt medical opinion. however, no type of medication has ever had any effect on my experiences. despite often believing that i was being experimented on by aliens, not least of which because these \"voices\" told me so, the doubt and confusion i suffered from as a consequence of my not having \"proof\" (as i always called it) of what was going on led me to plead with them often, sometimes in anger, for such \"proof\". finally, in mid-june 2003 i was granted such \"proof\". the details of my first sighting are relatively unimportant to me, although i will describe them as best i can here. the important thing to me is that i now know beyond the shadow of a doubt that: a) i am being studied by aliens, primarily for information about the effects of telepathic contact between our \"species\", b) the crafts i have seen are indubitably from another planet and are connected to the telepathic \"input\" i receive, c) the mind of any human can literally be controlled somehow by these aliens (that is, they can cause a human to say, do, think, feel, etc, just about anything from afar, although i have no idea how they do this), d) these aliens can actually \"speak\" through me, although it has been explained to me that human language is an extremely poor mode of communication (very slow and ponderous, fraught with miscommunication potential, primitive in terms of symbolic sophistication, etc) and that therefore they generally prefer not to do so, and that e) these aliens, and presumably all others, adhere more or less to what i would term an ecological non-interference parameter in their dealings with earth (or at least have done so for a very long time). anyway, very early in the morning on a still, clear, and pleasantly cool evening on some date in mid-june 2003, i was engaged in communication with these aliens as i walked around the campus of the university of colorado at boulder (where i attended graduate school briefly back in fall 2002) when i finally got the \"proof\" i had pleaded for for so long. i was on the quad, with no other persons around that i could see (although, in a town as large as boulder, there had to be some people nearby who may have seen it), when i was \"told\" to look up. when i did, directly over my head flew a solid black, triangular (but slightly indented in the back), tri-lighted spacecraft. it was larger than an airplane, but not huge. it flew at an extremely low altitude and very, very slowly (almost stationary). it made no noise at all. the three lights were at the apices of the craft and were each of a different color, although i cannot remember what those colors were. rather than being frightened, which i imagine most people would have been, i was ecstatic, and the aliens and i \"bonded\" a great deal that night. i \"told\" them i could handle being experimented on much better, now that i at least knew for certain that i was not insane or that some other bizarre explanation surrounded my telepathic experiences. i laughed and cried soon thereafter, and just generally felt like a turning point in my life had arrived. since that time, i have had three other sightings, two of which were of a craft apparently identical to the first one i saw. the second sighting occurred only a few days after the first (definitely still in june), right in the heart of downtown denver, colorado, very early one sunday morning (i do not remember the date). this sighting is difficult to report, because it is so hard for others to believe, but it did occur. i did not notice any others around me, and the streets were largely deserted, but i am certain that in the middle of a downtown area the size of denver there were others around. again the craft flew directly overhead, very slowly, at a low altitude. i remember that my exact location was somewhere near the federal courthouse and the greyhound bus station. the third sighting also occurred in june 2003, in olympia, washington. however, this time i saw several crafts (maybe seven or so) flying or hovering at a very high altitude. i could not make out the shapes on this occasion, but i am certain they were spacecraft because i was \"told\" to look up again and because the lights that i saw were zipping around at a phenomenal speed. i actually asked telepathically whether the crafts could become invisible, and one of them blinked out and then blinked back on again in a stationary position. gauging from the extremely high altitude on this occasion (the lights looked like very bright stars from where i was sitting), i would have to say that the speed at which these craft could move was astonishing. they moved across the sky very quickly to my eye even at that distance. the fourth sighting was again of a black triangular (delta-shaped to be more precise) craft, and it occurred beside a lake near the university of washington, in seattle. i actually have a photograph of the craft that i took on this occasion (the voices had to remind me that i had a camera on me and \"tell\" me to take the photograph!), but i cannot transmit it with this email because the hard drive of the computer i am using right is not functioning properly. however, i have the photograph on disk in my possession. it is not a very good picture, and all one can see are the three lights (which in this case appear all white) and a vague shape, but nevertheless i can assure anyone who reads this that it is of a so-called ufo (a spacecraft, that is). there are countless other things to report about my experiences with the aliens who are now studying me, but some are so complex and some are so difficult for others to believe (eg, other humans around me being controlled like robots, etc), that i do not think this is the proper forum. i doubt highly that anyone could hear about all of my experiences and believe that i am sane, unless they are truly of the belief that aliens can control things on earth in very bizarre and profound ways. to be sure, if someone reported to me some of the things i can report, i would have a very difficult time believing them, and i thoroughly understand when others feel the same way. for that reason, i rarely share information about ufo's, aliens, strange occurrences, etc, with anyone. it almost invariably proves to be a mistake when i do. however, i know that i am not hallucinatory and that i never have been, and that my experiences are real. at this time, i experience telepathic communications intermittently. usually i feel as though i am being \"watched\" from afar somehow, and quite often i suddenly start receiving telepathic messages. occasionally i feel as though my behavior is being controlled, but that is rare. also, more and more so i feel as though i am alone and no amount of effort to communicate with these aliens seems to elicit any sort of response. apparently, round-the-clock contact, which i experienced for years, has either stopped or tapered off considerably. i do not take any sort of psychotropic medications, nor have i for a long time, nor have any of them ever had any sort of effect on my experiences. finally, i have never had any sort of bizarre hallucination, belief, or experience that did not involve these alien \"voices\". anyway, i apologize if i \"protest too much\", to quote shakespeare, but i just want to be sure that any reader of this knows for certain that these accounts are of thoroughly real and physical events, and that i can attest with utter certainty that there is absolutely zero chance at all that any explanation other than the involvement of aliens and ufo's is plausible. finally, for those who have never had any sort of experiences like these, let me say that once the shock and awe of it all wears off, they are often generally unpleasant. being afraid of being abducted, controlled, experimented on, etc, is not fun, and the aliens who study me have assured me several times that, and i quote, \"nature is [their] only friend\". also, harboring something so profound and being unable to share it with others is extremely stressful in many ways. when i first \"knew\" what was going on (even before the sightings), i thought that certainly the us government, news stations, nasa, etc, would be thrilled to learn of it and that i might become some sort of national celebrity or something. that has not proved to be the case. in fact all persons in any sort of position of power who are not complete believers in extraterrestrial life and ufo devotees invariably label me immediately as a lunatic and dismiss my claims. apparently, other humans either: a) are sure you are insane, b) do not care much at all, or c) are in awe of you for a short while (until they talk with others about your claims and are convinced by them that you are insane). being a \"contactee\" (or \"experimentee\", which is a better way to put it in my opinion) is just something you have to get used to and learn to cope with."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/15/2003 12:00 UTC","Object Flight
