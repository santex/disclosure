{"City":"Juno Beach","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting on the beach with a friend. We saw what we thought was a shooting star appear almost overhead... but then it suddenly stopped still. Then is started moving again in the opposite direction. It turned and flew all around the sky, moving faster at times than any aircraft I've ever seen... and other times slowly wobbling back and forth in one place. The light from it was brighter than a star and we compared its movements to that of a bumblebee flying around a garden. It was flying around like this for about 15 minutes while we watched, until it got dimmer (farther away) and the movements less drastic... and then it was gone."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32757.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32757.html"],"Summary":"Brighter than a star... moved around the sky like a bumblebee dancing around.
