Thier it was HUGE, about the size of the Super Dome. The cloud cover was at 23,00 ft that day and this was below the clouds.There where also strong winds that day, and I believe that there was a small aircraft adviery, due to the winds. It stayed in place, on a wobble. Whent into another curve while driving and looked back to see it again and it was gone. This object was shinny silver, like a mirror. It was also near a power plant, accros the road. It also had a wobble to it. All I can think is it was tapping free electrons from the power plant."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26978.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26978_submitter_file1__UFO.jpeg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26978.html"],"Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"07/31/2001 06:00 UTC","Case Number":"26978","Latitude":"34.955996","Summary":"looked like a metal hamburger","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
