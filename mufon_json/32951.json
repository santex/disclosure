It then curved slightly to the South for several degrees before returning to its original Eastward direction. It then stopped abruptly and did not move again. This star was fairly dim and not very noticeable. Total travel was around 10 degrees. It was nearly directly overhead and looked like any other normal star before during and after movement. I went inside to warm up and returned outside for a check on the stars position. Being as the star was so dim, I could no longer find it among the other stars, so its location was now uncertain. At this point I checked the green Southern star that I had seen move the previous night. It appeared in its normal position and had tracked through its normal range of movement, at least as far as I could tell."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Small red star moved in non star like manner.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32951.html"],"City":"Kingman","Date Submitted":"10/30/2011 02:26 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
