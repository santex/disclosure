{"Longitude":"-94.407377","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy family and I were at a Fourth of July party with family and friends talking and enjoying the fireworks, when my fiance' saw something in the sky. We all looked up and saw two orange glowing spheres flying very slowly going from North to South. They flew in a general straight path that wavered somewhat as they moved slightly up and down while moving. This lasted about 45 seconds to one minute before they both just faded away one after another. They were bright and very distinct. If I held something up in the air at arm's length it would be about the size of a pea. we were all amazed at what we saw. There were about 35 people that witnessed this. I'm still stunned from this event. They spheres did not act like a plane or helicopter. I called this in to Margie Kay at Kansas City MUFON and she said to file a report."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17888.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17888.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 10:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 10:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Two glowing orange spheres moving south in a straight pattern, one following the other.
