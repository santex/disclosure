We all looked into the sky and we saw these orange star like objects flying high in the sky, traveling all at the same speed, in the same direction in no apparrent formation. When i first notciced the objects i thourt that it may be some kind of planes flying but then roughy a hundred of them all appeared from nowhere. We ALL saw them and i even called my family to tell them, they looked and saw exactly what we all saw outside the party...hundreds of orange spots, moving at a steady speed in the sky. After watching the objects move for many minuites they all started to dissappear when they reached a certain place in the sky. I had never seen anythink like this before, all of us stared in curosity and fasination. Something else...all the animals and pets down the street and round the area all made noises, as though they were petrified. I tried to video this event on my mobilephone, but iut was too dark to pick anything up. If anyone has witnesed another event just like this, please notify me ans it will be most helpful and interesting, thankyou."],"City":"London","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"51.510569"}
