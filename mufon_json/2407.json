My friend thought this was a plane at first altho I did not, atfirst I thought this was a trangle shaped craft. When I pointed out to him thatit could not be a plane, because it would have been huge, he suggested perhapsthe lights were jets flying in a three man formation. I realized it could bethat and then after this formation went over, it suddenly stopped. All threelights just stopped and they did not move again. There were no sounds, if youhad looked at the sky without knowing they had been moving, they appearedexactly like stars. We tried to figure out what would fly over like that andthen suddenly just stop. They were still sitting there like that after twohours, I know we tried to figure out what they were, I wondered if satillitescould be have been being moved into postition."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2407.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2407.html"]}
