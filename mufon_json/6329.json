In the distance I saw one red round light in the sky. Then another light came on as the 1st red light turned off. this happened until there was approx 5-6 lights in a row lit up and then off, then it would go back to the 1st light, light up, then off, then on to the next light beside. (I knew this was an ufo, Ive seen them before back in NV). This lasted about 2-3 minutes, and the lights just stopped. After the event and in less then 90 seconds aiforce jets flew over and around the area where I saw the ufo. My feelings were very intense that I just saw a ufo. This siting was much clearer then the one I saw in NV."],"Longitude":"-121.52111","Date Submitted":"03/05/2005 08:00 UTC","Case Number":"6329","Summary":"5+ bright lights hover, lights on and off.
