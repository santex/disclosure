Suddenly one of them dissappeared and right after the other did. As we watched they would dim and slowly come back, then dissapear over and over. During all this I was on the phone with my brother 30 miles away in Glenwood Springs and as I was freaking out over the phone he decided to check out the sky as well. Amazingly enough he and his roommate saw the same lights flying over head. In this 30 mile radius is rough terrain and high mountains, there is no way it could have been airplanes seen in both these locations."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"19165","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19165.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19165.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09082009-0038","Date of the Event":"09/08/2009 08:53 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Glenwood Springs","There were no other sightings in Glenwood Springs on or around September 8th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/08/2009 11:33 UTC","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","City":"Glenwood Springs","Country":"United States","Summary":"2 white lights flying overhead","Longitude":"-107.317986"}
