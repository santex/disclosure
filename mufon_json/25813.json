{"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["sighting detailswalking on the beach with my son when we looked up at a plane that was flying overhead. i noticed way above the plane about 20 glimmering( it was actually strange, kind of like they were wavering\\fluttering) spheres in a \"v\" formation. at first thought they were geese heading south for the winter but then realized they were way to high for that. as i was watching i noticed that they also stayed in place without moving. i thought this was strange so i kept watching. after about 10 seconds they suddenly went from a \" v\" formation to a circle and started moving slowly south. they then changed from a circle to a straight line while still moving south. after about 10-15 seconds in a straight line they simply vanished."],"Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-10112010-0008","Summary":"approx 20 silver spheres","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.964786,+-70.657652(25813)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25813) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Plymouth","There were no other sightings in Plymouth on or around October 10th 2010"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/10/2010 09:00 UTC","Region":"Massachusetts","Case Number":"25813","Date Submitted":"10/11/2010 10:55 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25813.html"],"Longitude":"-70.657652","Country":"United States","City":"Plymouth","Latitude":"41.964786"}
