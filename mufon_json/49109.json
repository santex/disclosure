I was scanning the sky getting ready to fire up Google Sky Map on my phone when I noticed this point of light moving in a NE direction towards DIA. My boss was with me and we watched it travel across the sky, I mentioned the lack of any flashing lights like you would see on an airplane wondering if I was just seeing airplane landing lights. The object was traveling slow and steady and I followed it until it was low on the horizon and blocked by buildings and trees. I studied it intensely to be sure it was not an airplane because this could be the third UFO I have seen in my lifetime."],"Case Number":"49109","Latitude":"39.782844","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49109.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49109.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/21/2013 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"07/22/2013 02:05 UTC","Summary":"Slow and steady point of light no strobe lights observed like an airplane would have","City":"Denver","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-105.006243","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around July 21st 2013"],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
