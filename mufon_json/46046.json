The time was 2:5? Something in the morning. I seen about 7 meteors when my count was interrupted by 2 red orange glowing objects( which I believe to be apart of one unit). I am a Field Investigator for MUFON so I am aware of the UFO phenomenon. I got excited and fumbled for my binoculars. I tried to locate it twice with no luck. I was too nervous and shaky. I did not notice an outline of a body or structure. It disappeared into the distance and not over the horizon. I went inside afterwards and wrote everything down. The time was 3:15 am."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46046.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46046.html"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"39.757467","Date of the Event":"12/14/2012 03:15 UTC","Case Number":"46046","Log Number":"US-03052013-0012","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Summary":"I was laying back watching the meteor show when I saw a glowing red orange object moving across the sky.","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"St. Joseph","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.757467,+-94.800838(46046)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46046) map </A>","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/05/2013 04:26 UTC"}
