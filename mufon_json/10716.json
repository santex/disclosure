recording system. i have been documenting plasma and ufo phenomena with my celestron 8 inch newtonian reflector video system. most of this data was taken looking west from my house in sandia heights on the edge of the sandia mountains. please visit my youtube site to view the 10 music videos that i have made documenting this research. http:\\\\www.youtube.com\\portigalf i decided to get a different perspective looking east towards the sandia mountains from the western desert. i arrived at the site about 3 miles north west of petroglyph national park at about 7:30 pm and set up my telescope system. at about 8:15 pm i noticed a very bright \"star\" to the south at an elevation of about 30 degrees. there were a few things that were very odd about this star: my background is in geophysics and i am an expert in the field of imaging spectroscopy. i routinely use forward models of the atmosphere to remove the absorption and scattering effects of the atmosphere so that this \"hyperspectral\" data can be analyzed. this technical background informs the following analysis: 1) the optical depth at this slant elevation obscured the star field due to scattering and absorption so that this \"star\" was the only one visible in the sky. 2) the spectral emission of this star was uncharacteristic of stars that i have observed. there were high frequency variations of highly saturated colors from blue all the way through red. 3) the area of the star viewed through the c8 ngt was much larger than typical stars. i later calculated the area to be about 1000 connected pixels in contrast to the typical star in this telescope between 30-50 pixels. thus it was 20-30 times bigger than any star i have observed. the \"star\" was moving slowly to the west as stars do in the night sky so i had to move the telescope every few minutes to keep the \"star\" in the field of view (fov). i recorded about 90 minutes before my power supply ran out of juice. i spent the next month processing the first 10 minutes of this data to produce the video on my youtube site called \"plasma ufo mothership\", aka \"space time metro\". these are the processing steps used to produce this video and the telescope frames included with this report: 1) the motion of the \"star\" in each pass through the fov was tracked and removed to cause the device to remain stationary. 2) the device was then enlarged to fill the video frame using the pan function in the software. 3) the primary means of camouflage used by the device is radiant intensity designed to saturate most video and still cameras. once saturated there is nothing that can be done to eliminate this obscuration. when setting up the recording i made sure that the ccd was not saturated by manually backing off the intensity by reducing the gain. this was the key to my successful defeat of the devices primary camouflage. i adjusted the intensity, saturation and hue for the each clip to maximize the contrast revealing the inner workings of the device as well as the many space craft that were detected within the \"star\". 4) i applied a high spatial frequency pass filter to improve the detailed structures within the device. after inspecting the 20,000 frames in the first 10 minutes (20% of the data) that i have had time to analyze, the best examples of space craft and detailed device inner workings were extracted. the video starts out with a 200 mm nikon image of the \"star\" to give you the frame of reference for the subsequent video. then you will see the device as a still telescope frame followed by an enlargement. this sets the stage for the 30 hz video data with the first minute without contrast\\filter improvement with a linear ramp to full analysis mode. the first half of the video data shows high frequency variation of the internal structure of the device. the second half are selected telescope video frames extended in time so that you can see the various space craft in detail. observations: after careful review of this data here are my observations: 1) this is a very sophisticated device, likely of extraterrestrial origin. 2) this is without a doubt not a star. 3) space vehicles appear within the device as compact forms and transform into recognizable shapes moving out of the plasma field. 4) space vehicles arrive at the device, move into the interior and mutate into compact forms before disappearing. 5) the inner workings of the device appear to be like a giant computer motherboard. 6) this motherboard varies in configuration at a very high frequency, much greater than video frame rates. 7) the device camouflages itself using a combination of radiant energy and strategic placement to appear star-like. analysis (my opinion): 1) this device is a massive transit portal moving space vehicles to and from the city of albuquerque new mexico. 2) it is probably connected to larger devices in space for interstellar transport or other similar devices in the earths atmosphere in other locations. 3) this portal is probably a synthetic wormhole allowing undetected transport over great distances. 4) this device is related to a companion video \"plasma ufo wormhole\" that documents surface portals that serve as near surface metro stations connected to the mothership. i will submit a second report of this surface component of the mass transit system that is used to move space vehicles without detection. please see the attached video frames and visit my youtube site so see the video \"plasma ufo mothership\" aka \"space time metro.
