They were flying in a straight line and looked as if connected by a cord. The second converged on the front one until they were indistinguishable from each other. The red lights on the front 4 turned to a light white. The fifth in line appeared to be a plane and fell back from the others, its lights now furiously blinking red. The front 4 (well we only actually saw the 3 after the front 2 converged) turned left in a 45 degree angle and looked as f they were descending. The back plane like apparatus did not turn but still followed. They all disappeared. The sky was light and the clouds looked frozen. Now the sky is black and cloudless. There was no sound emitted."],"Summary":"5 Connected Red Lights","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Vero Beach","There was one other sighting in Vero Beach on or around April 5th 2012"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
