Followed by a second a few minutes apart.","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-71.651608","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas outside with our dogs watching the sky as we saw a couple of shooting stars to see a strange red ball of red move swiftly in a perfect straight line across the sky. The object did not leave a trail or flicker it just kept colour and line and speed of movement until out of sight. A few minutes later a second identical object moved along the same flight path. Both objects were identical and were 100% not a plane, we live close to flight paths and know what a plane in the sky looks like. These objects left both my wife and I, and my mother who also witnessed the objects, lost for an explanation as to what we saw.
