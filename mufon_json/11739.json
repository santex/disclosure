{"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/14/1995 09:22 UTC","Region":"California","divs":["sighting detailswhile driving east on i-10 freeway, i observed a very shocking sight over the mountains to my north. while watching it i pointed it out to my wife and daughter and looked for a place to safely pull over. i stopped at a wide spot on the eastbound onramp from 4th street to i-10. i got out and saw a dirigible shaped ufo moving from behind the peak of a mountain at a distance of about 13 miles. i am a military and commercial pilot with over 25 years of experience. the object was so huge it was impossible for me to see what i was observing from as it was approximately 1\\2 mile (3000 ft) in length and 400 to 450 feet in diameter. this is incredible to see something so huge in the air) the ends were hemispherical in shape and ever-so-slightly eliptical in shape. the surface was as shiny as a milar balloon. the visibilty, this morning, was between 50-70 miles minimum as i could clearly see the peaks of mt san jacinto and mt. san gregornio, to the east, and there were no clouds a all from horizon to horizon. in miltary terms it was severe-clear. i could see in the reflection, of the surface of the object, movement of terrain below the object. i could see the terrain with roads or gullies and other objects reflected. the strange thing is that the ground reflections were being superimposed on the upper surfaces of the object and the sky was being reflected on the lower surfaces of the object. this would be exactly opposite for any reflective surface to do and had to be projected by technology, unknown at the time, on the opposite sides of the craft. the curved ends of the surface distorted the images as any curved surface would but the reflections were clear, as if in a mirror, not a polished metalic\\aluminum skin. the craft was flying level and quite slow - perhaps 30-35 mph and did not maneuver from a straight course. we watched the object move left to right until the rear end cleared the peak on the left and then traveled the distance between the two major peaks where it started to disappear behind the right-hand peak. we watched it until it completely disappeared behind the peak on the east. we were enroute to my wife's mother's home for mother's day and i advised them of the sightings and saw their reaction of wonder. i was reluctant to discuss it with anyone else, at the time, due to the incredulity of the enormous size of the object and probability of becoming ridiculed. i am a retired army officer with 21 years service. i am a trained observer, as an officer and a pilot, and i know what i saw was absolutely not man- made. it had no apparent means of propulsion, left no sign it had passed, and did not appear again to me. recently i witnessed video footage of a sighting over colorado of a similarly shaped object. the size of the object was approximately a ratio of seven to one as to length and width. the surface was perfectly smooth - without distortion - and cylindrical in shape except for the ends. the difference between this one and the colorado video is that the one i saw was mirror-surfaced and the one in the colorado sighting appeared white against a blue sky. the ratio was so similar in both that i felt compelled to report this to you as it might fit into other sightings of the time and provide a new impression. i have since been back to the spot and have taken gps readings at the place we observed it from and a magnetic azimuth of the direction to the object which i have recorded. i have only had one other sighting of a ufo, in my life, as a boy scout in idaho in oct. 1956 and that sighting was documented by the goc (civil ground observer corps)and us air force operations i was working for as a volunteer. i would be happy to discuss this one also if interested. it was declared a ufo by the af observers on duty and f-89 aircraft were scrambled from fairchild afb to attempt an intercept with it, over washington state, a few minutes following our sighting in boise."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.068694,+-117.644388(11739)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11739) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11739.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11739.html"],"Longitude":"-117.644388","Latitude":"34.068694","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Ontario","There were no other sightings in Ontario on or around May 14th 1995"],"City":"Ontario","Case Number":"11739","Summary":"I & my wife and daughter watched a gigantic UFO over the mountains north of us on a very clear day.","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07252008-0022","Object Shape":"Cigar","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:18:00","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/14/1995 09:22 UTC"}
