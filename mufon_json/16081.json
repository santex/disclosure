I was looking up at the clear starry night. when looking to the north I had seen a bright high flying object. that was slowly dimming and moving in a north by north west direction. the object was flying higher then any passenger plane in the area flies. the object had faded out to a reddish brown pin point then to nothing I could see with the nacket eye. this object did not have any airplane strobe lights on it. and judging speed and altitude it was at lease 60,000 ft high in the sky if not more."]}
