{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","divs":["Sighting Detailsjust stepped out for lunch. fast moving and reflecting the sun. first thought was fighter jet headed to mitchel airport. Object was moving at very fast rate then descended sharply without changing attitude pitch or inverting before dive. I was sure, wish i had time to get my binoculars. object moved over horizon. I was south and east of object with noon sun high overhead which gave this object the reflective look. If we dont report this stuff we will never know."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Pleasant Prairie","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Pleasant Prairie","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48074.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48074.html"],"Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.553075,+-87.933412(48074)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48074) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"06/11/2013 10:44 UTC","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile","Country":"United States","Region":"Wisconsin","Longitude":"-87.933412","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/11/2013 12:37 UTC","Latitude":"42.553075","Case Number":"48074","Summary":"MOVING FAST DESCENDED FAST AND MOVED OVER HORIZON","Log Number":"US-06112013-0030","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
