Since that report I have seen the same thing happen twice again. I smoke a pipe in the evening, so I am out on my porch a few times each night between 8pm and 11pm. Three times now I have seen this small white speck that looks at first like a satellite high in the night sky that suddenly glows to a brilliant whitish blue like a helicopter spotlight then dims again and moves off away from us. I have considered that it may be some sort of energy flash from an actual satellite when it is repositioned or something...but I'm not sure that there is such a satellite out there. I have also considered it may be a very large solar panel that is reflecting the sun...but it is always at a different time and the last time I say it it was traveling in the opposite direction from the first time. We don't know what it is, but it is unusual. Anyone have an idea?"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Yucaipa","There were no other sightings in Yucaipa on or around August 15th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Another bright light high in the night sky...","Date of the Event":"08/15/2009 10:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","City":"Yucaipa","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18952.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18952.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Region":"California","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.042175,+-117.041406(18952)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18952) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None"}
