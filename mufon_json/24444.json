It was colorful, round in shape, silent and moved closer to me for a brief moment, then backed away. It turned on its side several times and looked more saucer shaped, then back to hover in its original state which was round. My daughter in law and son took video clips of it. In the video you can see that it was moving around. At one time when it came in closer, it disappeared and at the same time, the battery on my still camera and my son's video camera went dead. After about 60 seconds, it reappeared, and both of our cameras began working again."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Naples","There were no other sightings in Naples on or around July 8th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24444","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24444.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24444.html"],"Summary":"Observed large pulsating colorful hovering object for two consecutive nights that moved toward me and then backed away.
