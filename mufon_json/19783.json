She stated she saw 7 total but I only saw four by the time I parked he Van. They were moving slowly from South to North and back. Two broke away and came East over Fort Collins but returned to meet back with the others. We parked the Van on a remote country road to watch for 30 minutes. I wish I had broght my camera or zoom binociars in with me but I did not. With sunset not too far away an hour or less we had a great reflection off all objects. These are by far the largest UFOs I have seen to date and remind me of the ones that flew over Tucson Feb 15, 2009 . My daughters first so she will remember forever at age 10. I wonder why seeing them from our angle was so easy yet wonder why something this large cannot be seen from below perspective. There was a slight hase of polution in the air but not enough to mask these objects at the size. I had groceries to get home so we left hoping there would be others reporting on these from other locations. Maybe people just don't look up too often at the sky especially in the day time. I also noticed we had almost a full moon and wonder if the UFOs leverage this to their advantage on these nights."],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.453862","City":"Glenn Haven","Date of the Event":"10/02/2009 05:30 UTC","Longitude":"-105.449087","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
