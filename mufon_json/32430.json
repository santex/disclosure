The object was stationary for a split second then shot upward in an eastward direction and disappeared leaving an arced trail that quickly faded away. We live in the flight path for Kansas City International Airport and often see jets ascending after take off and decending for landing and, thus, see the lights on these aircraft. The light seen this morning was much much lower and brighter than any of the lights we've seen on any of the aircraft related to the airport. Also, this light was stationary for a fraction of a second then shot upward and to the east leaving an arced trail of light. The trail light appeared to fall upon fading away. My husband and I are extremely excited because this is our first viewing of a UFO. We were also not aware that other recent sitings in the Kansas City area had been reported."],"City":"Kansas City","Tags":"City","Summary":"Stationary bright orb shot upward & in NE direction leaving arced trail.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.12519,+-94.670172(32430)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32430) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10072011-0018","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32430.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32430.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/07/2011 04:49 UTC","Case Number":"32430"}
