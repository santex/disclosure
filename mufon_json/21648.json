There was no sound from it at all. It was moving north to south and I saw a few little bright balls of light appear at either side of the object briefly, a couple of times. I ran to keep it in view as it moved behind tall trees and it kept going then disappeared before my eyes, but not as if it had disappeared into the distance, but all it once while it was still large looking. I am familiar with the satellites that go over here, and this was different."],"City":"Keaau","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Good sized golden sphere, silent, disappeared.","Case Number":"21648","Date Submitted":"01/26/2010 12:04 UTC","Country":"United States"}
