I was heading down Turkey creek road to Dr. M.L.K. Jr blvd (or state road 574) and I spotted an object floating in the sky. It was near a airport so at first I did not think anything about it, but as I came closer to where it was hovering I realised that this thing looked something like what an asteroid would look like, flaming, sputtering fire and just hovering there. I honestly thought it was a meteor or something along those lines at first, but seen that it was not moving. I wish I had a camera to take pictures of it but I didn't have one in the car nor do I have a cell phone. I stopped to get gas in my car at the CITGO on M.L.K. jr blvd and watched it until it sort of drifted upward and then completely disappeared. I have never seen anything like it, nor did I know that UFO's can be in fireball form until I looked it up online."],"Latitude":"28.006016","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-12212012-0004","Summary":"Fireball craft hovering & smoldering like flame","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/21/2012 09:44 UTC","Longitude":"-82.174566","Object Features":"Unknown"}
