I viewed an amber color object slowly moving across the sky between 1000ft and what ever the reported cloud level was at the time of the sighting. The reason I am sure of the altitude is that an airplane (airliner e.g. a B-717) appeared to be at traffic pattern altitude downwind for rwy 24 at RSW. If that object was on radar that object would be at the aircrafts 12-3 O'clock high position. There were four other objects prior before said aircraft entered the pattern. All five objects were about two and a half minutes apart like they were all following each other. They then disappeared as they ascended into the clouds. There were no navigation lgts (e.g. red, green or white and no strobes.) I am a professional in the aviation industry and I was unable to idenify what characteristic(s) it was. If it was a FAA approved aircraft it had non-standard lighting. This is the first time I have witnessed a UFO(s)."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Florida","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35508.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35508.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:30","Log Number":"US-02052012-0039","Date Submitted":"02/05/2012 11:17 UTC","Summary":"viewed a total of five amber lights at one at a time about 2 min apart coming from the SE to the NW","City":"Iona","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/05/2012 10:01 UTC","Case Number":"35508","Latitude":"26.506443","Longitude":"-81.973316","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON"}
