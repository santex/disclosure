(policeman) these sightings were also bright lights but weren't real high in the sky. there were on flashing lights or any noise. in two of these sightings the object seemed to be hovering in the sky until it seemed like it knew i was watching it and took off across the sky at very high rate of speed, again there was no sound or any other lights flashing or blinking, just one bright light. the other sighting was just a bright light moving across the sky from west to east, no sound or any other blinking or flashing lights. i was in the military, on an aircraft carrier so i know what planes and helicopters sound and look like. and over the years as a police officer i have observed thousands of airplanes and helicopters while on the night shift. these objects i observed did not resemble any aircraft i know of."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Looked like a star moving slowly across sky then just stopped.","Date Submitted":"05/03/2012 09:30 UTC","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.205942,+-77.193315(37889)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37889) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
