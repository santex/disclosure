Saw at least 4 military jets with contrails all going in 4 different directions surrounding the fluttering and jerking descending object. Had to pull in to park intending to take video and it disappeared from sight and the jets kept flying around where it was when I saw it. It was kind of triangular but had almost like a faucet handle form as well. these jets were definitely watching the object and very closely. Disappeared in less than a minute. looked like it was dropping almost out of control but disappeared.There is no doubt in my mind the jets were watching it closely and the contrails were on all four side of the object. I was very upset that when I parked my car it had disappeared. Amazing sighting that I will never forget."],"Country":"United States"}
