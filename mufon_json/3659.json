Ahead of me I noticed what appeared to be a purplish, very bright light about six feet above the ground, about the size of a baseball, two hundred feet away. I measured this distance when I got back from work. Anyway, my first reaction was to lower my glasses, thinking it was some kind of refraction. The purplish ball did not move. I stopped, interested but not worried. The ball went from hovering to incredible speed, passing over my left shoulder within a few feet within a second. I can't estimate the speed, so fast. I actually ducked within a second after it has passed. I then looked up but could not see it. I looked around to see if anyone else possibly could have seen this. Two men were loading a sofa into a pickup about a half-block back, but they were oblivious, busy. I know this sounds crazy, but it happened. Again, no saucer, no green people, but this was real."],"Summary":"Purplish Ball of Light hovering then moving at incredible speed","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-120.547151"}
