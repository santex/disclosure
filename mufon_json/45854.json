{"Object Shape":"Cylinder","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis happened at roughly 4pm yesterday over OKC. I was at hefner and penn area in my car. I saw this object leaving a contrail but when i looked close was clearly huge. I had to lok up at roughly 50 degrees to follow it as it constantly changed course and speed It also left a contrail from both sides of the object and i would estimate it was at roughly 40 to 50,0000 ft height. It was traveling in a sw direction and if the true south direction was where i was at looking south then it was roughly 10 degrees off south. I was able to follow the object for about 5 minutes before i lost sight of it. Since i am ex military and was a drill sergeant to boot i knew instantly this was not a aircraft of any sort i am aware of. Once i lost sight of the object when i went behind a building i lost sight of it and even when i came out from behind i did not see it again."],"trends":["There have been 78 other sightings in Oklahoma City","There were no other sightings in Oklahoma City on or around January 23rd 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-97.579045","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Oklahoma","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.545856,+-97.579045(45854)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45854) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"35.545856","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45854.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45854.html"],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"cylindrical but huge even from distance. left contrail from both sides. constantly changed direc/speed.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02242013-0003","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/23/2013 04:00 UTC","City":"Oklahoma City","Case Number":"45854","Date Submitted":"02/24/2013 08:41 UTC"}
