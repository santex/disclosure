The object was not as big as the planet to the SW at approximately 50 degrees above the horizon. The object was at high altitude and traveled slower than most commercial jets at high altitude. We do have the Kansas City International Airport within 1 mile but this was not a plane on route to MCI. There were no visible beacons flashing as well as no red or green wing lights. The object continued in a NE heading until out of sight at a slow rate of speed. It was impossible for me determine size or altitude. I do know that this was not like any plane we see flying commercial routes. Planes at high altitude flying at night still have visible beacons and wingtip lights visible. There was no sound with this object and no change in trajectory."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35813.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35813.html"],"Log Number":"US-02142012-0022"}
