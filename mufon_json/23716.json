WE ALWAYS SEE PLANES AT VERY HIGH ALTITUDES LEAVING TRAILS AS THE FLY PAST. THIS EVENING, WHILE SITTING IN THE BACK YARD, A PLANE CAUGHT MY EYE BECAUSE THE SKY WAS SO CLEAR. I NOTICED THA IT WAS LEAVING A VERY SHORT TAIL BEHIND IT, WHERE AS THEY USUALLY LINGER FOR HOURS IN THE SKY. I SPOTTED AN OBJECT THAT WAS FOLLOWING IT AND NOT LEAVING ANY TRAIL LIKE PLANES DO AT THAT HIGH OF AN ALTITUDE. IT WAS KEEPING PACE AND WOULD MOVE ABOVE, BELOW AND TO THE SIDE OF THE PLANE BUT KEEPING A GOOD DISTANCE BEHIND. IT MOVED ABOVE THE PLANES TRAIL AND THEN MADE A SUDDEN AND STEEP ARC LIKE CLIMB AND VANISHED INTO THIN AIR. GONE!! THERE WAS NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY. THE OBJECT WAS NOT REFLECTING LIGHT LIKE THE PLANE WAS. IT SEEMED TO BE VERY OPAQUE AND VERY TEAR DROPPED IN SHAPE. SEEMD MUCH SHORTER THAN THE PLANE BUT MUCH LARGER IN DIAMETER. IT STRUCK ME AS VERY STRANGE BECAUSE THE OBJECT SEEMD TO BE FOLLOWING THE PLANE AS IF TRACKING IT."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Log Number":"US-06122010-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23716.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23716.html"],"City":"Virginia Beach","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Virginia Beach","There were no other sightings in Virginia Beach on or around June 12th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"23716","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
