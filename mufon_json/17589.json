{"Longitude":"16.164904","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn the 19th of June, between 21:30 and 22:30, I was watching the night sky and I saw at least 3 moving objects. Because I'm a bit engaged in astronomy, I completely canceled out the possibility of satellites, as I know that they travel in straight lines with constant speeds. During my observation, some of them crossed the sky. There are often a lot of airplanes in the sky above the St. Jurij in the Gori���ko region, because there are quite some airplane corridors here. But, it was obvious that these lights weren't airplanes, because they weren't making any sounds and they didn't have any positional lights. At first, I saw two changing lights, who were more or less moving in one direction with sharp left and right turns, then they completely stopped, then accelerated etc. They were also changing colors (yellow, green, orange, red etc.). I was watching this event in the completely clear night sky for about 20 minutes, and their movements continued. Then, I noticed another strange object, which was moving between the Big bear and Dragon constellations. It was much brighter and larger than the other two. When this object was moving across the empty and dark section of the night sky, it brightened everything around it. A couple of times, it made turns in the shape of number 8. Once, it went from being normally lit up, like a star, to incredibly bright, like a meteor when it gets into the atmosphere, but then, it instantly became normally lit up again and continued its path across the night sky. I stopped observing this event after almost an hour, but it probably continued for a long time. Because I didn't carry a mobile phone or a camera with me, I couldn't take a picture or shoot a video. This wasn't my first UFO sighting, but it was the first one which I'll post on the internet."],"Summary":"2 small objects like fireballs and 1 bigger and brighter object crossed the night sky.","Case Number":"17589","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17589.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17589.html"],"City":"Murska Sobota","Latitude":"46.66124","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Log Number":"SI-06212009-0011","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Murska Sobota","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"06/19/2009 09:25 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.66124,+16.164904(17589)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17589) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/19/2009 09:25 UTC","Country":"Slovenia"}
