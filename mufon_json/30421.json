This `copter was different, all black with no markings even the glass was blacked out. It circled my neighbourhood for about a minute until it disappeared to the south. Still looking upward, I noticed 2 metalic orbs about 500 ft. above me and they were dancing! Bobbing up and down and circling one another. This went on for about 90 seconds until out of nowhere the `copter returned at full speed headed right towards the orbs. They ( the orbs ) stopped dancing, came together and took off to the west at a very high rate of speed, helicopter in full pursuit! I thought : good luck trying to catch them ! Something very strange is going on."],"Object Features":"None","Country":"Canada","Longitude":"-80.303972","Case Number":"30421","City":"Brantford","Region":"Ontario","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Date of the Event":"04/09/2011 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
