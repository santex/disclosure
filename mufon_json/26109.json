I was staring off into the sky when I saw a bright light in the sky to my left. It fell slighty and seperated into 3 smaller bright lights. The lights formed a triangle and then instantly vanished. I thought I was crazy and got a little scared so I looked over there again and the same thign happened again. I tried to logically explain thsi to myself as I am not a believer in this stuff. It was too high in the sky to be a plane and it was too bright and uniform to be a meteor. It looked like a firework but it was in the outer atmosphere. I can't wxplain what I saw and I was hoping someone else could logically justify this to me. Please. !!!"]}
