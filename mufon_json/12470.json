I was getting ready to sell 15 ponies so I went to all our corrals with a disposible camera. I was in a hurry and just went snapping pictures. I had to pick up my wife in Helena Mt. So it was about 3 or 4 in the afternoon, I quickly used up the roll and went to Wal-mart in helena Mt. Ask them to just put it on a disc it was done before we left town. We got home and were going to email the photos to the proscepctive buyers. When I noticed the ufo in one of the shots at first I though something on the lens but it was fresh out of the tin foil pack and the ufo appeared in none of the other shots. This not the only sitghting we have experienced out on our ranch but the only one with proof. The object is in the upper let hand quadrant."]}
