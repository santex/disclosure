I was looking up at the stars, which I usually do every night. Then Out of nowhere I noticed what looked like a star moving at a really high altitude, moving really fast with a dim trail behind it, then it abrubtly changed direction, and then it just was gone like the lights were turned off. I was amazed I spend countless nights looking at the sky and the stars. It was the first time I have ever seen anything like it. I knew that it wasn't normal the second I saw it change direction the way it did and the speed it seemed to be moving at compared to the extremely high altitude was incredible."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.169359,+-85.493302(50740)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50740) map </A>","Region":"Tennessee","Latitude":"36.169359","Date Submitted":"09/11/2013 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09112013-0001","City":"Cookeville","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Cookeville","There were no other sightings in Cookeville on or around February 21st 2012"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-85.493302"}
