On October 21st I went outside to look at the full moon to the west and noticed the color changing orb seemed very bright and much closer then before so I enlarged the picture and CLEARLY could see it moving and changing colors!! I turned towards the east to look at the full moon and spotted another one above the treeline under the moon but as I surveyed the sky there were MORE!! I don`t have a movie feature on my camera but I took bursts that clearly shows the object moving, changing color AND blue orb looking things seem to always be near although not seen with the naked eye. This has been happening up until last night . If I only had a better camera!!! mine is a panasonic Lumix micro . I have more information if interested.I have believed in UFO`s since I was a little kid, I would LOVE to know more of what`s REALLY happening :)I have MANY more pictures and a better one showing the colore changing orb seemingly either giving or taking energy from a blue one."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/18/2013 06:27 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
