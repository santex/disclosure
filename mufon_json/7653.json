We had no idea what the lights were as the movement was like nothing we could explain. We couldn't believe what we had watched as both of us dont know of any machine that can move around like that. To say we were a little freaked out would be an understatement."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"GB-08122007-0009","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"2 orbs, changing direction backwards, forwards, left & right then right into the distance & disappeared","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"7653","Latitude":"52.144419","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.144419,+-0.459261(7653)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7653) map </A>","Region":"England","City":"Bedford","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
