Amazing part: although itself well-illuminated, the disk cast no light on the ground below.","Date Submitted":"01/24/2010 01:51 UTC","divs":["sighting detailswhile returning from work one evening in early 1979, driving alone toward west chester on marshallton-thorndale road, a road familiar to me, i suddenly came upon a huge, illuminated, silent disk hovering above a field to my left, maybe 40-50' above field and the scrub trees that bordered the field. i had driven that road regularly over the previous six months and knew that nothing was being built in that empty horse pasture. the section of road where it appeared was, at that time, just a dark, narrow, paved, 2-lane country road with no berm, and with no streetlights nor houses anywhere nearby. there was no oncoming traffic. it was in the dead of winter, at a time when it was already almost dark when i left work in coatesville at 5pm. it was my habit to listen to the car radio while driving home, so the radio was probably turned on to the philadelphia 24-hour news station. but when i saw the huge round\\oval \"thing\" hovering above the field, i was auditorily aware only of silence. i can only assume that at some point the radio went dead, but i had no awareness of the radio sound disappearing at the time, probably because my attention was riveted on that strange, bright disk in the air. all i was aware of was that that that \"thing\" seemed very close to my car, too close for comfort, and that for as huge as it was, hanging motionless in the air there, it was absolutely silent. i am very bad at estimating sizes and distances without having something nearby with which to make comparison, but i would say that the disk was very large, but smaller than a football field. i could only see the bottom, and had no sense of whether the sides were boxed or came down to a > on the edge. the bottom of the disk was so evenly illuminated that you could not see bright spots where bulbs would have been. it was just a huge solid, glowing white disk. i couldn't be sure if it was round or slightly oval, because i was looking up at it from off to the side. the strangest part of all to me was that, although the bottom of the disk (the only part i could see) was completely lit in a pure white light of comfortable brightness, it cast no illumination upon the trees or ground beneath it! i don't recall whether i accellerated or decellerated to the t-intersection about a 1\\2 mile ahead where i had to make a left-hand turn, but i think i held my breath as i got there and made the turn onto strasburg road heading toward the town of west chester. i remember somehow feeling \"safe\" that i made it to strasburg, which was a much more heavily travelled street than marshallton-thorndale road. i do recall driving very slowly after i made the turn, crawling along so i could look at that field to my left from the vantage point of the other road. but what i saw was -- absolutely nothing! the field and the air above it were completely empty. in a matter of a minute or less than a minute, the \"thing\" had disappeared, evaporated, gone. i continued my journey home, each mile of the way feeling more and more relieved to have \"escaped\" unharmed. at that time ufos were not a big item in my life. i had heard about them but wasn't sure if they were real or just figments of overactive imaginations. i had never read much about the topic and was, quite frankly, not interested in them. i had never imagined previously that i would ever have any type of encounter with a ufo, because i never thought about them at all. however, immediately when i saw the disk, i thought it was a ufo from another planet. it was the silence of it that seemed so unearthly. my overall feelings during the encounter were ones of excitement tinged with fear. afterwards other emotions emerged, mostly embarrassment. there was also a little bit of pride that i had been somehow chosen to see this revelation. however, i told no one, not a single soul, about this experience for several years. the main reason for my silence was that my work was in the mental health field, and i did not want to be seen or teased as \"crazy\" for talking about such an experience. and, in addition, there was no one in my life at that time whom i felt deserved to learn about this special encounter. this event happened such a long time ago -- 31 years ago. i've written here every possible aspect of the encounter and all my feelings about it. it was a momentary event in my life, probably less than two minutes out of what is now going on 70 years. but it did make a strong impression upon me. the reason i looked up your website to tell you about this tonight is that this evening i just listened for the first time to a member of mufon on the renseradio.com. i don't mind being contacted by a mufon, but i really don't want to talk to others about this."],"Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"01/10/1979 05:30 UTC","Case Number":"21609","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in West Chester","There were no other sightings in West Chester on or around January 10th 1979"]}
