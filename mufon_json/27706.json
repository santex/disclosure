Then I thought it must be a plane. So I was just watching. It had 1 bright light and 3 smaller lights around the bright one. Not really looking like a plane. It seemed to just stop moving, then it went around in a circle. Stopped again then started moving in my direction. Then stopped again. That's when I can see the light formation perfectly."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Klamath Falls","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.699267","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"02/06/2011 08:05 UTC","Longitude":"-121.605513","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
