It also shined a bright white light occasionally. My wife, kids and I observed it for several minutes... the object started to move away north towards the mountains. I decided to get in my vehicle to see if I can get a closer look. I traveled north on Milliken ave towards the mountains keeping the object in site. As I reached the top of Milliken the object was directly over the mountain and was shining some type of search light on to the mountain. I could actually see the mountain side light up. The craft's light at this point was white... I could make out three point of lights and the beam of light pointing down on the mountain. It remained in the same spot for approximately 5 minutes. The search light turned off after a couple minutes and the object almost seemed as if it had parked. I then noticed another red light emerge to my right just a couple hundred feet to the east of the initial object. The red light traveled to east slowly and then south. I once again got in my vehicle to get a closer look. I traveled south on Milliken towards Foothill but could not get a close enough. I proceeded to head back north on Milliken to see if the other object was still there... I could see it from a distance. This time it was a solid greenish blue type color. As I am getting closer towards the top of Milliken it starts to travel east. As I reached the top of Milliken I was parallel with the object. It couldn���t have been more than a couple hundred feet away and the object was flying really low to the ground. It did not make any noise. The greenish blue object was surrounded by blinking strobe lights. I would say at least 8-12 different strobes. The object traveled east then seemed to remain stationary for about 10 minutes. I observed it along with 3 other similar lights for a good 10 minutes off to the east. It was not moving. I tried to get a closer look and proceeded east toward the city of Fontana. Every time I would seem to get closer it would start to move away. I traveled all the way to Sierra ave in Fontana. The lights got further away so I decided to head back home. At my closest proximity to the object on the top of Milliken I would estimate the object to be no bigger than a Goodyear blimp. It was difficult to make out due to all the strobe lights around the greenish blue light. As my family and I observed this object my sister in law and her husband viewed the object as well and traveled to the top of Hellman drive and also observed the beam of light it omitted onto the mountain."],"Case Number":"15032","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15032.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15032.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Rancho Cucamonga","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval"}
