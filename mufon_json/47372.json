I was heading for the 55 north freeway. I saw a black triangle. The black triangle was descending, in a straight path,at the same speed than a normal plane would. From where I was sitting in my car, it was descending to my left. The whole event lasted only about 4-5 seconds, and then it disappeared,because the building triangle square, was blocking it from my view."],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Newport Beach","There were no other sightings in Newport Beach on or around May 12th 2013"],"Longitude":"-117.880247","Summary":"black triangle, descending, going towards the ocean-side.","Log Number":"US-05122013-0020"}
