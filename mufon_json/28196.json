On one of the cubes it I found what it looks like a flying saucer,you can see an intake port on top of it ,it also looks like some of the cubes have big windows,lots of blue ionized lighting. on some other cubes looks like pipes with elbows,not natural. It is my belief that most of the U.F.O.s sighted come from these cubes. I can give you the RA & Dec on them, if you want to look into this."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28196.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28196_submitter_file1__5.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28196_submitter_file2__Cube5womanbelowarchway.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28196_submitter_file3__32.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28196.html"],"Date Submitted":"03/11/2011 08:53 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Latitude":"43.129137","Tags":"City","City":"Silver Lake","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.129137,+-121.038709(28196)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28196) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular"}
