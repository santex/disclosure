At first it looked like a quasar but then I noticed it was moving across the mountain tops in a slow deliberate line. There was no sound as it moved but it moved so slow that it could not be an aircraft such as a plane or helicopter. The light from the object changed color from red to orange to yellow in quick succession. I watched as the object disappeared behind the mountains but noticed that the light from it gave off a bright aura that never changed its brightness. As it slowly came back from behind the mountains it continued on its slow deliberate path until it went behind a larger group of mountains and I could not see it again. I honestly have never seen anything that bright or slow moving in the sky. It was a moonless night and the skies were clear. I am a former soldier who's MOS dealt directly with aircraft identification so I know the difference between small prop planes, jets and helicopters. I do not know if there were any local radar tracks that could confirm what I saw."],"City":"Orovada","Tags":"City","Region":"Nevada","Log Number":"US-11172013-0002","Longitude":"-117.790605","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Orovada","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"41.558562","Date Submitted":"11/17/2013 04:45 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Quasar looking light","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00"}
