I also realized it was Sunday the 6th rather then the 13th that the event took place. On Sunday the 6th of July around 6pm I was driving from a restaurant in Westland towards my home in Livonia (Michigan). I turned off of Wayne Rd onto Ann Arbor Trail (heading towards Farmington Rd) when off to my left I noticed what at first I thought might be a plane. I quickly realized that I couldn���t see any wings or a tail so I started viewing it more intently. It was close enough that I should have been able to notice if it had wings or a tail but because it was very similar in size to a 747 I assumed maybe it was just an optical illusion because of the angle I was viewing it at or whatnot. I then noticed that it was going strangely slow for a plane though. By this time I went behind some trees and I assumed it would be gone by the time I came to the clearing near the trafic light at Ann Arbor Trail and Hines drive but to my surprise it was still in the sky close to the same area I saw it in before my view was blocked by the trees. I thought for a second that it might have been a blimp due its slow speed but it seemed too thin to be a blimp. I still couldn���t make out any wings or a tail at this point when I had an even better view of it. When it speed up fairly rapidly and disappeared from view I knew it defintly wasn't a blimp however. When I made it home I told my mom about this and to my surprise she said she just heard someone on the radio mention a cigar shaped craft. I still didn���t make a report at this point because it was only one other person who said they had seen something and I thought maybe I was just being fooled by a strange optical trick or angle of flight and maybe it was a plane. It was definitely out of the ordinary enough to make the hairs stand up on my arm and I really wanted to pull over to get a better look but with the traffic and everything I didn���t do it. Later however there was a whole rash of sightings of cigar shaped aircraft here in Michigan in the past few weeks so it made me think I should make a report. On a Detroit TV news channel (forgot which channel) a few days ago (two I believe) I head them speaking about sightings of a cigar shaped craft at night that had red and orange lights and moved in a puzzling manner. It was viewed by a large number of people and the police were called to the scene. According to news the police stated that there were no helicopters in the area ( I guess because of it's movement some people thought it could be helicopter). The day after that I was listening to the Drew and Mike program and they had people calling in discussing the UFO sightings and one person stated that he and all the people at a local children���s baseball game also noticed a cigar shaped craft with red and orange lights at an earlier date as well. None of these sightings were in Livonia or Westland though but they were close by. I will take some pictures of the area I witnessed the (whatever it was I saw) at. Maybe someone else has seen this as well?"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Metalic Cigar Shapped object","Log Number":"US-07232008-0013","Date of the Event":"07/06/2008 06:00 UTC"}
