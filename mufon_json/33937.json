{"divs":["sighting detailslooooonnng story. saw that another gentleman posted a report about a triangle in nj, exactly what i saw, not the same year tho. i was searching thru archives to see if there were any other sightings the same night as mine, 10 year difference but so similar it i knew i have to report mine now as well. jan 11, 1996- i had a second floor apartment in a section of manahawkin called beach haven west. it was maybe 500-800 feet from rt 72, and right before you get on the bridge to lbi. where i was in my apartment i would be overlooking the marshes to the north of rt 72. i had broken my leg badly, literally in half, in october and was in a cast from my toes to my hip. my girlfriend had left for the night, i was laying in bed watching tv. i had a long bedroom, and the window i was facing was to the north. i noticed a flicker of amber light thru that window, thought nothing of it. maybe a helicopter. continued to watch tv, every couple minutes seeing that amber light kinda go up and down slowly, light getting bigger. this went on for awhile, and i started to think maybe they were looking for something in the marsh, but didnt see any spotlights or nothing. its been out there for a good 20 minutes, 1\\2 hr. now im watching the light more than the tv. it barely looks like its moving, gaining and losing a minimum amount of altitude, but enough for me to be watching it. ok, itll get closer, the house will shake, itll be a helicopter..still watching, after a couple minutes it was getting closer and there were no green and red flying lights that i can see. at this point, even if it was a helicopter i had to see whats going on. it took a couple minutes to get out of bed and to the window, it was not easy, i was in alot of pain, and i was having complications i didnt know about till i had to go back to the doctor. i opened the window and propped myself up on the sill. at this point, i knew it wasnt a helicopter, and i knew it wasnt a plane. helicopters are out here all the time, coast guard, mosquito commission, etc. i also grew up 5 minutes from jfk airport. when we were talking on the phone back home, every 4 minutes youd have to tell whoever your talking to to hold on while the planes went overhead because you couldnt hear them. i know what a plane looks like. theres also a big military presence out here, warthogs, bombers, you name it. (to mufon, the phoenix lights are flares. i stupidly stood in a cul de sac pointing up to the sky because of lights appearing in the sky and hovering there, only to have a gentleman walk up to me and show me the plane that was dropping flares, exact same effect.) anyway, light kept getting closer and i can start to see how low it was, and how slow it was going. literally nothing more than 20-30 mph. about now it about 2-3 miles away over the marshes to the north and headed straight for me. it was getting close enough now that i saw it had more lights, the amber was the forward bottom of it, and a red and green to the other corners. much bigger than the lights on an airplane would be and steady, not flashing. now, i had to get outside. on crutches and hurting i hobbled out of the room thru the kitchen and onto my small screen deck. i wanted a clearer view than thru the screens and i had to hobble down a step or 2 outside the deck to get a wide open unobstructed view. this thing was getting closer and on a path to go directly overhead. i can start to make out a shape and it was a triangle, and it looked big. i watched it go over the marsh heading south, and watched as it crossed over rt 72 and eventually right over me. it was a huge black traingle with three lights, one on each corner,and not much of anything else. it passed literally 100-200 feet overhead, enough to know if a had a gun i could have hit it easily. ( dont worry i wouldnt have) it made no sound, silent. it was literally only moving about 30mph, a plane would be crashing into my house and a helicopter would be rearranging my dishes in the cabinets. it took about 30 seconds from when it hit rt 72 to the time it went over my house and i had a clear view the whole time. no i didnt have a camera, at the time the throw away cameras were my thing, but i didnt have one. if i did i would have the best ufo pictures to this date. i remember this event better than when i lost my virginity, got married, etc, will never as long as i live forget this. it was amazing."],"Latitude":"39.700047","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/11/1996 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-12102011-0001","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Triangle, 3 lights, moved so slow, watched for about an hour","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33937.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33937.html"],"Date Submitted":"12/10/2011 12:26 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.700047,+-74.253833(33937)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33937) map </A>","Region":"New Jersey","Country":"United States","Case Number":"33937","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-74.253833","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Stafford","There were no other sightings in Stafford on or around January 11th 1996"],"Tags":"City","City":"Stafford","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
