They had a private beach about a quarter mile long with rocky outcrops on either end. I walked down the hill to the beach and lay in the sand. I was the only person there. It was a cloudless perfect summer's day. I looked up and there it was! I thought, \"what a funny looking airplane. Oh shit it's not moving!\" It was solid silver, not shiny, more like pewter, soft, airbrushed. It was almost directly over-head and had two small shark-fin wings. I thought weather baloon. Cant be it's metal, On closer inspection I could see that there were no insignias, no seams no windows no engines it was small airplane or high helicopter distance away. I started to get up to alert my friends when it took off straight up warp speed. It was one of the highlights of my life! My New Zealand friends were non-plussed because people see them all the time along this coast."],"Log Number":"NZ-10282007-0008","Date Submitted":"02/20/1981 02:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"New Zealand","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-38.656334,+178.019519(8239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8239) map </A>","Latitude":"-38.656334","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Gisborne","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Source":"MUFON"}
