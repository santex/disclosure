They were about ten miles southeast of us. We could see a light that was much bigger than the brightest stars just hanging in the sky. It was drifting slowly to the west-northwest horizon. It was going the opposite direction of just about everything in the sky that night. It was too big to be a satellite and did not have any FAA regulated lights indicating it was a plane. Unlikely to be military as it was too close to the regular landing lanes of authorized aircraft."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/19/2010 12:36 UTC","Summary":"Bright Floating Light in Western Sky","Longitude":"-93.370219"}
