Initially I thought it was a reflection from the stop light. I slow the car down and looked up and to my left and watched as this green ball of light shot across the sky and disappeared over the trees. I turned off the main road hoping to bypass the trees, but it was gone. I expected to hear some sort of explosion but did not. I've seen strange things in the sky, but this had to be one of the most amazing! I came home and immediately accessed the internet to find out if anyone had seen anything like this in the past. I found one image that was similar, though not as large or exactly the same color. Another article describes a similar object and said it was a meteorite. I've seen shooting stars, meteor showers but nothing like the object I witnessed this evening."],"Longitude":"-73.606603","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Baldwin","There were no other sightings in Baldwin on or around August 21st 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"08/21/2009 10:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Baldwin","Summary":"Large green glowing orb.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.671344,+-73.606603(18799)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18799) map </A>"}
