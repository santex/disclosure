(4)i then saw 2 star-like dots flying fast and close to the plane and they flew away to the east... then seconds later i saw a fleet of about 10-12 dots flying in a loose diamond pattern... while flying from north to south east they made no sound and a another plane was flying farther away... this diamond pattern had planes in the middle doing circles and figure 8's without breaking pattern\\speed... they were so small it was hard to see them at times... (6)they would disappear by flying so far away because the visibility was perfect... (3)i thought it was a star at first because i could see the moon at the same time... i think it was a fleet of unmanned drones or a fleet of falcons riding the thermals at very high altitudes and pulling some serious g's\\ maneuvers... if those 2 can be disproved then i don't know what i saw... i hope you can find the radar data over glen morris on between 1-2pm, march 17, 2013 to see if there's any evidence... (5) i was in disbelief thinking i was seeing things so i would blink and shake my head and look away occasionally to make sure it wasn't a hallucination\\ optical illusion.... i watched confused and a little scared because i've never seen anything like it... i'm a military aircraft fanatic and not even thrust vectoring could produce these results in my opinion...i don't often look at my e-mail so maybe facebook would be a better way to contact me."],"City":"Glen Morris"}
