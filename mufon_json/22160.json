It made no sound at all, and when the plane that I observed in the sky started to get close I heard it well. What was interesting with the object it that before it was close to the horizon just started going down from my perspective it just dissapeared, much sooner to dissapear over the horizon. I believe I was seeing the big dipper and the object just dissapered from below the right of the big dipper. I should really get a camera."]}
