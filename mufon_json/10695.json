{"Latitude":"42.537289","Region":"Massachusetts","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was about 10pm on a Saturday night in April 08, my wife and I were driving down rt495 heading south in the Littleton MA area. We had just passed the Lowell Connector and I spotted two bright lights about 5 miles ahead. Initially I thought they were landing lights of an aircraft. But, as we drove closer the lights just hung there. Everyone was driving about 70mph and as we all got closer to the lights everone slowed down to about 45 - 50 mph. The lights were on my side, I had my wife steer while I stuck my head out the window to see. The lights just hung there at about 1000ft. We didn't see any blinking nav lights (red and green)of a typical aircraft. I didn't hear any sound while sticking my head out the window, the best thing would of been to pull off the highway to listen for a sound."],"Longitude":"-71.512802","Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Littleton","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"10695","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Littleton","There were no other sightings in Littleton on or around April 11th 2008"],"Summary":"Strange white lights over head","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/11/2008 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.537289,+-71.512802(10695)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10695) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-05082008-0005","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"04/11/2008 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10695.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10695.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10695.html"]}
