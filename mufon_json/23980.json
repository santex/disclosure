It wobbled from left to right as it slowly headed south before changing it's direction to the west. As it moved toward the west, the orange light expanded and then dimmed and I could no longer see the object. Some apartments would soon block my view of it anyway so I walked upstairs to my apartment balcony, hoping to possibly see the object again since I would now have a view of where it was going. I then saw the object still moving west but at a faster speed. At this point it still had no lights on and it looked like a gray or white craft shaped like an oval. I lost sight of it over my neighboring apartments. It was exhilarating, I only wish I had footage to share."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Orange UFO turns it's lights off over the city.","City":"Seattle","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.324581","Region":"Washington"}
