{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approximately 8:10 pm while returning from Connersville, IN to Liberty, IN, my husband yelled at me to look behind me. I did so and we both saw a large obol at the 5 oclock position with a beam of a softer orange whitish glow reaching to a smaller obol. The larger appeared to be \"taking in\" the smaller obol through the beam and there was a very small dot in the beam. After they merged, the larger obol flashed brightly, then faded out. The weather was rainy where we were, and we are really not sure where this object was, only that it was off behind a mailbox on Dunlapsville Rd. We would have taken Rte. 44, however, I told my husband to take the other rd., because he had hit a cat on the way to Connersville and frankly, I didn't want to see it. Whatever this was, it made no sound as we stopped to try to get a picture. There was NO sound, not even crickets, which we heard when we got home."],"Case Number":"43341","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Unknown","Log Number":"US-10172012-0027","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.606645,+-85.037377(43341)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43341) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/17/2012 09:48 UTC","Summary":"Large Obol with faded staight line at 7 oclock position to a second obol","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other, Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/17/2012 08:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.606645","City":"connersville","Longitude":"-85.037377","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43341.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43341.html"],"trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in connersville","There were no other sightings in connersville on or around October 17th 2012"],"Region":"Indiana"}
