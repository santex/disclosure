{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside with a few friends. I happened to look up and saw a high altitiude plane. The plane was leaving natural contrails. Above it we saw a very bright, almost reflective light in the sky. The skies were clear and blue. At first we thought it was a star. Then the object moved. It was to the Northeast of us. The object began to move west very slow. It then went North at a quicker pace and went over the local mountains. As we were standing there talking about it, I looked up only to see it coming back from over the mountains. Now heading South. It had appeared to drop in altitude some. It procedded very slowly over us, almost hovering at times. It was a very large mass reflecting the sun. We could see reflections from two sides. Not knowing what it was we called the News. As i decided to go for my camera, it was last observed quickly climbing and went out of site. **Note- Exact date is 3-19-2012..
