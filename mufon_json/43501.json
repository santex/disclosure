From what I could make out was that they were metallic and round considering they were so high up it almost looked like a small dots, I could see them fairly well. They were moving at a very fast speed and I could only observe them for about 20 to 30 sec. then they blended in with the blue sky. It was very strange indeed"],"Date Submitted":"10/24/2012 12:56 UTC","Region":"Louisiana","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-10242012-0011","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43501.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43501.html"],"Date of the Event":"10/24/2012 11:17 UTC"}
