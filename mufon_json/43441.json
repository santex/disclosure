Having observed a few minutes I noticed a very fast moving object almost directly above heading in a relatively southward direction. I originally assumed this to be a meteor but there was no trail and the object was bright white and small, about the size and intensity of the brightest visible star within the city. The object transversed approximately 4 inches relative distance in the sky in appx. 3 seconds before making an abrupt easterly turn at which point I almost totally assumed it to not be a meteor or satellite. After the turn I lost total contact with the object within 1-2 seconds. I continued to observe for a few minutes and saw nothing more. Had I not been looking for meteors at that time the object would have completely escaped my attention."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.971039,+-87.576783(43441)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43441) map </A>","Date of the Event":"10/21/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-87.576783","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43441.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43441.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like"}
