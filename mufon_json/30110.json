We both spotted one headed to our left (not sure the direction) and seconds later spotted 2 more flying the opposite direction towards the first object, crossing each others paths. Slowly they spread apart (weird to me seeing they were flying right beside each other for about 15 seconds). I have never seen satellites pass each other so close before let alone 3 at a time."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30110.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30110.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
