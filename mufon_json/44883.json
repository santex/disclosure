After I noticed the same light in the corner of my eye three times I got up to see what it was. It was not firework. It was approx. five glowing orange cicles. About the same color as street lights, a bit darker. I noticed the lights where moving N.E. out of my view from my front window so I went to my kitchen in the back of my house. I aquired the lights still moving N.E while forming a triangle and circling around each other but still moving. I started to lose sight of the lights so I went upstair to see if I could still see. I saw one light upstairs as it disappeared out of view. Thats what I saw at 11:57 pm New Years Eve. Also wanted you to know this is my first sighting of an object moving in the sky."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Manitoba","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"44883","Log Number":"CA-01012013-0010","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Winnipeg","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.901854,+-97.131844(44883)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44883) map </A>"}
