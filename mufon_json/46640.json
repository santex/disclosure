I looked out the window and southwest of me there was this triangle shaped black thing floating above the down town area. Now, I did not have my glasses on but it was definitely triangle shaped and appeared to be quite close, I was going to dismiss it as a helicopter, as it was hovering, but there was no sound at all. So I thought maybe the wind direction is somehow not allowing any sound. But then this object started moving, slowly at first, then zooming out of town at great speed and disappearing from my sight to the mountains in the northwest. I am still not quite sure what it was. I lost sight of it because of buildings that were around me."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/06/2013 05:25 UTC","Longitude":"-18.10313","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Country":"Iceland"}
