We were talking under the clear night sky, I looked up and observed the 2 objects... One high in the sky, the other appeared much lower and tracking. Then a burst as what appeared to be a missile came from one speeding towards the higher flying object. It flew off at high speed and the missile disappeared. The lower flying military jet (as I saw it) just followed. Now let me say this, I've looked to the sky before as an amateur student astronomer. I've seen the shuttle, and the international space station, and nothing ever compared to this event. What is really funny about it is that when it happened, I didn't even mention to my cousin to look up....I kept it to myself for over 10 years. The date is only an approximation....I should have recorded the date...but I bet I wasn't alone that night to see this....and this by the way convinced me of the existance of UFO's because the military fired at it."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/02/2001 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.410889,+-121.362398(35662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35662) map </A>","Log Number":"US-02132012-0001","Date Submitted":"02/13/2012 12:22 UTC","Summary":"military jet fired missiles at very fast very high flying object I just happened to look up to see it happen.","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-121.362398"}
