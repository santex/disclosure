The orb appeared to be very far away in the sky; it had fuzzy edges, almost fluorescent orange and very unlike any other color in the sky. It was probably 10 times brighter than any star. It moved to the west. A few seconds later a second orb, just like the first, appeared in the same spot where the first orb appeared. Then a third and a fourth. The orbs moved single file to the west. In the space between the Little Dipper and Big Dipper, the orbs appeared to stop moving. Then the first orb faded away in a matter of seconds. The remaining three orbs then pivoted 90 degrees about the second orb. The fourth orb faded, then the third orb faded, and finally the second orb faded away. These orbs had a similar appearance to the four orbs that I reported on #49944. Another adult and a child also saw these orbs. The child mentioned that the color of the 'things' was very unique."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Four fuzzy reddish-orange orbs traveled single file","Date of the Event":"08/17/2013 09:25 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50149.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50149.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"50149","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.395646,+-83.909412(50149)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50149) map </A>"}
