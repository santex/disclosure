{"divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was unusually warm outside, so I decided to take a nice cycle across campus looking for squirrels and other wild-life. After going from one end back to the other, methinks I saw a shadow pass over me obstructing the moon light. I looked up and saw a large blimp-egg, teardrop aircraft above me. In the distance I thought I heard the banging of native drums. I thought it was an aircraft from the nearby airforce base, but it wasn't shaped like a regular plane. It was ovular and massive. After seeing the object, I stopped riding. Off in the distance over the soccer fields, I noticed that it stopped moving. Then a light shone down onto the snowy field, and vaporized all the snow. I contacted the airforce base in Chickopee to ask if there was a large object in the area. They responded by saying there was not."],"Case Number":"9128","Log Number":"US-01212008-0026","Object Shape":"Blimp, Chevron, Egg, Flash, Oval, Teardrop","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Massachusetts","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"01/13/2008 02:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9128.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9128.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"I was bicycling across campus, when I noticed the UFO-like object floating over the local sports field.","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Amherst","There were no other sightings in Amherst on or around January 13th 2008"],"Disposition":"Hoax","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/13/2008 02:30 UTC","Longitude":"-72.509947","Tags":"City","City":"Amherst","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.374417,+-72.509947(9128)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9128) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.374417"}
