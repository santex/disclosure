We both saw around object with red, blue, white, etc. lights going around object. It then lifted up and zoomed west without a sound. I didn't stop to investigate but know what I saw was not public technology. I have told friends up to this point but figured it is time to record the incident. Not first time seeing other worldly crafts either. Ben"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
