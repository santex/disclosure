After 3-4 seconds, the lights shot off to the East very quickly. There was no sounds heard during the sighting. Witness called her friend because she thought the craft was hovering over the friend's neighborhood. The friend said that she was in bed at the time, however, one of her normally docile cats woke her up in a frenzy, and that cat appeared to want the woman to get out of bed. The witness indicates that the owner of the cat will likely consent to interview if deemed necessary. The witness also says that she is an artist and will be glad to provide a sketch of what she saw.
