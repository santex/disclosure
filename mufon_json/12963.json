{"Country":"United States","Summary":"UFO's following contrails and aircraft making contrails; 2 events, same location","divs":["sighting detailsi have observed two separate ufo events during the day. the first ufo occurred while i was traveling on i-25 heading north through denver\\lakewood, co. i have frequently noticed the interesting contrails being made by aircraft that are significantly different from the normal aircraft contrails. the contrails tend to stick around for up to 10 min and can be turned on\\off in the cockpit of the aircraft. the second contrail was being made (see picture) and as the aircraft was finishing its run a bright sphere appeared. it was at the same altitude as the aircraft contrail (~ fl 36, heading slightly north of west), and stayed in a position between the two contrails. it went to bright white to a lesser bright white for 20 sec. then appeared 5 degrees south of its original position and performed the same sequence of events. after observing the ufo for 2 min it disappeared. interestingly enough a very similar event occurred again into the same area at 1109 on 8 oct 2008. the contrails were being made again in the same area of the sky. i observed the ufo appear between the two contrails again. however the object was significantly bigger and cigar shaped. it appeared at 1109 and followed the contrailing aircraft for 3 min until 1112. it first stayed in about the same position then proceeded to follow the aircraft in a south westerly direction. it disappeared suddenly after this event. this has been interesting as the ufo���s have been around the same alt (~fl360) and always seemed to be in the same spot. the later observation ufo seemed to be ~twice the length of the aircraft, while the first ufo was ��� the length of the aircraft. i have many hours of flight experience and i know when it is not a normal aircraft, balloon, or biologic species. thanks for letting me share!"],"City":"Lakewood","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-105.114048","trends":["There have been 39 other sightings in Lakewood","There were no other sightings in Lakewood on or around October 7th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.710942,+-105.114048(12963)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12963) map </A>","Case Number":"12963","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10082008-0017","Latitude":"39.710942","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/07/2008 04:09 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12963.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12963_submitter_file1__UFOobservationOct7andOct8.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12963.html"],"Region":"Colorado","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"10/07/2008 04:09 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Cigar, Sphere"}
