All of a sudden a very bright white light appeared and then took off. I believe this might be a vortex or something because I see them almost everyday. I see them in the night and the day. Usually in the north sky. Sometimes there will be just pin points of light real fast and other times there will be streaks of light. The first time I saw it I came in the house and told my husband I had just seen a ufo. I was excited now I can't help but to look everyday and night and I usually see something within 10 minutes of looking. I don't have a digital camera. If I did I would try to take some photographs. Anyone in my area could probably see them too if they look. I must warn you they are extremely fast in and out in less time than you can blink."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14613.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14613.html"],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.082235,+-79.789175(14613)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14613) map </A>","trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Greensboro","There were no other sightings in Greensboro on or around May 31st 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/31/2008 10:28 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
