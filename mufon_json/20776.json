It was clearly visible against a clear blue sky moving about 150 M.P.H. No observable Propulsion system, no cockpit, no vapor trail, no sound, moving steadily. at the end of the event the center of the object started to disappear and blend with the blue sky. the edges turned a medium gray color and slowly they too faded away and the object completely disappeared. I looked for a good 25 or 30 seconds for any sign but the object was completely gone. It was the most amazing thing I have seen in my whole life. Call me if you have any questions, any day around Noon or if im not there leave a message on my message machine."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20776.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20776.html"],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Log Number":"US-11282009-0011","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"20776","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-95.017393","Latitude":"29.670324","City":"La Porte","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in La Porte","There was one other sighting in La Porte on or around November 12th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.670324,+-95.017393(20776)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20776) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
