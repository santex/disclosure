{"Country":"United States","Case Number":"32125","Log Number":"US-09272011-0002","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.996083","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"non-flashing, light emmiting, star-like object hovered a long time forming triangles in the sky","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy friend and I camping in the Adirondacks and did not have watches or our cell phones on because they are useless up there. We were sitting by the campfire just watching the sky on Sunday night. We observed an object, very high in the sky, with an irregular flashing, unlike a passenger plane that has constant, regular flashing. This object appeared from the north, was moved in a mostly circular pattern heading south, west, north, east then south again. Speed did not appear unusual, only the flashing and flight pattern. Because Ft. Drum is relatively close we were speculating this was merely a military aircraft. Immediately after the craft made an apparent circle, slightly to the east of it, my friend noticed another craft so high it was just a pinprick of light (or a very high flying plane). We lost sight of the first craft almost immediately after seeing the second one but between the two of us both we sighted at the same time for a moment. This one had a constant, non-flashing light and was flying south. As we watched this second craft it appeared to stop for apx. 2 ��� 3 seconds then continue its course. It turned slightly east, stopped again, started again and would appear to accelerate slightly for a second or two then go back to its ���normal��� flight speed which could be compared to a very high plane. This pattern happened a couple times and then it just stopped. We continued watching for apx 20-30 minutes but it did not move. I was tired and went to sleep; my friend tired of watching it too but when he did look back about an hour later it was gone. This second craft stopped at a point in the sky which created 2 triangle shaped constellations. In the first the craft was the left point, nearly parallel with the right point (a star), the third point (a star) at the bottom. In the second triangle the craft created the top point of a triangle. It was positioned to the right and higher then Ursa Major, left of and lower then of Camelopardalls, My friend had a night vision scope (sorry I do not know the model but can get it). The magnification isn���t great but it did slightly magnify the craft and it was not an exact circle. At first there appeared to be a tail, like a tear drop but less pronounced, to the west of it. A few minutes later it appeared more as a kidney shape but most of that shape was caused by the light that appeared to be emitted. The object was a slightly different color then the stars around it but being a night vision scope everything appears green tinted so exact color was hard to observe. At one point it did appear slightly orange to the naked eye. Again, there was a glow around it like it was emitting light differently than the nearby stars. A few weeks ago my daughter and I were watching the sky and it looked like a star just disappeared in the same area of sky, very possibly the exact location because I recall seeing the triangle. We see so much strangeness that I didn���t pay much attention to it."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around September 25th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"09/27/2011 03:21 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32125.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32125.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/25/2011 10:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.719293,+-73.996083(32125)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32125) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Teardrop, Other","Region":"New York","City":"New York","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"40.719293"}
