We stopped on the side of the road and looked over the ocean. We saw a little light just dancing about over the sea. It was hard to gauge it's distance, but my unscientific guess would be 10 miles out. The light just bounced around. It moved around a lot, but didn't go anywhere. Up, down, left right, etc. We watched it for about five minutes and we left before the light was extinguished. I'm not sure what made us first notice the object. I think we stopped to pee or something. And we were looking over the dark ocean and noticed it. My feelings: I was a little unsure of what it was. Living in California, I tend to see Army stuff often: rockets, jet fighters, etc. I didn't think it was that though. I didn't think it was a plane. I was completely dumbfounded and was content with not ever knowing. I didn't lose sight of it, I just left."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Santa Cruz","There were no other sightings in Santa Cruz on or around January 11th 2006"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/11/2006 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/17/2010 12:45 UTC"}
