I noticedthe movement as I would an airplane overhead. I knew it was not a plane as ithalted movement. Immediately, I called for my family to come out and see. Mysister, brother, and a neighbor came out. After they all came out, I ran insideto find a camera (7E30sec), the camera was not in the location I thought it was, so I ran backoutside. The object then began to move away at a 45-degree angle. The objectjust shrunk in size, then it was gone. We then called the Schenectady Countyairport, however, we were directed to call back during business hours. I didfind a reference to the object in the Grolier Encyclopedia Science Supplement1969, page 56. This object we saw is identical to the one Paul Trentphotographed in Oregon on May 11, 1950. Our sighting took place in Schenectady,NY on August of 1970. I felt compelled to write this, even though it took placeover 30 years ago. I hope it will help your database efforts."]}
