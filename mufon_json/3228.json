My recept is time stamped 2:45:28 am . The cashier and I spoke for a few minutes about gemstones , here son had given her a nice ring with an oval cabuchon of Cherry Amber , I'm a collector . I started walking home via Chapel Street . I had gotten to the top of the rise , near the intersection of North State Street , when something caught my attention . I suddenly noticed that a star was not a star . It hovered silently and was too low on the horizon , at about the height of a regular jetliner . It strobed red and green , then blue , red and green , then blue repeatedly , it seemed to be a repetitive pattern . It hovered . Jetliners do not have blue strobes and do not hover and do generate quite a bit of noise . Then it headed South , I was not aware of any noise . It came to a stop , hovered briefly , performed a very tight \"U-Turn\" and returned to its' original position North by North West over the Northern end of Concord . It seemed much larger than a jetliner as it continued to hover at its' original position . It seemed to be circular in shape with a domed or curved top and bottom . It had no wings , no tail assembly , nothing one would associate with aircraft . I arrived back home at 3:06 am and it was still hovering in its' original position . I tried to call \"The Concord Monitor\" newsroom , there was no one at that hour , however , I did leave a message . I then remembered that I had to take out the trash ; it was still there hovering in its' original position strobing red and green then blue . I still heard no noise , yet I could hear the traffic on the Interstate which is down the hill . Usually one ignores that constant drone of trucks and vehicles , one just automatically tunes them out , that's most probably a trick one learns subconsciously , that traffic noise was noticeable as I was probably listening for noise from that UFO and it generated no noise . I am aware that a number of years ago there were a number of \"sightings\" here in New Hampshire , I was not aware that these were continuing . I really don't know how I feel about this . At the moment I realised that this was an UFO , I did feel a certain sense of excitement , one of those rare \"Eureka !!\" moments . But , quite frankly , reports of this nature are rather commonplace and my \"sighting\" and $ 1.50 will still get me a cup of coffee . I don't mean to sound blassee , but I am still the exact same person I was when I left to pick up some packs of smokes . I will report this to Bass & Gregg's offices tomorrow , not that there is anything they can do about an UFO that has probably returned to its' place of origin . I can't for the life of me imagine why they would be interested on the crazy people on this planet in the first place . Really , given a choice , there must be must nicer vacation spots in the Cosmos !!!!! Yours truly, Brian Napier PS ..... I have no idea what county this is . Concord, is the State Capitol . Manchester is in Hillsborough County and Nashua is in Merrimack County . This might be Merrimack County as well but I doubt it !!"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-71.532162","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New Hampshire","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Dome"}
