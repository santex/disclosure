She noticed the two lights first and called my attention to them. They were coming from the west towards town. Movement was steady but speed and exact course varied slightly for both lights. They were moving together but not synchronously. We went outside for a better view. There was only one light cloud in the sky to the south. The lights stopped eastward movement at a position we would describe as south of town. The northernmost light simply hovered but the southernmost light moved slightly to the southeast. Both lights then proceeded to move south and to elevate their altitude. The only cloud in the sky was on their course to the south. The northernmost light entered the cloud first and was lost to sight. The southernmost light continued for about a minute or two longer before passing through the cloud."],"Date Submitted":"06/13/2010 03:54 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Newberg","There were no other sightings in Newberg on or around June 11th 2010"],"Case Number":"23730","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange lights moving west to east then south.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23730.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23730.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Teardrop","Latitude":"45.300118","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"06/11/2010 10:05 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.300118,+-122.973156(23730)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23730) map </A>","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
