{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Details I was leaning outside my window (smoking) watching leaves flutter in the sky (from an updraft) when I saw an object as bright as venus moving into my line of sight, moving westward. I could not tell the elevation. It was relatively cloudless so there was nothing to scale. I watched it as it flew in an arc like direction and vanished over the treeline to the south (SSE possibly). I heard no sound at all from it. It was quite bright. Whether it was glowing or if it was reflecting the sun, I could not tell. It was only in my sight for about 10 seconds. Approximately 15 seconds later I saw a Piper Cub type plane flying in a westerly direction. The object I saw appeared to be at a higher altitude than the plane. I could hear the prop sound of the plane very clearly. It was moving pretty fast to cover such a span of skyline in a matter of a few seconds. At first I thought it was a plane, but it was too quiet and too fast. I also thought it was a satellite as I've seen them reflect the sun as they pass over."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"10/18/2013 11:05 UTC","Date Submitted":"10/18/2013 11:26 UTC","City":"Lindside","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lindside","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-80.669793","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51633.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51633.html"],"Region":"West Virginia","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.453734,+-80.669793(51633)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51633) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"51633","Summary":"Object made a long arc directional change","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"37.453734","Log Number":"US-10182013-0010"}
