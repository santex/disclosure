It looked like a shooting star but it wasn't in space. It was maybe 100 feet off the ground. It had a tail behind it but there was no smoke in the air after it disappeared from sight. It made no noise that we could hear, but we were watching television at the time so if it did produce any sound we couldn't hear it. I wouldn't have reported this at all but a friend of mine stopped by June 17th on his way back to Vancouver with his wife and baby and he said that he saw the same thing in the sky when they were staying at a cabin in Coleman,Alberta. He described the object exactly as we saw it. Just wondering if anybody else saw this and can identify it."],"Region":"British Columbia"}
