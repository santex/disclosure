I have sent my picture to numerous places to be anelized and have recieved only one responce from a well known ufo expert saying \"I cannot see anything of interest in the photo\". My email now is johnjones@live.ca for any assistance. I would like to have my picture looked at expecialy the origenal scan, professionaly. I know it is not faked, but at the worst it could be dubble exposed making the picture even more scarry and mysteryous. Thank you for looking :)"],"Latitude":"51.260835","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15554.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15554_submitter_file1__highlighted.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/15554_submitter_file2__Image1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15554.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular"}
