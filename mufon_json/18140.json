But apparently the object came suddenly into my sight of view, and carried on horizontally over the Sea (mediteranian) for at least 5 seconds. I assumed it would die out, like a normal meteorite, but it didn't. The object, carried on, and suddenly stopped briefly, then changed to a lower position (down), to carry on with it's path, (from south to north). The suddenly after dissapearing completely, it re-appeared briefly, to then move very fast more north, out of my field of view. I don't think it was a meteorite, just due to the fact, that it did not die out immediately, but carried on, with a change in trajectory. I had no camera at the time, sorry. Just hope that other people have noticed this. I'm currently on vacation in the South of Spain.
