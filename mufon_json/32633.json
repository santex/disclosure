{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside to take the dog potty. My son and I always look at the stars. We both saw this bright light moving form south to north. My son had noticed it first. He asked me why the star was so bright. It got my attention to say the least. We watched it move from close to the border north. At first I thought it might be a UAV from Ft. Huachuaca. We see quite a bite of those at night around here. It was not a UAV. After it got parallel with us it took an abrupt turn to the NW and was gone with crazy fast speed. I spent 8yrs in the army, and did 2 tours in Iraq. I have seen fighters in flight many times. I have never seen anything move that fast. Thank you for your time."],"Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Sierra Vista","There was one other sighting in Sierra Vista on or around October 13th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-10162011-0022","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Case Number":"32633","Date Submitted":"10/16/2011 08:24 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32633.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32633.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"31.477403","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-110.130037","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.477403,+-110.130037(32633)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32633) map </A>","Date of the Event":"10/13/2011 07:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arizona","Summary":"Bright light moving from South to North.","City":"Sierra Vista"}
