The first was flying very low, delta shaped and actually looked to be on fire. There was no sound, no propellers, no jet sounds and no rocket engine noises. It continued in a NNW Direction and we watched it till it moved out of sight. The object passed almost directly overhead. It was delta shaped and actually appeared to be on fire. It had an orage reddish glow. About a half hour later while the fireworks were going tyere was a second object that looked like the first on the same haeding but about 5 degrees to the west of the first. Same description, delta shaped and no sound. Orangish Red in color and appeared to be on fire. We watched until it continued out of sight. There were 7 of us and we all saw the same thing. Many people in the parking lot of the school where we were watching the fireworks were pointing into the sky so I know many people saw the same thing."],"trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Fort Wayne","There was one other sighting in Fort Wayne on or around July 4th 2010"],"Country":"United States"}
