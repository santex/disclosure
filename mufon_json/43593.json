Object coming out of the horizon caught my eye. The first one was triangle with orange lights at each corner. Looked quite large, but I have no idea how far away it was. Other orange objects were coming from the same spot, but seemed to be single, not triangular. They went up and then went to the Southeast, disappearing into the clouds. They were orange lights,standing on end like an 'I'. No flashing lights. I thought they were fireworks at first the way they came up from the horizon, but they never exploded and turned slowly. Still can't say that they weren't fireworks, but I have never seen anything like this before. I called the Three Rivers Police department and Dispatch in Centreville, but nothing was reported, they say. My husband also witnessed this event. Thanks."],"Object Shape":"Cylinder, Triangle","Longitude":"-85.692838","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"43593"}
