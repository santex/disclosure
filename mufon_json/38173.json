We were just talking and then looked up and saw three in the sky. We continued to observe and saw others appear as if from no where. Then they just disappeared into a cloud. They were moving onlyï»¿ slightly slower than a plane, but there was no sound at all. They did not appear to be floating lanterns due to the strange flight pattern.
