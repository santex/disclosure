{"Date of the Event":"02/20/2012 08:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Two bright lights hovering","Tags":"City","Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Swartz Creek","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on my way to work and where I live you can usually see the stars very well. When I walked outside I noticed an overcast and couldn't see the stars. As I was driving I noticed two lights. One appeared to be above the other but might not have been. I figured it was airplanes seeing that it was in the direction of the airport. Shortly after, one light moved above the other as the other remained stationary. When I arrived at work I got out and looked at the lights and noticed no blinking lights and they were way to bright to be stars especially with an overcast. The lights eventually disappeared after 15 minutes. I don't necessarily think it was aliens or anything crazy, but it is definitely interesting."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"36053","Date Submitted":"02/25/2012 04:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.959191,+-83.829474(36053)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36053) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36053.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36053.html"],"trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Swartz Creek","There were no other sightings in Swartz Creek on or around February 20th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-83.829474","Log Number":"US-02252012-0003","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.959191"}
