My observation lasted through 50 degrees,horizontally inonly 7 seconds,at most.I estimated that the craft would have travelled fromhorizon to horizon in less than 20 seconds.I also estimated that probably,aBB,held at arms length,would cover it well.It flew on a straight course, with nostops,starts,zig-zags,or any other course changes.This sighting was my fourthand none of the other sightings were in any way similar to this one."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Log Number":"","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1786.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1786.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Campbellton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"05/18/2002 02:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.669444","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.650278,+-84.669444(1786)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1786) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Campbellton","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"05/18/2002 02:20 UTC","Latitude":"33.650278","Weather Factors":"Windy"}
