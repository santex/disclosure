(large body of water attached to lake ontario) directly over the bay was an object flying east just at cloud level. it was moving very quickly. it was a bright round ball with a thin long black line behind it. the tail was straight as an arrow, with no fins or rudders, almost like a pole sticking out behind it. i figure it was traveling near speeds of 500 mph or more. within seconds of us seeing it, the object simply vanished after flying easterly for about 10 to 15 seconds. the sky was very clear with scattered puffy clouds. nothing to hide it from sight. i was driving and i also never had my camera with me. included is an example that i rendered of the event. this is about 90% close to what we saw. in deseronto i will add is a small craft airport and this was not any cessna or hang glider\\ultralight nor helicopter. i ever have seen before. it was way to quick. i kick my ass for not having my camera with us. things you see when you don't have it. live and learn. remember this is just a rendering, not actual picture. i tried to duplicate weather conditions and craft to the best of my ability. i thought i would share this with you. any thoughts?"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-08072009-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"44.197476","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
