Looking up, to the South, I saw an orange, bright star like object moving briskly , going north. At first I figured it was an airplane, but I noticed it had no blinking lights and was moving very swiftly. The light from it wasn't pulsing or anything either. It wasn't making any noise, and it is a clear night. I called for my wife, who came out and also observed it. It went right over our house, and passed the edge of our roof out of view. I ran into the yard and caught a glimpse of it before it completely disappeared. It had no blinking lights, but I got the impression it's altitude wasn't very high."],"Region":"California","Summary":"Bright Orange silent Venus sized object moving south to north over home, fairly fast, appeared fairly low","Date Submitted":"03/29/2008 08:34 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-03282008-0009","Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Porterville","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-119.014328","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.07483,+-119.014328(10081)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10081) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10081.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10081.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10081.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/29/2008 08:34 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
