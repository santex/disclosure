As it got closer I yelled for my daughter to bring her phone so we could maybe get a picture. Well of all times for her phone to be dead. We kept watching it float across the sky and not in a straight line. The lower it got we could see it had pointed shapes sticking out. Longer points were in the back. WE watched it in awe when all of a sudden it vanished before our eyes.. We asked each other where had it gone??? I am glad my daughter got to see this with me. I will keep watching the sky like I always do because I know it will return."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17251.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17251.html"],"Log Number":"US-05302009-0011","City":"Victoria","Latitude":"28.815127","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Summary":"I looked up to the sky and saw a dark object gliding getting closer.
