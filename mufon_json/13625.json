do i dare get back on the road and chance an abduction? i hung out in the convenience store for a few minutes and came out hoping that the object had moved on but it was still there just outside the few lights in this small town. was i the only person who had seen this strange object? why did it not just keep moving? after waiting outside for a few more minutes a tour bus pulled over at the same convenience store and parked for a few minutes. i thought that i would just wait until the tour bus pulled out and follow him to the border. if anything strange happened on the next stretch of road--at least there will be witnesses on the bus. about the same time the tour bus was pulling out an 18 wheeler came through town with 2 cars behind him. as the bus pulled out behind them, i was right on the bus' bumper. there was no way that i was going to let these vehicles out of my sight after this craft had been tracking me for 40 miles. the object resumes its course as soon as i pulled out of la pryor. now it was following an 18 wheeler, 2 cars, a tour bus and myself in my rental car. these other drivers were not wasting time, in fact the tour bus passed the 2 cars on this 2 lane highway and i was pleased just to keep them all in sight. our little convoy went for about 10 miles until suddenly the craft abandoned its parrallel course with the road and took a more southernly route and took off at a much faster speed. i watched it until it moved out of sight heading for mexico. i became convinced that i was being singled out for a possible abduction. certainly glad that it never came to that. i made the final leg of the trip without any further incident and checked into the holiday inn express in eagles pass as planned. needless to say, i did not get much sleep that night thinking about my trip to this border town."],"Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
