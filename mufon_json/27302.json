{"Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy roommate and I were having a bonfire on our three acres of land when suddenly we looked up in the sky and saw a long, four sided, cube shaped glowing trail across the sky. My first thought was \"this must be some kind of wormhole or energy contrail from some kind of craft.\" We looked up and noticed that the trail seemed to go on for miles, it was staying completely still and it wasnt dissapating. I believe we witnessed a wormhole event. As we have witnessed UFOs before in large clusters over our land and glowing skies after they passed overhead, I believe this event to be related."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-01082011-0006","Date Submitted":"01/08/2011 12:09 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.712108,+-80.223082(27302)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27302) map </A>","Summary":"Large miles long glowing wormhole in night sky","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/07/2011 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27302.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27302.html"],"City":"Royal Palm Beach","Case Number":"27302","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"26.712108","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Royal Palm Beach","There were no other sightings in Royal Palm Beach on or around January 7th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.223082","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
