I heard a noise above the house,then noticed the noise getting closer and closer, louder and louder. The housestarted to shake and glass window panes rattled. I sat up in bed, looked at theclock....3 a.m. I noticed that it looked bright outside, like daylight. Everything was glowing bright white, more intense than the sun. I got out of bedand went to another window and climbed out on the roof and searched the sky, butthe lights and noise were gone. I was too frightened to stay home that night. I called the police and the National Weather Bureau, to see if there was anearth quake or if they noticed weird sightings on their radar. No! They gaveme the UFO Hotline, toll free number to report my experience."],"Case Number":"1611","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1611.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1611.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Grand Ledge","Region":"Michigan","Date of the Event":"02/28/1987 03:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Source":"MUFON"}
