I saw a bright light in the sky that I thought was a small plane next thing, i thought it crashed into the ocean near the surf. As I got closer I realized it was not a plane and did not crash. I was relieved it was not a crashed plane but i was anxious. I saw a bright light just over the water. Next I saw a round, metallic object ascend from beneath the ocean and hover over it. The water swirled around it when it rose out above the water. There was a bright light beam underneath what looked like a craft. i had my iphone and took pictures. I don't even recall the craft leaving. I remember it was completely silent I didn't look at the pictures until months later I don't know why I waited so long. I don't really remember taking pictures which is why I haven't reported this until now. I figure an expert can explain the pictures because I cannot. This has bothered me since. I've had several nightmares of a UFO hovering over me and sending a beam of light after me. I wake up frightened. I feel scared writing this now."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"41.637381","Date of the Event":"10/15/2010 10:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
