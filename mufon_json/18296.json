{"Country":"United Kingdom","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["sighting detailsok���at approximately 1 am , i took my dog mishka out to our back court to do the toilet , i stood outside for a while looking up at the night sky , i had to keep holding my hand up to block out some of the light from our back court lights , but in any case i���m looking up at the sky and deliberately waiting for the ufo���s to show up ��� ** i quite literally see ufo���s on an annual basis here in glasgow , always the same kind , small star like objects , flying at various speeds and directions , size and colour can vary , from being a small very dim stars to large bright golden orbs of light , in recent years though they have increased vastly in number and have also started to show up in formation , normally a v shape** i haven���t seen anything all year , and in the last week or so the weather as been rather bad , the night sky���s have nearly always been overcast , but tonight the sky is clear enough to get a good look at the stars . so anyway there i am standing there and waiting to see if the ufo will show up ��� i don���t know if this has some significance or importance , but i can sort of feel that they will , its like there���s a sense of expectation in the air , so i continue to stand there and let my eye���s fully adjust to the night sky , i���ve been waiting for about 10 min , when suddenly i seen a very dim star move across the sky , directly above and in front of me , moving from west to east ��� i fully admit i feel a sense of relief when i see it , the idea of it not showing up ���i don���t really know i think it would worry me be it would mean that something has changed ��� in any case i decide to go inside and get my hat ( to help block out the light from the back court and save me from using my hand ) , i come back outside and wait for a further 5 or so minutes , but i don���t see anything , i figure what the hell���i go inside grab my coat , my office chair and a strong pair of binoculars . i settle down and wait ��� after about 5 min , i see a small star quickly fly ���from what i can see of the middle of the sky , south westerly , heading in the direction of the hill , a few minutes later an almost identical star does the exact same thing ���i try to view them through the binoculars , but they���re moving far too quickly . i wait for a little while longer and decide to take my chair and binoculars inside , i go back outside to the back court and have a smoke ��� within minutes , i see four stars flying in ���what i can only call a swirling v formation , and they head in the same direction as the previous two ���i had to laugh because it looked like one of the stars was playing catch up with the others , falling into formation and then lagging behind before trying to catch up again . i follow their path till they fly behind the rooftops out of sight ���curious as to where they���re all going , i wait a little longer , then see another star like object fly from the south into the north ���jokingly i say to myself ���ok next ��� and then another one shows up right on cue following a similar path as the previous one .( maybe it was the two that where heading south in the direction of the hill i don���t know but these ones looked a little brighter ) , i wait a little longer to see if any more show up and i see another flying from what i can tell quite high in the sky ..moving in a sort of north-easterly direction ��� at this i go back inside at around 1:30 am , though i���m absolutely sure if i stayed out any longer i���d see more and i���m even toying with the idea of going back outside . now i don���t know what these are ..but they certainly don���t seem like any ufo i���ve ever hard anybody else describe , i���m trying desperately to find a way of describing how they move ��� they move in a very quick but very graceful fashion , almost like how an insect fly���s through the air , as for size , well as i���m sure you can guess , judging a small fast moving point of light in the sky is very difficult . height���at my best guess , 20 \\30 feet above the electricity pylons , maybe more , at times i get the impression that they aren���t very big , maybe a few feet across at best the size of a small car seen at a distance . i know my eye���s aren���t playing tricks on me and i���m not mistakenly picking out insects that get caught reflecting light , best way i can describe is to say that they are balls of light , flying at a distance , but like i say it almost impossible for me to really judge their size and distance . so all in tonight in the space of half an hour ���maybe a little more , i���ve seen no less than 10 ufo���s , buzzing about the sky ��� 1 ) i live in a two story building , i live on the ground floor , we have a large back court area that faces a large wood directly north of my building , some open ground before you reach the trees , holds power pylons that branch off east and west and a power substation , i was standing in the back court with my dog , looking up at the night sky . 2 ) to cut a long story short its something i���ve known about for a very long time , i���ve become very accustomed to seeing these ���what i can only describe as flying stars . 3 ) well as i say , i���ve known about them for a great many years , i don���t know what they are , but over the years i���ve ruled out everything , they don���t fly like any conventional aircraft as they seem to move in an almost fluid and organic fashion , i know they are intelligent due to past experience , at one point one of them made a point of grabbing myself and two friends attention by flashing \\ blinking at us , only until we where all giving it our full attention , did it make a point of flying away , at first slowly and then at impossible speeds . 4 ) on this sighting they where all flying in different directions through the sky , the formation of four looked as though it was a swirling \\ rotating v formation ���with a single one , flying into , and then lagging out of the formation , i���ve noticed in recent years they have started to move in a very fluid like way , its hard to explain , but if they happen to be lower than normal ( normal being very high up ) , they almost wobble when they move ���the best way i can describe it is to say they fly much like a housefly or insect would . 5 ) well i have become very accustomed to them , i know this is gonna sound completely unbelievable , but if you���ve seen these things as much as i have , you become used to them , though i will say there was a sense of anticipation in the air , it was like i could feel that they where going to make an appearance . 6 ) the simply fly out of sight , or so far away that i can no longer see them ."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18296.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18296.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"GB-07252009-0011","Date
