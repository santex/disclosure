It was wobbling around high in the sky. It was somewhat reminiscent of an eye. Very bright white in the center like a star but brighter than any other star. there where four yellow rays fanning down and four yellow rays pointing up. It slowly drifted up and to the south all the while wobbling side to side and up and down. The oldest part is when viewed through binoculars it appeared completely different. It presented like a triangular emerald with the point down. From the point came down a yellow bolt almost like lightning. directly under the bolt was a white chevron. At firs I was excited to again see a UFO. I then began to become let down as nothing more happened."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07092011-0004","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-122.667207","Country":"United States","Region":"Oregon","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.531132,+-122.667207(30064)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30064) map </A>","City":"Portland"}
