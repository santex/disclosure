We were in the campground that faces the lake. We were facing approx. SE. The campfire was in front of us. I can't remember if there was a moon or not, but there were no clouds at all in the sky. We both were looking at the sky and I noticed a bright, white and round shape getting brighter and brighter, about a hand width above the mountains and about the size of a marble (distance perspective). All of sudden it flashed brightly and disappeared. I turned to my husband and said, \"Did you see that?\" He said, \"Uh huh.\" and nodded his head. We weren't scared as for there were other campers in the vicinity. We just thought it was a great experience. *I just learned about MUFON very recently and I had no idea how to research our experience. I have looked on the web and have found nothing. Thank you very much."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.655263,+-106.828651(11181)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11181) map </A>"}
