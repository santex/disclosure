The light is stationary and is over northeast Boulder currently. Maybe the northern lights? I am not sure if they could be seen in Colorado. The light has remained in place for about 30 minutes, it is still there as i type. I woke my wife to witness this light too. I left a 9 news tip as well for a local news channel in my area. Hoping that other people may see this light too."],"Date of the Event":"08/09/2011 11:40 UTC","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Boulder","There were no other sightings in Boulder on or around August 9th 2011"],"City":"Boulder","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08102011-0006","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
