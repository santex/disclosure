{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were fishing on Vancouver Island near Port McNeill, and we were coming in to get some fuel for the boat at Telegraph Cove. We were going through a channel where a riptide was present and I wanted to get a picture of it. Later on, after downloading the photo onto my computer, my son noticed something wierd in the upper left section of this particular photo. I couldn't identify it other than that it appeared to be a UFO. I wasn't going to report it as we didn't witness it in real time, but after hearing about this other one at O'Hare in Chicago, I remembered that I have a picture and decided to send it to you guys. It's not a bad pic, considering that I wasn't focusing on it. I'm sure the photo enhancing software that you guys have would probably be better than what I have. This pic that I have has not been altered or enhanced in any way.
