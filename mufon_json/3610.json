A few moments later my husband and I noticed an airplane (looked like military type) flying in the same direction where I last saw the object. When I saw the object, I knew right away it wasn't a plane or helicopter. I was mesmerized by it, trying to decided what it was. When it disappeared I knew it wasn't normal."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-119.010782","Latitude":"35.378982","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"a shining object in the sky disappears as it moves","Date Submitted":"07/20/2005 05:40 UTC","Object Features":"Dome","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/20/2005 05:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3610.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3610.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Oval","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Case Number":"3610","City":"Bakersfield","Log Number":"US-07202005-0003","trends":["There have been 32 other sightings in Bakersfield","There were no other sightings in Bakersfield on or around July 20th 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
