It was not lit up, it was a grey dark silver color. It was too high to be a balloon and it did not move. After 7 minutes I asked my dad to look at it. He was puzzled and continued to watch for about 5 mins. then it started to move and with in 30 seconds it was gone. My father was in the airforce and he was actually very surprised by what he saw, myself as well.. I have seen ufos befor, never in the day light..... thank you"],"Log Number":"US-02242009-0022","Date Submitted":"02/17/2009 04:24 UTC"}
