{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was about 8 years old in 1972 living in a 4 family flat in Highland Park Mi on Glendale a new family had moved in from Texas and i became friend with a girl my age I slept over that night, about sometime in the early a.m. I awakend to use the rest room and got out of bed the rest room was located on the right side of the room I was sleeping in at the end of the hall and the hall was shaped like in L. I heard a noise a door moving I walked to the long side of the hall to see who was awake with me the light shinning from the bathroom located on my right side allowed me to see what I thought was a small child holding onto a door knob peering out from behind the door I could see his sillouhette and I thought wow! he must be hungry he looked skinny so I took a step closer blinking my eyes as to clear up my sleepy vision and as my vision became more clear I turned my head to the left and it mimicked me and that's when I saw the eye it was large and black so I turned my head to the right and it mimmicked me again and the mouth and nose tiny slits for a nose and a dimple for a mouth appeared from behind the door and then i noticed the 3long fingers holding the door knob and it had no clothes on I could only see its one shoulder and its skin although dark in hall with only the light from the rest room appeared to be grey a dark grey ----I took a deep breath and urinated on a oldfshioned wax floor the kind that leave water spots the urine ran down my left leg and I fainted I woke the next morning and remember I urinated on the floor but there was no evidence and I didn't know why I would do that my underware were bright white almost glowing and I was back in the bed, no urine in the bed -- I felt no need to tell my mom or my friend that I urinated in the hall there was no proof the wax floor was not dammaged and my undies were better than new and so smell I did not know why I did it, it was like a dream-- Well fast forward to 1986 14 years later--Time Life Magazine advertised a give-a-way book Aliens are they really out there and flashed a picture of the alien and I was 8years old again stading in the hall re-living eveything over again like a time warp - they are here they have been here for years they could restore the floor because there was an example to go by but they could not restore by undies because they did not know what they looked like before i soiled them they were glowing white that next morning- for two weeks I could not walk that year I forgot about that a Relative told me I believe there is a chip in my leg may they hit an important nerve inserting it and there was deep inditation there for some time I gained so much weight its hard to see now - I'm not crazy.- This happened to me and I will not go on acting as if it did not - there is more to the story the family I was visiting came from Texas from a farm and after many years I saw them again and told them my story and they confirmed it to be true a family member commited suicide as a result of watching the alien move about the residence quite fequently in the evenings he was born after I lost touch with my friend it was a younger brother to her he was dead before I saw her again - they did not beleive him so he killed himself I wish I could have been there because I saw the alien I would have beleived him."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Michigan","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Highland Park","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"07/31/1975 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-83.096868","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01302007-0007","City":"Highland Park","Summary":"it was a alien","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6272.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6272.html"],"Latitude":"42.405592","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.405592,+-83.096868(6272)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6272) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/31/1975 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"6272","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
