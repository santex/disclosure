I turned around and saw a single small light moving slowly just above the tree level. The light was clearly on the bottom of a larger object but I couldn't make out the shape against the night sky. I figured it was just on the bottom of a helicopter or private tour plane but was perplexed when I didn't hear any noise from the engine. As we continued to watch the light passed over head and suddenly a spotlight turned on and was focused on me for a second or two and the focused on my cousin and then turned off. The craft then proceded to move slowly in the same direction and disappear behind the trees."],"Date of the Event":"08/15/2005 11:00 UTC"}
