{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I took pictures of the sunset at The Aerie, west of Doe Mountain in Sedona, Arizona. While we were waiting for the sun to set, I took pictures of the surrounding area. Neither my husband nor I witnessed any object in the sky while I was taking the attached shot. Tonight I transferred the photos from my camera to my computer and I found a shot with an object that I cannot identify. I am hoping a photo expert can rule out a cloud or a flying bug."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/17/2013 10:41 UTC","Longitude":"-111.75828","Log Number":"US-09172013-0012","City":"Sedona","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"50883","Region":"Arizona","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.87705,+-111.75828(50883)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50883) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/16/2013 06:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Sedona","There were no other sightings in Sedona on or around September 16th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50883.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50883.html"],"Summary":"Taking pictures of sunset at The Aerie near Sedona's Doe Mountain","Tags":"City","Latitude":"34.87705"}
