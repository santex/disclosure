even though it had no wings. suddently there is a huge blue flash that lights up the sky and it comes from the direction that we saw the \"jet\" go. it streaks across the sky lit up and the same shape at lightning speed and it stops right in front of us across the lake and sits there, now just looking like a star or planet. \"meteorites\" are everywhere. when it lit up you could see the blue and red lights at the back of it as it streaked across the sky. it was so fast it left a trail of itself behind it. i panic and drive off and the kids are complaining loudly that i am taking them away from this event that is once in a lifetime. i tell them i want their dad and i go to get him! i wake him up and he mumbles and goes back to sleep. the kids are waiting in the truck, keeping an eye on the light that lumed there. i feel like a heel, but i am terrified at the thought of taking them back there to the unknown, but i do anyway. first i stop at my brothers, wake him up and take him with us back down to the lakeside. we park the same way facing the lake but as far back from it as possible. as we sit there, we start to see them. there are at least four maybe more. there are two hovering on the lake and one comes out from the trees on the otherside and goes straight up and hovers there. it moves up and down up and down over a little then up and down. there are more over on the other side glowing through the trees. the fog appears again. then the one on the left of us which is hovering on the lake and is a long strip of lights with what looked like a search light in the center starts to get too close. my kids are in the back of the truck and i fear for them so i start to drive off. my brother wants me to stop and look for a minute more. i do this and then leave. i dropped my brother off and we went into his place to discuss what we saw. then i go home and my husband is up. my kids continue to watch out the window and see the one on the lake which we now know was the one that lured us down there to begin with. it is glowing and from that distance you can only see the search light thing. i asked my husband to go and see with me, because i really wanted him to experience what we did. finally after about half an hour he asks if i want to go. we did. as we were heading down to the lake he saw a very large black shape (the size of our town) over the lake and then it faded out. after that he only got to see the one on the lake by the mine and the strange fog that took over the whole area immediately after we got there. we could hear what he thought was the barge starting up, which would be it heading over to the other side of the lake for the first run. after that we saw no more activity. we drove up to my moms because he thought we could get a better view from her driveway. we sat there for a few minutes when i saw in the sky above the lake what looked like red and green lights flashing. it flew from the burns lake side of the lake toward smithers but not following the lake like i saw the other lower craft. this one was much higher and sounded jetlike. suddenly the fog got huge and glowing white. it came up so fast and then it began coming toward us. we went home and in the two minutes that took, the fog totally covered our town. my kids were at the kitchen window and had just seen a light hovering above the neighbour house behind us. they described it as a solid white orb. i am attaching a picture of the view of lake from our porch. it is the view we saw the light that lured us to the lake."],"Log Number":"CA-02122008-0012","Date of the Event":"12/11/2007 02:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc, Sphere, Other","Region":"British Columbia","City":"Granisle"}
