I got on to state road 80 and started heading east. As soon as I got on the road I noticed a blinking light I figured it was some plane and didn't think to much about it. When I first saw the object it was about eight miles.I kept driving and the object seemed to be stationary and it wasn't moving. I got within a mile or so the object started moving at a cars speed. It was following the road and there was alot traffic going east and west. I saw the object had a blinking light on the top of it I figured it was probably a helicopter. I kept driving and then I noticed the object started to slow down a little. Then I driving right next to it and then I knew it was something else. It had the blinking light on the top and then it had five lights underneath it. The lights were going around in a pattern I have never seen before. About six to five miles away from getting on to U.S. 27 the object crossed the road and started heading north I turn to look at the road and I looked back and it was gone. I never got a good look to see what the object's shape because it was already dark outside."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"Weird.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17743.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17743.html"],"Log Number":"US-06302009-0013","Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/22/2009 08:28 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.665917,+-81.509754(17743)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17743) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/22/2009 08:28 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":[],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Latitude":"27.665917"}
