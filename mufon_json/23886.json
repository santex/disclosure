We had noticed one or two shooting stars. All of the sudden the sky lights up so brightly that at first I thought it was lightning, and realize that its not because its completely clear. I see an enormous silver object shooting across the sky. things are breaking off of it and the tail is tremendous. its so bright it makes you squint. it was like looking at a flame on a welder. The craziest thing is that about 1 minute later, we heard this very loud boom noise. It was very dull but very very loud. And we both were said it unison \"It crashed!\". not sure if it was a satellite or a meteor but it definately crashed somewhere nearby. Just wondering if anyone could have saw the same thing."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.692183,+-82.007854(23886)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23886) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06222010-0003","Country":"United States","Region":"North Carolina","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/21/2010 01:45 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"23886","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Marion","There were no other sightings in Marion on or around June 21st 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23886.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23886.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","City":"Marion","Tags":"City","Summary":"Enormous crashing ball of silvery light.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.692183","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
