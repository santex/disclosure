I knew there was a meteor shower occurring that night and over the next few nights. After dark, I think it was around 10:30, a group of us decided to go out to the amphitheater right next to the lake for best, unobstructed viewing on the Scout reservation to watch for meteors. It was a warm, clear, cloudless night. We saw a few meteors but then, out of the south, southwest, a small whitish-green object came from the horizon over the tree tops on a straight path toward the north, northeast. As a scout, I had seen plenty of night sky objects in my years of camping and at first thought it was a satellite; it was about the same size and brightness and traveled along an approximate north-south, straight line at a constant speed just like every other satellite I have seen. However, things changed as soon as it got directly overhead, nearly at the center of the sky from our viewpoint. It came to a dead stop. Of course, at this point, it got our attention. There were no flashing lights as one might expect with conventional aircraft, no sounds, nothing. The object seemed to be at a very high altitude so we weren���t scared but just kept watching in amazement. It remained at the center of the sky for a moment or so and then began to vibrate wildly, back and forth, side to side, in circles, all while remaining in the relative center of the sky. These movements lasted no more than a few minutes. Then, almost instantaneously, the object zipped to the north-northeastern corner of the sky, swelled to approximately 5 times its size (to my eye, the object was first the size of a large star and swelled to approximately the size of a tic-tac), turned bright red, and shot off to the northwest faster than anything I have ever seen. These movements were so fast, they were almost unbelievable. As I have told this story over the years a few times, I have attempted to convey the speed at which this object moved. The only way I can come close to describing it is to use a laser pointer to replicate the objects movements on the ceiling of the room I am in while telling the story. After the object shot off, we all discussed what we had seen but mostly our comments were, ���Did you guys just see that too?��� and ���What the hell was that?��� We all agreed that it was not a meteor that we had seen performing such radical flight. Being young teenagers, it didn���t seem to bother us that we had no idea what we had just seen in the sky and we decided to stay and continue to watch the meteor shower. About 5-10 minutes later, we noticed another object similar to the first unknown object appear on the horizon to the southeast. It was moving to the northwest at the same, constant rate of speed as the first. We thought, this time, this object must be a satellite. A moment later, yet another object appeared on the horizon opposite and began to move to the southeast and it appeared the two objects were on an intercept course. As the two objects approached each other, I felt nervous; it began to dawn on me that if these were vehicles not of Earth, there might be a chance they know we are watching them. I don���t know if the others had the same feelings ��� we were pretty silent at this point, I guess in near disbelief of what we were observing. As the two objects nearly met, they stopped at the center of the sky in almost the same spot that the first object had stopped. Then as if as a means of communication ��� or at least that is what I have always thought was going on ��� they began to move around each other. It was like a dance. One would be still, no movement at all, and the other would go around it in circles so fast it was unbelievable. As I stated previously, the only way to accurately communicate what I observed is to use two laser pointers, hold one on the ceiling still and use the other to circle it as quickly as possible; however, I cannot reproduce the speed with which these two objects moved. Sometimes they just wiggled back and forth and other times they moved in patterns. Sometimes the two objects both moved at the same time. At one point, a smaller object, circular and a similar whitish-green, appeared to come out of one of the two objects, ���dance��� around like the other two larger objects, and then a moment later it appeared to be absorbed back into the object from It was summertime and I was working at the Boyscout camp.

This went on for about ten minutes. When it ended, it was as abrupt at the first object shooting off; the two objects became still and then zipped off in the directions from which they came. As soon as they were out of site, all of us agreed we had seen enough and we got up to go tell someone what we had seen. Of course, all of the older folks we told said it was ���heat lightning���, anything other than believing what we had witnessed. I am an educated person. I have flown in passenger aircraft, commercial flights and smaller, private Cessna-type aircraft.

No human-made aircraft that I am aware of can move at the speeds, change directions at those high speeds, change size, emit a light (not navigation or landing lights), or accelerate from absolute still to the horizon literally faster than a snap. which it appeared.
