{"divs":["sighting detailsoutside for our evening cigarette, star gazing as always. suddenly my boyfriend calls out that something flashed really bright in the southeastern sky. i immediately looked in the direction to see it begin to brighten into a flash that reminded us of a camera. it flashed\\brightened at least 3 times while it moved towards the north, each one was made up of two quick succession flashes. after these flashes the orb would fade nearly until you couldn't see it against the night sky then would begin the cycle over again. we noticed there were no bugs out when we first went out (10 mins prior) and after seeing the orb they came on really strong. not sure if there is a correaltion once the orb got over the top of our building and we couldn't see it anymore i turn around towards the direction it came, and there was a plane 10 degrees to the right of the original path. once the plane went over the building we had to come inside the flies were insane."],"Summary":"Bright Pulsating Orb","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","trends":[],"City":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.321774","Tags":"City","Case Number":"48402","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.263515,+-85.321774(48402)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48402) map </A>","Region":"Ontario","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48402.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48402.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/24/2013 10:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"CA-06242013-0028","Country":"Canada","Latitude":"51.263515","Date Submitted":"06/24/2013 10:44 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
