{"City":"Aurora","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out walking my dogs and was on the phone with my best friend when something shiny caught my eye. I looked up and there was a disc shaped object in the sky floating around. I asked her if she could see it from Lakewood Co where she was also walking her dogs, about 30 minutes away from me. She could not because she was underneath tree cover. I watched it move around and then it went almost straight up and was gone. I did not see it again. The sun was just setting and the reflection made it very easy to spot. The next evening my daughter and I were walking and saw something very similiar in the night sky 3 times. We felt excited and honored to have seen these."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.743596,+-104.869696(18474)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18474) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/22/2009 08:40 UTC","Case Number":"18474","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Aurora","There were no other sightings in Aurora on or around July 22nd 2009"],"Latitude":"39.743596","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/22/2009 08:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18474.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18474.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08042009-0010","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-104.869696","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"i saw it shimmering in the sunset","Region":"Colorado"}
