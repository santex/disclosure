It caught my attention because it was not moving along (like the rest of the airplanes). This happened about 7:05 PM, Jan 22, 2011.I reported it on facebook at 7:08, by which time it was gone. It was a large craft, with lots of lights, but the rotating (white)lights on the belly were predominantly obvious. The shape of the ufo must have been round, since the rotating lights went round and about. I was amazed that it hovered for so long. I ran to get my cellphone, took 3 pictures, but they didn't yield anything but darkness, eventhough i had gottan up on a ladder to get a higher position. I ran inside to scramble for my photo camera, but in vain. When I got back out it was gone. I wasn't afraid, or nervous, and there were no funny feelings. Howerver, I was taken by surprise and I was amazed at its audacity to hover for so long! Has anyone seen it? I would like to know."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Country":"United States","Case Number":"27483","Longitude":"-81.374216","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Shape":"Disc","Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/22/2011 08:08 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.545006,+-81.374216(27483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27483) map </A>","City":"Orlando","Log Number":"US-01222011-0009","Date of the Event":"01/22/2011 07:05 UTC"}
