Last night around 6:15 pm Mountain Time I was out walking and saw what looked like a star flare up to about the size of a full moon then quickly return to normal. I was starring at the star when it flared and it was still there when the flare went away. Looked like an explosion. Right after the flare I noticed a small light moving due west away from the star. No flashing lights it looked like a satelite moving across the sky. The flare was located due south of my position about four fist widths up from the horizon. The flare didn't move it started as a point of light expanded to about the size of the full moon then return to a point of light. Now it could have been an object in front of the star or near the star. Did anyone else see this event?"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"33477","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33477.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33477.html"]}
