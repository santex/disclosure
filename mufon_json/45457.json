It was moving from east to west, to slow to be a meteor, at quite a high altitude. It very well could have been something falling back to earth. It disappeared into the black above the horizon. I logged on to mufon to see if any one else saw it, and sure enough someone from Binghamton, 20 mins south did. Wonder if anyone further west saw it come down."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45457.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45457.html"]}
