We were working, hauling a load of junk vehicles to the wrecking yard. (please do not include that in the report though--I really don���t want anyone to know who we are) It was very cloudy but not raining and I���m not sure if it was windy or not. We were on hwy 62 getting ready to turn onto hwy 234 when I saw a shiny dot in the clouds just above the mountains. I tried to zoom in on it then and was not able to find it in the viewfinder. My husband couldn���t see it. I couldn���t find it or see it from hwy 234 but I kept scanning the sky. When we were on Modoc rd. I saw it again. It was going from shiny to dark to shiny to dark and I was having a hard time finding it in the viewfinder. My husband couldn���t find a good spot to pull over with the load we were hauling and still couldn���t see it. When I was able to find it and start recording it I was leaned over from the passenger side of the truck towards my husband looking between his face and the wind wing, the window was up. It was more of an oval or a cigar shape when I was zoomed in on it and I thought that when we got home and viewed it we would be able to see wings and be able to identify it as a plane. I thought it was moving south while I was watching it but when we viewed it on the tv it seemed to be staying in the same place. I stopped recording when some trees came in view and I couldn���t find it again. I don���t think it disappeared, I think it just went dark and I couldn���t see it again."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/20/2007 12:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in White City","There were no other sightings in White City on or around March 20th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
