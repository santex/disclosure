It was about the size of a bb held at arms length. It came from the west and kept going up and up and disintergrated into an orange ball. The orange ball also disappeared in less than a second. I see alot of planes because I live about 15 miles from the airport in Manitowoc WI. I don't believe this was a plane. I also wonder if this object landed somewhere in the west of my location."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"44.199439","Region":"Wisconsin","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Star like object ascends until it disappears"}
