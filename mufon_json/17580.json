The object I seen was HUGE!!!! It was a perfect triangle with 3 illuminated white lights to make 3 points as in the shape of a triangle. When I say HUGE I mean this thing had to be 500ft in every latteral length of the triangle. My reaction was holy crap I think I seen the space station, But up until recently i was at a gathering with friends and we were talking about this object and he mentioned there is no way the space station is that big......I can still see it in my mind like it was yesterday! It came from the NORTH WEST and cruised overhead an actual 30 seconds plain as day clear sky and eventually headed in a South Eastern direction. A visual was lost by eventually being too far away. If I could draw it it would be a perfect triangle with three illuminated dots on either joining latteral of the triangle. I am curious to know if it was the space station or not."],"City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/20/2008 01:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"CA-06212009-0002","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"06/20/2008 01:30 UTC"}
