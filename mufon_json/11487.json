We look through the tree line and see the moon, and a super bright star-like object to the right of the moon. The object was moving, yet it was moving so slow it took 2 hours for it to pass to the right into the tree line. We even joked saying at one point it must be beaming somebody up, because, at one point, there was a bright light that came down from the object. The next day my sister called me and told me she was looking for anything on the internet that might tell us what we were staring at all night. She found nothing, until a couple days later when she found four seperate reports of UFO activity. That is what brings me to this site right now. I believe I have seen a UFO in the past, however, it was more of a fireball look and disappeared quickly from the sky. This was very different. I hope I gave a detailed enough description of that night."],"Log Number":"US-07082008-0014","Date of the Event":"06/22/2008 04:00 UTC"}
