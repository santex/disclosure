Kept observing because the color was unusual for an aircraft. It was traveling in towards the southwest over LA Harbor. after about two minutes of travel, it began circling very tightly. Too tight for a terrestrial-based craft, I believe. I dug in my pocked for my phone to snap a photo, but by the time I had, it ascended into the cloud coverage that morning."]}
