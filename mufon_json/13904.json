It appeared to be self laminated and moving rapidly towards Andromeda before fading out of sight. It had no blinking lights as an airplane would. In my opinion the speed of the object coupled with the fact that its shape never changed and the time in which it appeared rules out birds or animals capable of flight. I have been a keen watcher of the sky for many years and have NEVER seen anything like this in my entire life! The object was only in view for approximately 5 seconds."],"Longitude":"-84.163162","Case Number":"13904","Date Submitted":"11/23/2008 01:32 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Leesburg","There were no other sightings in Leesburg on or around November 23rd 2008"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"31.740616","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Georgia","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Leesburg","Log Number":"US-11232008-0001","Summary":"Fast moving UFO.","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.740616,+-84.163162(13904)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13904) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc","Date of the Event":"11/23/2008 01:32 UTC"}
