I got out of the tent and looked around but seen nothing so I got back inside. The light flashed again. I ignored it this time but then a few minutes later it flashed me again. I got out of the tent and when I moved the flash of light would follow me. I finally started to look up and saw a yellow circle above the clouds doing circles and then traveling past the highway and back then going up and coming back down again. then it made another circle or too and flashed me again. I took off and went to an area where I could get a full view of the nearby airport to see if that was the light There was no light like that that I could see. The wole thing lasted about a hour and a half. I havent been that scared in a long time.
