When i noticed a star like object moving across the sky pretty fast, then suddenly it stopped. Then dissapeared. It was moving in a westarly direction not changing course, just smoothly traveling west. Until it stopped then vanished. I thought it could have been a plane but it had no colours comming from it, (just a white star like object) it was very high up so that just made me believe it could have been the International Space Station however i'am doubtful it could just disappear. To be honest i didnt think much of it until i seen it disappear. When it did i felt quite... excited and also curious at what it was."],"Latitude":"57.153377","Sighting Duration":"00:00:12","Summary":"a star like object moving through the sky, stopped then vanished.","Region":"Scotland","Date of the Event":"11/03/2010 06:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=57.153377,+-2.085838(26349)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26349) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26349.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26349.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Aberdeen","There were no other sightings in Aberdeen on or around November 3rd 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
