I have to focus on a part of the sky and then I see them. This morning I saw 5 of them but one of them was moving through the sky when all of a sudden it glowed very bright(as bright as the sun) for about 5 seconds and then went back to a faint star look. It's not shooting stars I'm seeing I used to think it was satellites but this one to become that bright for about 5 seconds and then fade back to its original brightness and continue to move slowly through the sky made me question that."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were no other sightings in Philadelphia on or around December 2nd 2008"],"Log Number":"US-12022008-0002","Date of the Event":"12/02/2008 05:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.961915,+-75.155149(14185)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14185) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/02/2008 05:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14185.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14185.html"],"Case Number":"14185"}
