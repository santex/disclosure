Not more then 15 mins later (girl friend had gone inside in the time frame from the first spotting to the second) I saw it again, looked like a star flashing, I kept watching to see if it had a pattern like an airplane strobe. flashed once... twice...three times then it completely disappeared. the pause between flashes was random, not in unison like an airplane flashes were like: Flash........flash...........................flash the time frame in between the second and third flash was long enough to almost make me think it was gone but it flashed that last time and I did not see it again."],"Summary":"flashing lights","Longitude":"-97.127874","Object Flight Path":"Other","Date of the Event":"09/03/2013 10:15 UTC","Region":"Manitoba","Log Number":"CA-09032013-0003","Date Submitted":"09/03/2013 01:28 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"49.907144","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50383.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50383.html"],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"50383","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Winnipeg","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.907144,+-97.127874(50383)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50383) map </A>","Country":"Canada"}
