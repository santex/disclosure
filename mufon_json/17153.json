There was only a few very small clouds almost a 100% clear night. I did not see where the flash came from and I thought it came from the south. My girlfriend did see it and said it was from the north but whatever it was it was very bright. It started out as a pulsing flash like lightning off in the distance. It pulsed and then ended with one very bright flash. I stood up and looked behind me to see if there was any vapor trail from a possible meteor entry but there was nothing. My girlfriend also said it left no trail... just disappeared. I waited to hear if there was any sound but no rumble was heard. I checked the weather radar and it there was nothing around for a hundred miles."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/24/2009 11:30 UTC"}
