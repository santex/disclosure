He said \"look at those bright stars\" I looked and thought those were too bright for stars. Just then the two stars moved about an inch or so at great speeds and I thought at that distance they couldn't be an airplane. A third gently came to light just as bright. They formed a triangle for a minute maybe minute and a half. We just stared because we never saw \"stars\" move or fade in and out of brightness like that. The trianle moved into a straight formation for about a minute or 1.5 minutes. This is the second \"star like\" movement I have seen in the last two years. I live near a regional airport so I am very familiar with night flights and lights of planes. These moved to fast for any planes I have seen or heard of. I would like to know if anyone else has seen these lights in the northern Nashville area on this date as well. Thank you for your site."]}
