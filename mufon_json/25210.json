I am in Washington state. I was on the corner of Bellevue Way and Main street facing south east. I looked out to see if it was a cloudy night and I saw that the stars were out. The first star i noticed was a bright one ,the size of Venus. I assumed that it was a planet until i saw that it was moving. I yelled at my friends that it was a U.F.O , but they went inside anyway. I stood watching , looking for a flashing light or some sound and i got neither. I watched it go from the southern part of the sky heading north.An airplane passed over it, and i wondered if they might collide.The object was clearly below the plane ,the plane was not at cruising altitude. we have a lot of air traffic around here. I yelled for my other friend to come outside , i asked her what she thought it was as it was moving away from us. She said the same things i thought (no blinking light, no sound). We watched as it disappeared in to the clouds. People were walking by , and no one stopped.
