It was getting cloudy. My balcony faces Redondo Beach and I live about 2 miles from the ocean. I saw a large object slowly flying south towards PV and then out to the ocean which is west. So, I took out my phone camera and took two photos. I blew them up so you could see how large the object was. I thought it could be a blimp or plane. But, it was too fast for a blimp and too slow for a plane It was flashing alot of red, blue and yellow lights. I got the pics of it while the clouds were going over it."],"Log Number":"US-10092013-0009","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"Possible UFO over Redondo Beach Trench?","Longitude":"-118.367126"}
