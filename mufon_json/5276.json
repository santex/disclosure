It moved from West to East at approximately 6:20 in the evening of Aug 19, 2006. I thought it sounded like a jet engine so was surprised to see an egg shaped object whose wings alternately appeared then disappeared repeatedly over several minutes. The object eventually disappeared behind clouds on the eastern horizon. The sun was setting but did not seem to reflect off of the object which was somewhat darker than the clouds."],"Region":"Connecticut","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"I saw an egg shaped object slowly move across the sky in North Haven, CT.","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5276.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5276.html"],"Object Shape":"Egg","Date Submitted":"08/19/2006 06:20 UTC"}
