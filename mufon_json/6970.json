I was driving down a hill and looked up. And there it was floating in the sky. It was a metallic color and cigar shaped. It was not an airplane. It was close enough to see that it was not one. It was lower than airplanes usually fly, so you could see that it had no wings. I first noticed it when I was driving and something told me to look up. When I first saw it I didn���t know what to think. It was a chunk of metal hovering in the sky. When I realized that it had no wings, I got a huge rush of adrenaline. When I looked at it more and noticed the shape and color. First thing I did was note the time. My girlfriend was in the car, but at the angle she was at she could not see it. I told her & she tried but couldn���t. I tried to follow it, but the road cut off. It went out if sight in the trees."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6970.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6970.html"],"trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Tyler","There were no other sightings in Tyler on or around April 28th 2007"],"Date of the Event":"04/28/2007 11:32 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/28/2007 11:32 UTC"}
