Since it was dark my camera (Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi) used an exposure time of 10 seconds. An airplane flew through the field of view that had solid and flashing lights, which when viewed in the 10 second photo appeared as 2 parallel lines and dots. I am a certified moron, so I thought I would report this as a UFO."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 136 other sightings in Toronto","There was one other sighting in Toronto on or around October 25th 2012"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/27/2012 10:12 UTC","Case Number":"43549","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.784006,+-79.227792(43549)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43549) map </A>","Country":"Canada","Summary":"Flat DNA looking UFO","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"10/25/2012 09:55 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cigar","Longitude":"-79.227792","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43549.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43549.html"],"Latitude":"43.784006","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
