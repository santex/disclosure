Approx. every second there would be a white flash from near the middle of the object. Object was fairly large - about an inch long from where I was. After maybe 5 minutes another of the same objects, color, size and actions the same, appeared off to the side a bit, but lower down than the first one. This second object was only visible for 10-15 seconds and vanished. I continued watching for over an hour, then it seemed to get smaller as if it were moving off to the west, so I quit watching I knew this was not a plane for it did not move, and even a helicopter would not remain stationary that long. Also if it were a star or satellite it would have moved."],"Log Number":"US-08042010-0008","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"38.135657","Longitude":"-121.265247","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.135657,+-121.265247(24930)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24930) map </A>","Region":"California","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"24930","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Lodi","There were no other sightings in Lodi on or around July 30th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
