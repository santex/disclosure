I always look up into the sky to see the stars. I saw two lights, spaced evenly apart in the north; thought they were planes. The objects changed colors from red to yellow-orange at various times. Then I noticed a third object rising into the sky to the height of the other two. I looked at my watch. It was 10:45pm. They hovered for about 30 seconds and at first I thought they were planes. But the way the third object ascended was no plane. I was dumb-founded. I ran inside to get another person to come out and see the lights. When we both got out to the point I was previously, there was only one object remaining in the sky. There was no noise at any time when the objects were visible. Eventually the object disappeared traveling northwest. Could not believe what I had seen. Never saw three planes spaced so evenly apart, with no noise, traveling as these objects did."],"Date Submitted":"09/02/2012 09:59 UTC","Latitude":"40.657287","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"09/01/2012 10:45 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Northern Cambria","There were no other sightings in Northern Cambria on or around September 1st 2012"],"City":"Northern Cambria","Log Number":"US-09022012-0018","Longitude":"-78.785945","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42225.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42225.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"42225","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
