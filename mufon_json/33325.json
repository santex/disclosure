I told her it was a spaceship and she started crying at once realizing that it was still, and she said what does that mean for us. I was driving and told my little girl to keep her eye on the object until I could pull over within 10 sec. I look back after stopping and it was totally out of sight. Keep in mind we are in a wide open spot...I know that what we saw was nothing humans made...It had two white lights and two red...flashing randomly."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Conyers","There were no other sightings in Conyers on or around November 11th 2011"],"Latitude":"33.676995","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11132011-0003","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"33325","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33325.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33325.html"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/13/2011 05:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-83.946275","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"7 year old spotted","City":"Conyers"}
