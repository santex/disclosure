(remember only one light at a time was on and they were stationary.) next, another light appeared seemingly further away from the mountain, in a nw direction from where we had just seen the other lights, then off. then on again in a second, continuing on its nw path, then off, then appeared again about back where it started, then off. then, two more times moving in its nw direction, then off. after it disappeared this last time we did not see it again. unfortunately, since the event was only seconds long, by the time we got a camera out nobody had a chance to take a picture. we gazed into the mountains for several more minutes and never saw any aircraft or other objects that may have been reflecting light. this was my first ufo encounter and although i am not convinced it was e.t., i do classify this as an unidentified flying object."],"Summary":"Lights in the Sky, Arizona","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"11362","Region":"Arizona"}
