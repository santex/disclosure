I believe it was around 7am Phx time 6th 2005 sat. morning. I was watching what I think was a camera on Earth pointing at the dark side of some continent ,at night. You could see city lights, not moving of course because you can't see city lights move from that hight right? One light appeared moving on the screen from right to left then stopped , and change direction 60deg.NE. I am not sure if it stopped when the other light showed up on the right side of screen . Thelight moved accross a country in less than 7 sec. What moves that fast? And id it was not as close to earth as it looked it would still be way up. Oh the camera shut off at tht point and was not seen again in that direction."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"UFO on NASA channel aug 6th 2005","Latitude":"34.056128","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3719.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3719.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":[],"Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/06/2005 12:00 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-111.087211","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","City":"Undisclosed"}
