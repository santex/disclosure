(my dad lives across the road and he does have a motion sensor light out front but i can tell that light from what i seen) anyways, when i went to get a closer look... the light that i seen just went out. and that was it. i had the most unnerving feeling and i still do... because i know i went back to sleep and i woke up kater on that morning... but i dont remember when or how i went back to bed...also... it scares me because noone else seemed to hear these dogs barking... they all think im crazy :\\ i am not saying i was abducted or anything but i do find something really off about this event."],"Region":"New Brunswick","City":"Sussex","Date Submitted":"03/19/2013 12:47 UTC"}
