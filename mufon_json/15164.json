{"Date of the Event":"01/01/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was test driving a truck with my Wife in the begining of January at around 8pm when I saw a object heading at tremendous speed to my left when it disappeared. The object was very bright, large, and moving fast with no sound. I have been around many air shows when jets go supersonic and can tell from experience that this object was moving faster with no supersonic boom or any other sound to follow. It also disappeared out while traveling at this fast rate. I also want to make a note that this object was traveling horizontal to the earths surface. It did not have the slightest downward angle, when I saw it I wanted to assume it was a meteor coming into the earths atmosphere but with such a horizontal flight pattern I had to rule it out. It was also quite large. After the incident I asked my wife if she had seen it and she confirmed. I didn't want to believe in any of this until I saw the channel 6 report. Please post some answers.... Possible military classified airplane?"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in ???","There were no other sightings in ??? on or around January 1st 2009"],"Case Number":"15164","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Date Submitted":"01/01/2009 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15164.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15164.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01282009-0004","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.206222,+-77.187295(15164)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15164) map </A>","Longitude":"-77.187295","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Un real....","City":"???","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.206222"}
