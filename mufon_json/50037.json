I was driving southbound on US 31 outside of ludington MI, while looking at the blinking red lights on the top of the windmills off to the east I glanced across to the west and noticed 4 very distinguished lights suspended in the sky, they seemed to make an arch shape, and i thought it was just a star pattern in the night sky, at this time i was north of the objects, i kept an eye on it and realized the further i drove the more the objects formed a striaght line as i was completely east looking west of the objects, the furthest one in the distance dissappeared over the horizon of what i could see, the other three remained visible, just a solid redish orange white colored light being emitted by these objects, they just stayed in their spot, no strobe lights, no green or red ID lights, no movement, as i made my way further south i was trained on the stationary lights, about 4 minutes into the sighting i watched as the closest one to me started to move southwest and did a quick jump and shot away leaving the other two visible lights behind and i watched them til i drove out of sight, i filed a report to the police of ludington, they had an officer investigate it but i received no notice on the investigation, the woman on the phone said there was a water holding facility up there with lights similar to what i was explaining to her, but i assured her i knew that this was NOT the holding facility, as the holding facility was 3 miles north of where i was and the objects i seen were in the sky NOT the ground"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.957302,+-86.446823(50037)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50037) map </A>","Longitude":"-86.446823","City":"Ludington","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"50037","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Ludington","There were no other sightings in Ludington on or around August 17th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"08/21/2013 03:20 UTC","Region":"Michigan","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50037.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50037.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
