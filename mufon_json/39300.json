{"Region":"Colorado","divs":["Sighting DetailsSitting in my hammock and enjoying a beer (1) just after sunset. I noticed a bright white light appear on the western horizon and tracked it steadily east until it disappeared again over horizon. WAY too bright to be a satellite, stars were not yet visible. No flashing or blinking FAA lights, no sound. I went inside & grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look - to the naked eye object appeared to be a single white light, however when viewed through binoculars object was five lights arranged in a circular pattern."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"37.352586","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39300.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39300.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"39300","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-108.283929","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/09/2012 08:55 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.352586,+-108.283929(39300)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39300) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/12/2012 06:45 UTC","City":"Mancos","Summary":"Flyby","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Mancos","There were 4 other sightings in Mancos on or around June 9th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-06122012-0015"}
