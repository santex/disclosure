I turned to see it quickly fade to north star level of starlight, then quickly drop down and to the left of it's position. It stopped abruptly, then shot over to a place beneath it's original position. It began fading somewhat and was difficult to see until it re-appeared in its'original position.It then drifted slowly southward until it was further down than it had been on its' first drop, then faded out.
