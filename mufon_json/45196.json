There were several kids looking over in the same direction. He began shouting, now I see! there, theres a U>F>O>. Then I saw the orange globe like object just off to the east of us under cloud cover line. (though there were no clouds it was a clear night)We watched it slowley hover over a short distance then it simply vanished into thin air. Then off to the south over the beach I saw a large red cylinderical object appear lit in red. It was the oddest thing I have ever seen. It began to travel to the west in a swooping motion when it went behind a tree I lost vision of it."],"trends":["There have been 49 other sightings in Huntington Beach","There were no other sightings in Huntington Beach on or around January 12th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45196.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45196.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-118.011359","Date Submitted":"01/14/2013 12:01 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"01/12/2013 05:40 UTC","Summary":"2 objects 1 pulsating orange globe to east another bright red cylindrical off to south over beach.","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-01142013-0006","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.678623","Case Number":"45196","City":"Huntington Beach"}
