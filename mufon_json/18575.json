{"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas talking to a friend on the telephone & walked out in the back yard. I always like to take a look to see if I can see the moon before turning in. Finished call & saw the moon as big as its ever been but saw a lot more. A large bright white light in the southern sky - a light far brighter and bigger than any of the stars. It wasn't moving. Called a friend and drove to the Butler University campus where they have an Observatory. All was quiet on campus & Observatory appeared to be locked up tight. Object in sky could be seen even better through my binoculars. It was sitting in the same spot & never moved. Went back home & checked it every couple minutes for an hour until the mosquitoes got too bad & called it a night. Friend in Hamilton County who lives in country setting could see it far better without city lights. She said she had seen it last night also."],"Longitude":"-86.155234","Region":"Indiana","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There was one other sighting in Indianapolis on or around August 9th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/09/2009 11:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"39.774906","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"18575","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.774906,+-86.155234(18575)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18575) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08102009-0001","Date of the Event":"08/09/2009 11:10 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18575.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18575.html"],"City":"Indianapolis","Summary":"Huge bright white shape in southern sky","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
