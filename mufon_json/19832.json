I was driving along the highway scared to death but reassuring myself I would make it up there safe.As I was thinking this to myself to the right of my right side window I saw this flashing redish orange light appear .I thought it's probabley just an airplane or a weather balloon.I was barely getting close to anson texas but I could still see it as I drove through anson.As I passed through anson I headed out towards stamford there is just a stretch of highway of total seclusion before you get to stamford well as I drove out of anson I saw something happenning in the sky with that orange bright light I had been seeing.As I was driving to stamford from abilene.It started to move up then down then across then side ways fast......then it would sit real still in the air .I said to myself oh my god what is that ....It crossed slowely in front of my car but up high but where I could still see it ...then it came around to my left side of the car. I was still driving I was not stopping for anything or anyone I was that scared... I tried to call my brother but I couldn't get through to him ..My nephew at the time was on the phone talking to his girlfriend so he didn't switch over on the phone line to see who was calling .So I was all alone with ever was about to happen to me....I just kept remembering what my brother would say to me when things were occuring to me stay cool sister don't panic just let it occur see what it wants.....so I tried to stay calm but my heart was beating fast as it came closer and lower from the sky ...it looked orange and like a very bright star.But as it got closer I could see it was a space ship an unsual shaped space ship.It drifted to my left but low enough so that I could see it and slow enough so that I could observe the inside of it and it was not human.. it was an intity not from here ...it's energy was breathtaking that is how strong it felt being that close to my car.The energy level was so strong...it felt like if it were going to lift my car and take me off this highway it could easily have done it.But it didn't. It came close enough for me to feel it's presense and to see the ship that it was traveling in was like no other ...at close range .I felt like it was putting in my heart and mind.....a message {This is who we are tell somebody about this about what you are seeing.}......I could feel pressure in my body I was having trouble breathing but most of all I was afraid I would never be seen again .I started to pray within myself for it not to take me away from my grandaughter because she only had me in her life .I was the only one taking care of her...I started to cry for it not to take me. I was praying so hard I didn't even relize that I was almost close to stamford this incident happened inbetween anson and that small stretch inbetween on the highway that leads you in to stamford tx. It felt like I was out there for hours like time stopped during this time on the highway but as I turned to look again to my left side to see if it was still there it was traveling away from me towards abilene jumping in differnt directions appearing in one section of the sky and then reappearing in a another part of the sky then it dissappeared completly ...I couldn't see it anymore and I thanked god for what ever this was ...not taking me off the highway and away from my grandbaby."]}
