It was an exceptionally clear night and the lights on the airplane were very sharp and crisp. Then I noticed this boomerang shaped craft flying east to west. It was blurry looking, not nearly as crisp as the light of the airplane flying far above it. It had a series of red lights at the front and made no sound.It moved very smoothly. I was not upset, just surprised. It passed over the horizon and I lost sight of it. I have no way of judging how big it was. Several months ago I saw something quite similar, but much higher in the sky. It was moving north to south and I assumed it was a reflection off of a satellite or the ISS. Now I believe it was the same type of craft."],"Case Number":"22178","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.044476,+-76.302114(22178)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22178) map </A>","Longitude":"-76.302114","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22178.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22178.html"],"Summary":"Boomerang shaped ufo with red lights"}
