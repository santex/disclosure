It was a bright yellowish-white light hovering just over the trees towards the west, possibly standale area. It was very large and bright, brighter than any star or light that would be amitted from plane or helicopter. It would be bright then fade and then completly turn off. This light did this about 6 or 7 times, passing from semi-bright light to bright, to semi bright, to black. As it did this it would move slowly around the sky line. It moved in all directions. It first moved to the right, then up, then right again, very slowly. This is the second sighting of this light in two days. Yesterday A and V witnessed it to the east over Grand Rapids. Yesterday, the light flew towards the apartment, to the west, and then back the same way it came. It began very bright and dimmed. Moving very slowly. They report that a shnook helicopter was flying from north towards the south over the area of the freeways."]}
