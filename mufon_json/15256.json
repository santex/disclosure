It went towards Trenton. I'm outside quite frequently, being a smoker who smokes outside, i have become very familiar with the night sky. I have seen alot of unexplainable occurrences. This just adds to my list of many."],"Tags":"City","City":"Delano","Summary":"Saw what looked like a star going horizantal then just disappearing","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-76.090488","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
