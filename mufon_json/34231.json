My neibor and I were sitting on my deck. I heard an airplaine and I looked up and saw an airplane aproaching at a very high altitude. I don't know what type of airplane it was but it was up in or near the jet stream alttitude. As I was looking upwards this cilinder object flying along the same trjectory but much much lower whizzed by and I yelled at my neibor to look but when he did it had passed as Ihave a tree line close to my home. It was large , it had a cylinder shape and it made no noise whatsoever even though it was close .Had it not been for the plane I would not have looked up and noticed it at all."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
