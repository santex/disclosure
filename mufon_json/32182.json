Imagine if you will what a heart beat looks like on a monitor, that is the flight pattern that the object had. It was flying level, then shot up and then back down at least three times with a level flight path in between each change of altitude just like you would see on a heart beat monitor. Now being a child and not really knowing about flight characteristics of aircraft, satelites, meteors, etc I had no idea what I was looking at. But now, I definitely know that it was not any of those things. So what was it? As far as I know I have not seen anything since. But I have been interested in UFOs ever since."],"Latitude":"33.278169","Date Submitted":"09/29/2011 10:55 UTC","City":"Childersburg"}
