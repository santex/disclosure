I watched a jet airliner fly over on it's way to Cleveland. We are about 60 miles from Hopkins Airport so the jets are pretty high here. As the jet passed over head it flew past a UFO shaped like a \"Cheerio\". The jet flew unward toward Cleveland but the UFO remained motionless. It appeared that the jet flew under the UFO and the UFO was about the size of a wing. I went into the house to get my binoculars but when I got back the UFO was gone."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Ashland","There were no other sightings in Ashland on or around August 25th 2009"],"Latitude":"40.877523","Date of the Event":"08/25/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"31428","Summary":"I saw a doughnut shaped UFO floating overhead a couple years ago in the early fall.","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31428.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31428.html"],"Region":"Ohio","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.877523,+-82.31938(31428)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31428) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-82.31938","Date Submitted":"09/02/2011 12:00 UTC"}
