I Identify two objects up in the dark sky very close to mouth of the volcano one of them was more like a sphere but at the same time looked more like a open door in the sky,the other object was more like a disc shape, I thought it was coming out of the volcano along with the lava like almost being part of the lava, but those two ojects didn'tmove for about an hour and then disapeard in the dark night.I was skeptical at first, until I got home and started viewing my other pictureswhen I notice that more than a dozen of these flying objects were thereat the time of the eruption, that I couldn't see with the naked eye that night. Any aircraft that could fly that close to the mouth of the volcano without melting or blowing up in pieces? P.S Zoom in so you can apreciate better."],"Country":"Costa Rica","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7155.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7155_submitter_file1__volcanoCR.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7155.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/26/2006 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"CR-06042007-0012","Date Submitted":"04/26/2006 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=10.505224,+-84.872428(7155)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7155) map </A>","Region":""}
