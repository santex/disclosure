I was watching bats in my front yard when I heard a low hum. I looked west and saw a cube shaped object with 5 or 6 dim brownish bars of light that ran horizontaly along it. I remember estimating it's size to be about the same as an average house. It was flying about 150 to 200 yards above the ground, around 30 mpr. at the time (i was 16) I thought I was watching a satelite landing at the air force academy. At the time I didn't think twice about it being extraterrestrial. I always had thought how lucky I was to see something so cool, untill I got older and realized that satelites don't land."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/01/1992 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"16040","City":"Colorado Springs","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16040.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16040.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-104.819463","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Other","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Quiet cube humming north.","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-03152009-0019","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in Colorado Springs","There were no other sightings in Colorado Springs on or around July 1st 1992"],"Date Submitted":"07/01/1992 12:00 UTC"}
