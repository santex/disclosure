I've seen (and previously video taped) a sighting so I am now inclined to always look up. From the back of my car I saw a low flying orange ball or orb that was moving very fast over my culdesac. It made no noise and moved in a very smooth line from south to north. After it was over my home it either disappeard into night clouds or vanished all together. I tried to record on my cell phone, but it wouldn't pick anything up. There were planes flying well over the orange ball, so it was clear to me that this wasn't a plane. Someone also reported seeing the same thing in Bellview Illinois a couple of hours later (on another site). Very weird."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-88.130463","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26230.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26230.html"],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Carol Stream","There were no other sightings in Carol Stream on or around October 29th 2010"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-10302010-0018","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/30/2010 06:54 UTC","Latitude":"41.922329","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.922329,+-88.130463(26230)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26230) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
