Then I just looked up, for no reason, and I see a flying object that I couldnt Identfy. It had a sphere on the top of it, and a upside down cone conected to the bottom it, the bottom of the cone wobbled in a spinning motion. The whole 10 seconds I watched it, the wobble was slow, and then rapidly wobbled fast, as it zipped up in to the sky, out of sight. I looked to see if anyone else saw that, and mostly everyone was on the bus already, and nobody said anything about it. Now that I think about it, I wonder if it left because we left on to the bus, or if it wasnt paying attention, when I saw it, and then saw me looking at it. That was the first and only time I have seen a Flying Object, that I couldnt Identfy. I wish I could see it again."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-12142010-0017"}
