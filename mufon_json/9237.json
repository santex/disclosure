As we gathered Im assuming trying to decide what to do with ourselves, and were conversing... I was in mid sentance when I began to notice what I can only describe as an oscillating drone a sort of low humming similar to high voltage power lines. I continued talking but was scaning around in the direction this odd noise was comming from as I did so I seen a miniscule blip of pulsating white light moving at what I know now as a very high rate of speed... my right arm shot out at it and I pointed right at it and exclaimed I SEE YOU! I recall in my peripherial my friends look of horror as they moved behind me I was fixated and did not take my eyes from it. It was like it seen and heard me also...There was a very sharp Crack I would not compare this to a sonic boom at all...followed by the most beautiful sound I have ever heard I can only try to explain as the sound of crystals smashing and a modulated sound similar to a trumpet blast which to me was like the feeling of Glory (hard to explain) this had moved the tiny blip in an instant to what was now a massive Glass Object mostly looking like a mirror all over the surface but with multitudes of color shimmering throughout it, sort of a diamond shape but was also like natural crystaline structure no light sources on it at all, I recall thinking the top section looked like a magnificent city of glass sky scrapers, Behind me I heard the chaos of my friends one of them shouting look at that witch on that shed! followed by numerous swear words 8) they were after it! I knew this but still I was fixated and by now this thing was in my mind speaking to me... I recall how the sky had changed the clouds seemed to be moving throughout the sky at an extremly excellerated rate but everything else seemed so slow and calm there was no wind that day the clouds before were not really moving and although there was no wind the wheat field still miles bellow this Magnificent object was gently swaying back and forth like small waves on the water... I wish, I really want to remeber all this thing was telling me but I recall only a few things I remember thinking it was God but this was almost a shock to them they assured me they were not the creator as I sensed it was many now but one of mind if that makes any sense to whoever is reading this. I remember asking how they flew so different from planes I recall them saying we use everything and anything with electro magnetic pulse propulsion this particular craft was made from the sands of the moon.When I say they used anything and everything that means the fuel they used was whatever substance they were in. The craft it self needed no fuel inside it. ��� also remeber almost bieng scolded by them and warned of something that I had to change or do something by a certain time or it would be to late. I need to know what this is. I also assumed at that time everyone in my city if not the whole world was going to know about what I was looking at.Unfortunately this was not the case... I believe I have a wealth of information from them that needs to be unlocked... My strange story is not finished I recall bieng in a white room with only a chair which I was in looking at pictures that I know now would be called holograms which were suspended before me.. some where like blueprints infact thier background was a deep blue the drawings where bright white of structures all I can recall of them though. I was not in the presence of what ppl call greys I was alone in this room but they were still in my mind...I do remember looking at a fantastic 3 dimensional image complete with the sounds and smells of 2 animals not from this earth I said animals they were alien but it is my feeling these were animals and nothing more. But for some reason I also felt like they are animals we have here now but this is what they will one day become... Oh yes In this room there was only one thing besides the chair on the wall in front of me a light blue glowing symbol with 3 golden stars in a diagonal line. The symbol was like a letter from some ancient scripts I have since seen... Im going to stop at that for the room... The length of the field I was in spans a half mile easy on the other side of the rode was a massive dirt hill from what was then a new sub division under development which we had made into a dirt track for our bmx bikes... Anyway when this all started I was at the midway point of this field with my bike on the ground close by. I found myself awakening from laying on my back with a slight headache a fuzzy feeling in my mouth and bieng rather disoriented and groogy as I stood up and gathered myself I saw my bike on the other side of the road which I was now very close to I had moved a distance of a quarter of a mile say with no memory of moving, My hutch (BMX) was laying on the oppisite side of the rode now half way up the closet jump to me... This may sound contradictory but I have been piecing this together for quite some time now as I am now 37 years old after I got my bike which really took quite some time and quite an effort due to the way I felt my bike was aprox 70 yards away from me...Anyway I did have full recollection of everything I have told you except the white room..which came to me days later... However my friends were nowhere near me by this time I had to find them to talk about what we all had just seen... I know they saw it too,But when I found them playing football in the park they had no idea what I was talking about... When I asked my closet friend of this group what about the Witch you guys went after he smiled at me and laughed his nervious high pitched laugh I remeber him looking rather pale all I could get from him is she just sat upon the roof staring at us... that was all he said and would never say more nevr to this day... I have no idea what they saw as I dont remember taking my eyes off the object till the time I awoke when I woke up I didnt see the thing leaving or anything like that at all bieng a kid not wearing a watch or even caring about time have no idea how much had passed but I do know the sun had moved a great deal I would guess atleast 2 hours time had past...Anyway this is the first time I have ever tried to explain this experience in written form I have talked to friends about it only close ones and I can tell they think Im lying or perhaps even crazy...I assure you I am not so... Nor would I wish to waste your time or the time it has taking me to write this or the countless hours I have spent pondering this over the years... MOst do not Believe in UFOS some believe I know and truth is most certainly stranger then fiction. your brother in Christ our Lord."],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Unlike any other described UFO I have ever read about and have been very intrested since","City":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.940731,+-116.570964(9237)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9237) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
