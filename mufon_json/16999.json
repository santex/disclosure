The photo was taken looking North West over the city. When I observed the photo I thought I might have moved the camera but realized the streak is the object moving at high speed. I had the Nikon S630 rested on top of the car so as to avoid any camera shake. The object is perfectly round some miles from me but I don't know how far away. Just for reference, the moon was in the southern sky and only a small slice."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-105.263476","Country":"United States","Case Number":"16999","Date of the Event":"05/19/2009 05:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"Taking Photos of Early Morning Sky Found a Round Object in Photo","Date Submitted":"05/19/2009 05:35 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Boulder","There were no other sightings in Boulder on or around May 19th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
