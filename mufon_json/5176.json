IT WAS PAST SUNSET. I NOTICED A CIGAR-SHAPED YELLOW ORANGE LIGHT VERY LOW ON THE HORIZON. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERESTING TRICK OF THE MOON AND CLOUDS, BUT THEN I NOTICED ANOTHER DIRECTLY TO ITS RIGHT - IDENTICAL IN SIZE AND SHAPE, BUT A BIT DIMMER. WOW, I THOUGHT, THAT IS INDEED AN INTERESTING TRICK OF MOON AND CLOUDS, AS THE SPACE THE LIGHTS SPANNED WAS MUCH WIDER THAN THE MOON APPEARS. STILL THINKING IT WAS AN OPTICAL ILLUSION, I CONTINUED TO WHERE MY VISION OF THE LIGHTS WAS BLOCKED BY FOLIAGE. I WENT TO LOOK FOR THE \"MOON\" PHENOMENON LATER AND COULD NOT FIND IT. TODAY (AUGUST 2) I REALIZED THAT THE MOON SHOULD NOT BE SO LOW ON THE HORIZON DIRECTLY NORTH, UNLESS ONE IS IN ANTARCTICA."],"Longitude":"-85.350805","Date Submitted":"07/30/2006 10:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"5176","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","Object Shape":"Cigar","Log Number":"US-08022006-0001","Country":"United States","City":"Eaton","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Eaton","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
