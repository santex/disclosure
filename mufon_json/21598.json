I opened my eyes and saw a round black object coming towards me . This was just in front of my night table- about 4ft. off the ground.It's overall size was about 12\" to 16\" - I could tell it was in motion-steadily.Not rotating just moving forward. I had no problem seeing it because i keep a Lamp on in our Bathroom that has a 40watt bulb glowing -so low light, but i could still see well. It was coming at me at a slightly angled direction. When i saw it -i gasped and sat up.It vanished when i sat up. I am an Abductee,aware since 2004 - but have NEVER seen anything like this before. Drawing is attached.
