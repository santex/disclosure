At first it looked like it was a green flare but it was not a \"fiery\" kind of light this was a steady bright light all the way to the point when it vanished. My reaction was more along the lines of \"WOW what the hell is that?!\". Again this was very fast and only lasted about 3-4 sec."],"Latitude":"33.883794","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Corona","There were no other sightings in Corona on or around August 1st 2005"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.883794,+-117.561658(3663)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3663) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
