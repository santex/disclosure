{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI actually had several experiences. At any given nite I could sit out and spot them. My brother sister in law and daughter also witnessed these. One flew rite over me and my daughter ran inside. 6mos later I moved bak to stlouis and had a hysterectomy. My doc seemed to b guessing at what was on my ovary when he removed it. Im not sure about that part. He just looked funnx at me when talking about it. It was an experience that made me a believer. I was surprised that most people there saw things and it was no big deal. Like in a movie r something. What I noticed was they appear to be stars but its the reflection to their metallic look that causes this. They hoover at tree level too. Pilot knob is where I first saw them. One spiralled 2wards the lake. They seem attracted to bodies of water. That nite they were attracted to the mud island we were standing on and coleman lantern we had lit. This is wat I felt that nite. I hid in my brothers truck. That wasnt all that summer either."],"Longitude":"-90.622624","Date of the Event":"04/15/2000 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Iron Mountain Lake","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Disc, Star-like","Summary":"surrounded us while night fishing hiding at tree level","City":"Iron Mountain Lake","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28872.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28872.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"37.693106","Case Number":"28872","Date Submitted":"04/30/2011 01:11 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.693106,+-90.622624(28872)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28872) map </A>","Log Number":"US-04302011-0009","Region":"Missouri"}
