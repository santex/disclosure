No flashing lights, no color other than bright white, steady light and no noise. (Helicopters located at the airport less than 3 miles away are noisy and we are use to that sound. Commercial liners fly higher in the east west fly way along I-80, make noise and you can see strobes of the red and white colors.) Lights maintained same speed and brightness for at least 5 minutes before fading out. A friend living east of town was called and observed the same lights until they slowly faded away. Not airplanes. Calls to the airport tower in Grand Island were not answered. This was not two meteorites or any satellites. Have seen plenty of those out here in the country. Hoping someone saw the same ones !"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-98.337052","City":"Grand Island","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.935166,+-98.337052(19151)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19151) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/08/2009 08:25 UTC","Region":"Nebraska"}
