{"Summary":"White tripod shaped lights in the sky. Stayed solid, but craft would move very slowly, stop and hover, and then change directions. At one time there were 3 of them. One larger than the others in which the smaller ones would go in and out from.","divs":["Sighting DetailsOut with my daughter walking our dogs. The night was cloudy and when the clouds moved out of the way we saw this very bright white light. At first we thought it was a star, but then it started to move. It would hover or pause, and then change directions. Moved very slowly. Once in a while another one would appear and stay near the larger craft, then move around and disappear - I think into the larger ship. We watched for about 10 minutes. When we stopped, the larger ship and one smaller one were still visible. There was no sound."],"Case Number":"36687","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Columbia","There were no other sightings in Columbia on or around March 22nd 2012"],"Longitude":"-92.353766","Date of the Event":"03/22/2012 08:00 UTC","Latitude":"38.913139","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.913139,+-92.353766(36687)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36687) map </A>","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/23/2012 02:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36687.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36687.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03232012-0017","Region":"Missouri","City":"Columbia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
