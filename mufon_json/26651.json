(think of holding a flashlight at a 45 degree angle pointing up) at this point i noticed that i was correct that it was missing the clearance lights (or whatever those flashing ligthts are called) and i wanted to adjust my binoculars a bit so i took them down. after fixing them i spotted it again. it hadn't moved very far at all and was about the same size in the sky as previously. probably took about ten-fifteen seconds to adjust lenses. but when i tried to find it in my binoculars i couldn't. once again i lowered them, and found it with my eyes, tried to put the binoculars back on it and couldn't. i looked through them for about 10 seconds and when i took them down again the object was gone. it wasn't that it had traveled so far that it became too small to see. it had simply dissappeared. i felt really excited about it and at this point i went inside and told my wife what i had just saw."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Red Oak","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.950932","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City","Region":"Oklahoma","Summary":"Bluish glowing object sighted in Northern sky.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26651.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26651.html"]}
