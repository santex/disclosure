It was a light right above the tree tops that was blinking white than red. We thought it was a star at first, but we kept watching it and s when we saw it moving. It was far away, but wecould see it moving slowly. It moved in a straight line, stop, than rise. It did that several times, than it became motionless. We watched it for a while, maybe an hour. We tried to take pics and video, but I guess it was to far away because nothing showed up. This was at night. Eventually we left because it was getting late. When we got home, my brother called and said that shot straight up and lined up with other stars. We went back te following night but we saw nothing. There was no star where we first saw it."],"Latitude":"39.515048","Longitude":"-86.394994","Case Number":"32822","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Other","Summary":"White then red blinking light","Date of the Event":"10/21/2011 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Centerton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.515048,+-86.394994(32822)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32822) map </A>"}
