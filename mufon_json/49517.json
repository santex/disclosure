Tudor lane to be exact. Looked at the sky and saw a bright white star like object in the night sky, moving slowly in a straight line. Thought it might be a plane, but i did not witness any lights planes normally have.Stayed consistently bright white. I was very shocked and confused, not sure what it could be. I know it was no plane. At least none that i have seen looked like that. I was on foot and lost sight of the object. Was hoping someone else saw it as well."],"Object Shape":"Diamond, Sphere","Longitude":"-78.668283","Date of the Event":"08/05/2013 09:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","City":"Lockport","Region":"New York","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/05/2013 11:09 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49517.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49517.html"],"Latitude":"43.170038","Summary":"Bright white star like object in the night sky, moving slowly in a straight line.","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"49517"}
