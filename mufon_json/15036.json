As I was driving I looked out the driver side window to see a glowing blue cigar shaped object floating in the sky. As I looked on the object descended rapidly towards the ground and then ascended rapidly and leveled out. This movement reminded me of roller coaster. As the object descended its color started changing to white and as it leveled out the object was completely white. Once the object was leveled it remained in the sky for a second and then flew off at a great speed and disappeared. The object appeared to stretch as it flew off. When I had first spotted the object, I thought it was a shooting star until it started to descend. After witnessing this, I asked my girlfriend if she had just seen the object and she said no that she had been looking out the other window."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.235317","Summary":"Glowing blue cigar shaped object dived in air and ascended quickly.
