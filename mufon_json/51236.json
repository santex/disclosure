Objects were very bright redish orange with distinctive formation. Witnessed from road side. at least 6 craft formed a large equilateral triangle shape formation before mingling with one another. I was very excited. They moved slowly. They then descended in a loose formation below the tree line which was less than a mile away from me and a fellow witness. after a couple minutes 3 of the craft arose back into view just above the tree line. One of the craft then headed west across the horizon and a moderate speed while the other two remained hovering then faded out. After a few more minutes two more arose from the same spot in the tree line. They hovered for 30 seconds or so then faded out of sight."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-78.902002","Case Number":"51236","Summary":"Witnessed from road side. at least 6 craft formed a large triangle shape formation before mingling with one another.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51236.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51236.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10012013-0010","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Sanborn","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Sanborn","There were no other sightings in Sanborn on or around September 28th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.14747,+-78.902002(51236)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51236) map </A>"}
