( if this plane didn't see it , i would be very surprised )at first , i thought they may have been skydivers and waited for their parachutes to open ... they didn't. then i thought they could be gliders , but they were clearly too high and gliders can't hover.after i eliminated the only 2 possibilities ..i then saw one of them move to the north of the first one ( i'm guessing a couple of miles away , then it stopped , paused for about 10 seconds and flew back to the first one .. they were both stationary for at least a minute then the second one seemed to dissolve . the first one started to head towards the 3 of us and was heading east towards montreal.the whole event lasted at least 10 minutes . i was excited to witness this event.i believe it was my 3rd sighting since i was about 9 years old ( approx. 36 years ) i know it sounds weird but i believe its 3 times now.only 1 of my coworkers saw what orb \\ sphere in the distance . the 3rd one us just couldn't see what we saw. we lost sight of the object in the distance no sound \\ no vapour trail & it flew \\ hovered at about the same altitude as a commercial airliner and seemed to travel about 3 times their speed . this happened about 4 - 5 miles from the ottawa airport"],"Latitude":"45.42259","Summary":"Orb or Sphere Like","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-75.687593","Case Number":"49186","City":"Ottawa","Date Submitted":"07/25/2013 08:50 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/25/2013 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
