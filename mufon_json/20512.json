As we stopped, I looked out of my window I saw a triangle-shaped object at about 500 feet away. It was probably about 200 feet from end to end. The lights were a redish color and were located at each end of the triangle. At first I thought it was an airplane but it stood still and didn't flash it's red and blue lights. I saw this object for about 2 minutes until my mother turned at the light and I lost sight of it behind some trees. When I returned home, I had a slight headache and stomach ache for the rest of the day. I believe I was the only witness in the area to the event."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.203498,+-80.243816(20512)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20512) map </A>","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20512.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20512.html"],"Log Number":"US-11142009-0012","Longitude":"-80.243816","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"Motionless and bright.","Country":"United States","City":"Stuart","Object Features":"Patterned Surface"}
