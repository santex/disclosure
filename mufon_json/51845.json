It was still daylight out. I saw a silver cylinder cross my path through my windshield. It was travel ing south, right above the tree-line. There were no windows or markings on it. I would estimate the speed at 30 mph. The size would be between 40 to 50 feet. It had no right to be there, if I had the family shotgun, I could have nailed it. They are suppose to be in somebody elses neighborhood or on TV. Im going out and buy a shotgun or rifle right now. I know it was a probe.
