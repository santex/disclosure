I have a view of the ocean. At about 8:20 I saw a bright white light over the bay. I was talking to a friend on the phone and joked that I was looking at a UFO. I reached down to pet my dog and in a matter of seconds, there was nothing in the sky. I did not see it fly away it was just not there anymore. I thought it was kind of strange and then today my friend sent me a link showing that other people in this same area had seen things like this in past month also. It did not look like a plane because it was not moving."],"Case Number":"41899","Summary":"Bright Object in Sky Looked like a Head light in the sky","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"08/20/2012 05:20 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/19/2012 08:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.917173,+-122.81604(41899)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41899) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"48.917173","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Birch Bay","There were no other sightings in Birch Bay on or around August 19th 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.81604","Source":"MUFON"}
