I looked up and saw the disc moving slowly in a south east direction. It wasn't hovering directly above me (it was south east from me) - I'm guessing it was probably a mile out from where I was standing, though I can't be exact about that, obviously. I watched it for about 1 minute before it was obscured by some trees. It was moving slowly, though I can't say for sure how slow. Slower than the normal speed of an airplane, that's for sure. I always keep my eye out for this type of thing, and there are always a ton of airplanes around since LAX is a major airport around here, but this was definitely not a plane. I could tell it was disc shaped because it was dotted with lights all around, and each light would go out one by one to be replaced with a light next to it. In other words, it was like a blank space was traveling around the lighted circumference of the object, if that makes any sense."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25552.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25552.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/25/2010 02:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-118.237705","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25552","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"34.054774"}
