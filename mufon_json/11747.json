I was waiting outside my apartment complex for my ride when I looked up towards the sky to the north of my location. I saw something hovering there for almost the whol;e time I was out there. I am not sure how long I was out there but between the time I went out & saw it & the time my ride got there it just sat there. It looked almost like a hot air balloon but it just hovered there. At one point, on the way to church after my ride got me, I still saw it in the sky but it had moved. It didn't act like a hot air ballon. It was like a dark blue object against the clear blue sky with the sunshit bright in the sky to my right. It didn't act like a hot air ballon. I have seen those on tv. I would be like getting in the car & talkingto my ride & then glancing up to see it every so often. It was weird."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.774396","Country":"United States","City":"Indianapolis","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/06/2008 08:25 UTC","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There were 2 other sightings in Indianapolis on or around July 6th 2008"],"Case Number":"11747","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11747.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11747.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.148374","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-07262008-0005"}
