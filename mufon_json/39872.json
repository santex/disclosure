{"Region":"Virginia","divs":["sighting detailsi was riding my bicycle towards potomac yards from crystal city. which is weird after i thought about it because i wasn't going to even head over there. i planned on going back to my apartment, but something urged me to just go that way so i said what the hell i'll go real quick. as i was 3\\4 the way there i was on a small overpass bridge and that's when i looked up and saw the usual planes in final. but this time i saw a metallic disc above the planes usual flight path and it just moved in several directions as to grasp my attention. well it did and then it appeared to move away from me and suddenly it was gone. i don't know if it just zipped away or just disenegrated. i was excited to have seen something that i actually can't explain. i fly a lot and see a lot of traffic in the sky and this wasnt a plane or any other aircraft we know about."],"Latitude":"38.851403","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39872.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39872.html"],"Case Number":"39872","Longitude":"-77.050689","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Metallic disc less then 10 miles from DC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Disc","City":"Arlington","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.851403,+-77.050689(39872)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39872) map </A>","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Arlington","There were no other sightings in Arlington on or around June 27th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"06/27/2012 12:48 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-06272012-0017","Date Submitted":"06/27/2012 01:32 UTC"}
