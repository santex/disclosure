Last night we returned about 2 hours earlier . I was using the bonoculars and had just passed them to my wife when as she put them to her eyes I noticed a bright light which grew larger quickly I asked her fo the bonoculars back and as she passed them to me she also saw the light, I focused on the light and as I was looking it turned at an angle and I could see the whole side of it. The sun was to the south west just going behind the hills in the distance. When I first saw the side of the object it looked alot like a torpedo in shape , I'm guessing about 75ft in length and I would estimate 10-15miles i'm not real good with distance. But I do know what we saw.In the time that I gave the bonoculars to my wife it went up at an angle into the cloud above. When she looked at the object all she saw was a black dot. It all lasted less than 5 seconds."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.097896,+-64.744414(25835)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25835) map </A>","Latitude":"46.097896","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25835.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25835.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/12/2010 09:47 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25835","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
