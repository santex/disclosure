{"Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn July 25, 2010 I was sky watching and at approximately 8:00pm a low in the sky, bright looking star moved out of the north towards the west and stop directly over the house. It stayed in that position for almost an hour till it faded away. Last night July 26, it was not there. I know that stars for one don't move fast through the sky like a plane and then stop. I also know that if it was a star or planet, it would show up the following night. when I looked at the \"star\" through my binoculars it looked white with a blue halo around it. This location was outside of Ligonier, PA I never lost sight of the object, i have neck pain to prove that. It simply faded away before my eyes into the blue sky."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Ligonier","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24788.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24788.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.243128","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.243128,+-79.237532(24788)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24788) map </A>","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Ligonier","There were no other sightings in Ligonier on or around July 25th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Date of the Event":"07/25/2010 08:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"Star like, but moving, then stopping for maybe 50 minutes.","Log Number":"US-07272010-0012","Longitude":"-79.237532","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/27/2010 01:31 UTC","Case Number":"24788"}
