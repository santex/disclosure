Will vanish in a second after getting much brighter. Reappears miles away and mimics the same behavior. Almost nightly appearances. There was one night that an Orb had given birth to another and absorbed the 2nd back in, I have only witnessed this occurance once with my son. There are 11 cellphone towers visable from my back door (and I have terrible reception) I am on a slight hill and have great view of everything around me. I have tried to view these objects thru a telescope and binoculers or take a piture and for some reason they are not visable thru these devices. I have nothing but frustration for these things...but total fascination at the same time."],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"02/20/2013 11:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45802.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45802.html"],"Latitude":"35.998538","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"North Carolina","Date of the Event":"01/29/2013 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.998538,+-80.703291(45802)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45802) map </A>","City":"Harmony","Case Number":"45802","Summary":"Brightly glowing orbs in sky around cellphone tower..will appear and are large in comparison to tower from my home.
