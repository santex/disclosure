{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside for a smoke and I looked up in the sky looking south and I noticed a flash in the sky, I looked more closely at the object and it was shaped like a triangle. The back of it looked like it was on fire and it streaked down towards Lake Superior going west really fast and then I lost sight of it because of the trees. It was going to go right into Lake Superior if it kept it course that I saw it was on. Then about two minutes after I lost sight of it, two F18's were out circling around where I last seen the object. Then three more planes showed up about five minutes after I had last seen the object. The five planes then just circled around like they were looking for something. The five planes flew around for about 20 minutes then a larger plane like a 30 passenger jet flew over the top of them going east and the five F18's followed the larger jet and left the area. I waited for about 25 minutes and kept looking over the lake, but I didn't see anything."],"Date Submitted":"01/10/2008 09:30 UTC","Case Number":"8827","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Minnesota","City":"Two Harbors","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-01112008-0008","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Two Harbors","There were no other sightings in Two Harbors on or around January 10th 2008"],"Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8827.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8827.html"],"Longitude":"-91.668382","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.030041,+-91.668382(8827)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8827) map </A>","Date of the Event":"01/10/2008 09:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"I saw a flash in the sky, then a triangle shaped ship streaked accross the sky over the western part of Lake Superior.","Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"47.030041","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
