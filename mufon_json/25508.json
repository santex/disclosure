She was distracted by a strange light in the sky coming from the north going south. It appeard to be a red light with a trail of light which give it the effect of a rocket. It wasnt moving fast from our ponit but with the light trail it had that effect. Then the trail of light vanished and all you can see was a red light in the sky. We took a good look at it to see if it was a plane. I wasnt able to see any blinking strobe lights on the object. It was just a red light. I was still heading south bound when we notice what appear to be a white glow of a light that covered the front of the light about 180 degrees. We figured it was just a plan with the head lights but the light then was completely around the red ball. Then the red ball vanished in the blink of a eye."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"25508","Disposition":"IFO"}
