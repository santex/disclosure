I had come home around 11:30 ish and was watching t.v. in my bedroom. My t.v. in my bedroom sits on my dresser, behind the dresser is two skylights, one directly behind my television.Between 2:20 & 2:30 or so I saw a bright, round glowing object fly at an incredible speed past my skylight in a downward trajectory towards the water across the street from my house. It was going (I think, not too good with directions)but from my vantage point,south to north. I live on a cove and it was headed straight that way.By the time I got up and went to the window it had disappeared. I know it wasn't a shooting star (seen a few of those before) but maybe a comet? or an asteroid? Don't know therefore it is unidentified. It \"caught\" my eye because it was so bright in the night sky and FAST!!My feeling and emotions were stunned amazement and excitemant with a Large dose of curiosity."],"Object Features":"None","Latitude":"42.52321","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-70.891646","Date of the Event":"03/20/2008 02:26 UTC","Case Number":"10040","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10040.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10040.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10040.html"],"City":"Salem","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/20/2008 02:26 UTC","Log Number":"US-03252008-0005","Summary":"Bright,white ball shaped object."}
