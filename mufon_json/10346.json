We knew it wasn't a helecopter because it didn't have flashing lights. We stayed at the sight for about 5 minutes then went home. When we drove off, we looked in the rear view mirrior and it was still there. It had red lights on the side, blue light on the back and a big huge yellow light on the bottom. It was about as bright as a yellow high-lighter. We wern't sure of what it could be. When we first saw it, we thought it was a UFO because airplanes don't have yellow lights on the bottom. We got out of the car, and it was silence, so it wasn't a helecopter for sure. The object is still there, not making a sound. We felt like something was visting us from anther world. The time of this happend at 8:27 pm on April 12,2008. Also in Dallas,Oregon. The \"UFO\" sighting was right by Ellendale rd. Then we decied to go home, and thats how we lost sight of it."],"Date of the Event":"04/12/2008 08:27 UTC","City":"Dallas"}
