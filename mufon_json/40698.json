{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"40698","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting Details We were waiting to see if the clouds would clear so we could see eclipse. When they appeared we surely were not expecting it. I did not know what to think they were, it surprized me and kinda freaked me out a little. The orbs just appeared from nothing to a brillant light perfect in shape and were of the same size... the left one was lower on the horizon vs. the right. After a few seconds of being stationary they started to slowly move together until they joined and disappeared... Was very angelic looking against the pink sky... Cant explain what we saw and my wife said to me \"oh my god what is that!!\"... we werent afraid , they seemed to be very far off. I would say they were the size of pencil eraser on the horizon.."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40698.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40698.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07112012-0009","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"05/20/2012 12:00 UTC","City":"Colleyville","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Colleyville","There were no other sightings in Colleyville on or around May 20th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.905417,+-97.183687(40698)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40698) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-97.183687","Latitude":"32.905417","Summary":"clouds covering eclipse, then the 2 orbs appeared in the distance Horizon","Date Submitted":"07/11/2012 08:58 UTC"}
