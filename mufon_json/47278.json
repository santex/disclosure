Then the object that was moving west to east turned and joined the others north south path. I then noticed another star like object moving south to north which I watched until it was out of sight. About two minutes after that I observed two star like objects moving west to east roughly a mile apart from each other and closing the gap quickly until they were almost parallel with each other and I watched them until they were out of sight. I This is not the first night I have observed these star like objects. Some night there might be one or two and some nights none. But tonight they were in unison with one another and moved in tandem. I have always been very interested in UFO's and extraterestial crafts. I was so excited to think that I had actually witnessed a ufo experience of my own even though at a long distance away. I've been told that these star like objects in the night sky might just be satellites but I believe tonights observations were intellegent crafts with the way they moved together.
