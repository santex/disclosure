However it came back a few second later and appeared to start circling the lake, some times it seemed to hover behind trees. After a few minutes there were three or four more that appeared and flew over the lake in about five seconds. The lake is a mile long and half a mile wide. They were darting all over the sky. When seen flying over the lake they seemed star like, when hovering over the trees they seemed much smaller, like small orbs. They were not planes, meteors, or fireworks. They made no noise. After about half an hour they disappeared. It was wonderful and mind boggling."],"Region":"New York","Latitude":"42.827014","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown"}
