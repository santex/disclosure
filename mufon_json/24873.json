{"Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"Disc shaped object.","Date of the Event":"07/31/2010 02:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","divs":["Sighting DetailsDuring the time of this observation I was driving to the nearest Wal-mart in Lake Jackson and on my way there I noticed this object in the sky immediately to the north and the only way I could observe is with my sunglasses on. At first I thought it was an airplane since we have a local airport in the area and on occasion we have aircraft do approaches some as big as 737's. At first I thought it was an aircraft but like I said I could only see it with my sun glasses on. The weather conditions were as followed. Clear skies with a temp of 96 degrees and a heat index of 102-106. the object appeared to be on a northern track heading towards Houston. My reaction at first was wow here we go again. I have 11 years of military experience as an Operation Specialist in the U.S. Navy. Part of my training was identifying aircraft and this to me was no aircraft. The object remained stationary for a couple of minutes but like I said it appeared to be on a northerly track."],"Log Number":"US-08012010-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.033858,+-95.434386(24873)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24873) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lake Jackson","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24873.html"],"Case Number":"24873","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-95.434386","Date Submitted":"08/01/2010 02:34 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"29.033858","City":"Lake Jackson"}
