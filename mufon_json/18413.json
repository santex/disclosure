{"Log Number":"US-07312009-0008","Object Shape":"Circle","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/27/2009 07:00 UTC","Region":"Utah","divs":["sighting detailsi am a member of il. mufon and an investigator, both for mufon and the state of il. i purchased a bike in reno on monday 7\\27\\09, and was driving it back to st. louis on i-80, on monday night. i had just crossed over the utah border and saw the bonneville salt flats exit sign on i-80. the wind was blowing about 30 knots, which caused my bike to lean as i drove at about 80 miles per hour. it was dark, very few if any clouds, dry and the conditions were nominal except for the tremendous wind from the north blowing southward. i was also wearing a helmet, full face. i was looking up at all the stars and the blinking lights of many planes traversing the sky as i drove in the darkness. a white light then appeared to my right (south) at very high altitude at about my 40 degree position. i estimate the altitude and distance to be 15,000 feet at 10 to 15 miles out. when it shown its light, it appeared to be a plan with running lights, breaking through the clouds--in other words, it had a halo effect. i dismissed this as a plane, even though there were very few clouds directly above me; however, at that distance, there could have been more clouds. as i drove, the ultra bright white light descended and was moving fast towards me. about 2 minutes later, the light appeared again, altitude, much lower and much closer than before, maybe 8 to 10 miles. this kept happening about every 2 to 3 minutes, the light would power up, shine in my direction, then slowly turn off, as if were a river barge light. it didn't just switch off, it quickly phased down. i kept looking back thinking that the light should eventually cross the road behind me since it was on a 90 degree angle to me and heading in my direction. at some point, i should have traveled east of it's trajectory to the north since we were on a perpendicular course. but that never happened. the light lit up about 6 to 7 times, each time, closer, brighter, lower and especially disturbing, always in the same 40 degree position as when i first viewed it. logically, that meant that the light was keeping pace with me, which was very disturbing to me, but i was never afraid, just extremely compelled to continue to look on that same heading of south, south-east. i couldn't decide which was more interesting, the fact that it was getting closer to me, or the fact that it was always in the same position to me. after about 6 events of the light turning on and then off, duration each time being about 3 to 5 seconds, it then was at it's closest point to me, about 1 mile. what happened next was absolutely fascinating and the even then caused me to dismiss my assumption of an airplane or helicopter and\\or the characteristics of a man made craft that i had ever seen before. the second to the last time of this close encounter the light shown at me, very close, one mile and this time it continued to stay on. one to two seconds later, two other lights to its left came on along with it, same luminosity, same distance, moving with me but not horizontally symmetrical to each other. they were all three equidistant to each other, but the middle one was at a higher elevation than the other two making it appear to me as a very flat pyramidal grouping of three white, brilliant, lights about 1 mile away from me. there was never any beam of any sort and i looked to see if the white salt below became illuminated because of the lights. it did not. just brilliant white lights off to my 40 to 45 degrees each time. at the closest point to me, i estimate the altitude to now be about 600 to 1,000 feet at a distance of no more than 1 mile from me, if even that. the three lights then all turned off at the same time, vaporising down, like a river barge's lights. i now figured that these lights were directly pointing at me, why i don't know. i felt that this was now a personal experience i was having and not just random lights. there was too much evidence of this for me to dismiss it now. i always saw stars in the background as if these lights were not a part of any craft or solid object. they appeared independent of each other but uniformly symmetrical in their formation, except for the slightly flattened pyramidal characteristic described above. the last time it shown on me was amazing! that same single light appeared one last time, same heading to me, same distance and same altitude as before. from a distance of about half a mile away i saw what looked like lcd, brilliant orangish\\reddish, lights scrolling from way behind the light, to the left in a huge circle and as it came around the circle, i could see more of the colored light, exactly as if it were and vegas lcd scrolling around the circumference of a huge, circular disk. about 6 to 10 of these very fast pulsations of colored light came from the exact same spot way behind the light, circled around a huge disk shaped object and came in to full view to me and ended at the light that was still showing at me. this was one giant pulse of about 6 to 8 individual scrolling lights which made the outline of a circular disk. but the disk was on a tilt slightly, about 15 degrees, so the lights went slightly up, over and downward and then abruptly ended at the white light that had stayed on the entire time, about 10 to 12 seconds. i was so shocked by this......i pulled the bike over on the shoulder of the highway. the wind was so fast, it about blew it over. i was speechless at what i had just seen and was hoping for it to appear to me again. some time went by as i had resumed riding and the light never appeared close to me again. however, i saw the light one more time. it had flown way off in the distance, just above the horizon, very far from me, south, where it blinked one more time as if it had lost interest in me.......and was now searching for someone else to totally freak out. i felt as if this thing was momentarily interested in me somehow. it didn't seem hostile in any way.....moreover, it seemed to want to show me that it was not a plane or helicopter that i kept insisting it was in my mind. why? i don't know. the last even, the pulsation, was absolutely beautiful. it revealed a disk shape, 180 degrees of a half circle, in the most brilliant orange and red light i have ever seen, except a cutting torch, maybe. i could always see stars behind it which i am now even more convinced it was cloaked, but the pulses did reveal a huge semi-circle. i had not been driking, nor was i tired nor was i on any kind of medication or drugs of any kind. there was no reason for my mind to be impared what-so-ever. i know what i saw but i can't explain the reason for any of it. question: has anyone else reported this or a similar event over the bonneville salt flats, in utah?"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Salt Lake City and Elco,","Date of the Event":"07/27/2009 07:00 UTC","Case Number":"18413","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18413.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18413.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Windy","Latitude":"40.507092","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Descending lights, close encounter, sphere, 3, strobe, disk.","Longitude":"-113.001199","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.507092,+-113.001199(18413)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18413) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Salt Lake City and Elco,","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
