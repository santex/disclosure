It was a half moon this night. it was fairly bright . i sat down around 11pm after putting my daughter to bed to do my nightly routine of star watching etc., I noticed some lights in the middle of the field....and knew there was not a home there and the lights were steady small burning and white to led in color. no blinking and so i looked through the binoculars to see it closer because i have never seen that before....what i saw next gave me intense fear and my blood pressure dropped because in disbelief i saw a whitish disk shaped object partially hidden by a tree and brush on the left side where the lights were and sticking out to the side about 20 feet or so was a craft....i was just in awe and looking at it when a four-legged dark looking animal of some sort (later found out it was a dog because in a few minutes it came up my driveway and was just sniffing around)jumped up on the craft and started walking around....it was at that time that 4 to 5 creatures, beings or human upright type beings appeared and chased the animal off of the craft....it went to the edge and jumped off and one of the creatures, light in color but i could not see details....only that it was fairly short about three or four feet high ran and did an unbelievable leap from the edge of the ship....looked like a flea jumping..all of the creatures movements were weird like out of a different time....like they would move in fast forward and then stop and slow and then fast forward again. i was very scared at what i was seeing but i was determined to watch and decided to vent my blinds so they may not see me. i did not want to make contact for fear of abduction or something and i have a small daughter. so i just observed all night long. i thought for a moment that they were stranded. they had gotten so close to us, all the houses but nobody had on porch lights etc and were already in bed, i guess. i wondered that they were so bold as to be so close but thought they might have had craft problems. the lights were fading slowly over time like the craft was losing power....then it looked like a signal light in the shape of three pinpoints of light forming a triangle only was left appearing....kind of like some distress signal. the beings were down off of the craft milling around the base and then disappeared into the woods behind the craft. i saw some flashes of elongated laser type lights here and there like they were throwing something or striking something. i kept thinking that they may be waiting for another ship to come and get them....but what about their ship? was it going to be hauled off by some ufo tow ship? i was going to watch to find out. i watched until around 3:45am when i noticed some more activity around the craft. no lights still except for an occasional small faint light in the upper corner of the part of the craft behind the tree side....then it would go off, then ten or fifteen minutes later it would come on again...then go off. it was around four am that i started thinking they had better get their craft out or people will be seeing this in daylight. i saw that the craft looked like it was covered by some kind of tarp or something because it looked like wrinkles were in it...very strange. several creatures were jumping around and on top of the craft and then going back in woods....and at one time sneaked or moved over to the corner of one of the houses close to me and i did not want to see it coming any closer so i put my binoculars down and closed my blinds....really it just scared me too much.....i decided to turn on my carport light ....maybe it would scare them off or something and they would know people were waking up etc....i did that.....and left it on for five minutes. then turned it back off and went back to observe...i fully expected the whole thing to be gone....but NO it was not....craft still there...i wanted to see it take off or get beamed up or whatever so i was still waiting.....then about 5:30 am still no sun....it was to rise at 7:19 am., i noticed that the craft looked slightly different again....this time it had a black opening on the side like part of it opened up....maybe they all evacuated. this is what i was thinking...it was then i looked up to the far left of the sky and saw what looked like a bright steady star....but it was moving...in a shaking hovering type pattern moving right then down some then right then down then stationary then right .....like it was coming my way and to the forest there....i thought this might be the ship to either get them or the mother ship or something.....when it got close to the tree line i did not see it anymore. it was then that a weird shift took place with the ship....it moved or vibrated right to left but did not disappear...i kept watching until the sun was coming up just enought for me to make out that now what i was looking at was a red Mitzubishi car!!! did the ship morph itself into a car? I know that i know i was not looking at a car all night....what about the lights? the creatures? i KNOW i saw them!!! how clever of them to turn the ship into something non threatening as a car.....it seemed....then someone can just come and haul it away....or drive it or something. i really was wondering why the military or police were not coming out there....i was not going to call..... i did not want to get marked....i also would have loved to document this with pictures etc. but as i said was scared to draw attention to myself with flash etc. because i have a five year old sleeping in the house. anyway i did take pics of the red car. i found out later that it was my neighbors car. when she went outside to leave for work her car was rolled over into the field or placed there somehow and she did not know how. she thought she just forgot to put it in park and it rolled there! i was watching all night and never saw it roll out there....it was morphed there or something....the creatures tried to fool me. i know what i saw and it was very disturbing to me and i want to know why they were here and who they are. i also did an experiment. red cars do not look white even in moonlight....the craft i saw was solid white. I have not told but two people. it was the single most bizarre, frightening and upsetting thing i have experienced. I want to take a lie detector test to prove to myself it really happened."],"Date of the Event":"10/15/2010 11:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"11/07/2010 05:59 UTC","Summary":"disk bottom curved edges smaller dome on top white or reflective in color, as it was lit by moonlite","Log Number":"US-11072010-0008","Source":"MUFON"}
