{"divs":["sighting detailsi was on my morning bike ride on 06\\22\\11 around 7:30 am i stopped to take a break, before i turned to go back home. i noticed the sun was very bright and peeking thru the clouds looked inspirational. i thought i would take a picture of it to post on my f.b for inspirational words on exersice. so when i came home i opened the picture to post and show my wife how pretty the sun was. it was then i noticed this oval amber light. i couldn't explain it, i thought maybe a reflection of the moon. my wife had said the moon wouldn't be over the sun. so i thought i would post it and see if i can find any corkey comments on my f.b. at school people said wow looks crazy i agreed. so i thought i would send it in and see if you guys had any leads or what you think. i called national ufo sightings and the guy was rude so i decided to bring the picure here instead. like i said i didn't know it was there at the time it didn't make a noise. if you look in the picture there is amber the reflects around the clouds as well."],"Object Features":"Dome","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Oval Amber shape cought on Camera in Crystal Lake il by the beach.","Region":"Illinois","Object Shape":"Oval","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"29700","Date Submitted":"06/24/2011 01:23 UTC","Log Number":"US-06242011-0009","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29700.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29700_submitter_file1__ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29700.html"],"Longitude":"-89.393578","trends":[""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.642445,+-89.393578(29700)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29700) map </A>","Latitude":"40.642445","Date of the Event":"06/22/2011 07:30 UTC","Tags":"City"}
