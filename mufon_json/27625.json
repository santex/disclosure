(deleted) lives in highland and is one of those puzzled by what she saw. \"i don't believe in extra-terrestrials.��������� but she also doesn���������t believe the lights were from airplanes or helicopters. she says they didn���������t make a sound, and there were no blinking lights, just a constant red. \"i noticed over the roof of the garage a red light and white light and the red light isn't flashing like a plane light and that's what draws my attention to it.\" she says soon there were three red lights and those lights started dropping white streams. (deleted) was a few miles away in american fork. he was in the parking lot of a shopping plaza when he saw the lights hanging in the sky. galbraith was in the air force and says his experience caused him to take special notice of the unusual lights. he grabbed his cell phone and started taking video. (deleted) said, \"they looked like they were flying in formation perfectly together and then whatever was dropping looked like it was burning real bright.\" (deleted) says he doesn���������t believe the trails of white that dropped straight down from the red lights were flares. he says military flares don���������t look like that. \"they usually shoot out the sides, or they shoot down, and there are a lot of them and you could definitely hear them.\" he says there was no sound. he says he could not make out the shape of the flying objects, but says they were unlike any plane or helicopter he has ever seen, and they were flying at an unusual altitude. (deleted) husband also witnessed the lights and streams. he was once an employee of a company that manufactured components for military flares. (deleted) says he could not identify what the flying objects were, but agrees with galbraith���������s assessment that what was being released was not a flare. ���������after a couple of seconds he knew it wasn���������t a flare. he didn���������t know what it was.��������� no one else seems to know either. the control tower at the provo airport had no reports of anything unusual last night, nor did the utah county sheriffs department. salt lake international's control tower had no incidents documented, and officials at camp williams also had nothing to report. both witnesses we talked to say the objects eventually just flew away."],"City":"Highland","Summary":"Three red lights appeared between 7:15 and 7:30.
