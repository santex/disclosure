Normally we have areplances and sea resuce operations going on all the time. But I think last night's event was something else. the hum of the noise was loud, and the lights were a v shape I think you know what i mean. I am a person who doesn't take this lightly are if something strange goes on around here. I was talking to my younger sister on the phone and saying it to her. Talk about being surprised!.. As to say who'd believe in these things. It happened around nine O'clock our time. There have been other events of lights appearing in the sky here over the bay, and have being record on you tube. I am sorry I didn't get it on video or phone as I was talking at the time and quiet shocked. Hope you'll understand this. I am yours sincerely, Mr Mark F Gillan"],"Country":"Ireland","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32508.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32508.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.348694,+-6.259594(32508)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32508) map </A>","Date of the Event":"10/09/2011 09:10 UTC","Longitude":"-6.259594","Summary":"Hovering over my home here in Sandycove Co Dublin Ireland","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"32508","Log Number":"IE-10102011-0012","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"County Dublin"}
