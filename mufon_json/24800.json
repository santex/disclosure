I was basically just looking down toward the ground. I can only assume our altitude was around 15000 ft, due to the fact that we had already been descending toward the airport. It was around 8:00 PM Eastern Time. The sun was beginning to set in the west, which was almost directly to my right, perpendicular to our path south toward the airport. While looking down toward the ground, I noticed what looked to be a silver sphere-shaped object approximately a thousand or so feet below, traveling the opposite direction that our jet was traveling. It looked about the size of a volkswagen beetle. There were no wings. It traveled in a straight course, without deviation. I watched the object cross my viewing region for only about 5 seconds."],"trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There was one other sighting in Philadelphia on or around July 18th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.954555,+-75.154409(24800)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24800) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Tags":"City"}
