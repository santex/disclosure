I mentioned it to my husband and just a few moments later it changed into a boomerang shape, and then vanished from sight. I would guess that the entire incident lasted less than a minute, and I'm very curious if anybody else noticed this. The light never appeared to move or travel, it stayed stationary, changed shape and then disappeared."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.964176,+-82.989584(25930)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25930) map </A>","Date of the Event":"10/13/2010 06:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.964176","Object Shape":"Boomerang"}
