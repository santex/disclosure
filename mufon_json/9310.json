I saw the object for about 5 seconds before it was nearly going over my home but it was slightly to the north of me. This thing went by at an unearthly speed, did not change directions and was completely silent. I watched the object streak away from me heading southwest. I estimate the object traveled horizon to horizon in 10-15 seconds. The atmosphere was very clear at the time of my sighting but there were a few scattered low clouds. The object seemed to be flying just above the low clouds and was flying parallel to the ground. It was extremely hard to make out the shape due to the brightness and speed but it appeared to be a classic saucer shaped UFO. There was an amazing bright white glow around the object as it passed by and it was stunningly beautiful. I did have a camera phone in my pocket but obviously had no time to attempt a picture. It���s been about two hours since my UFO sighting and my heart is still racing with excitement. What was most shocking to me was how low this UFO was flying for such a remarkable speed and that it was silent! There must be others who witnessed what I saw."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.880334,+-117.562078(9310)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9310) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/27/2008 06:01 UTC","Summary":"Very bright brilliant white object flying low altitude at absurdly stunning speed.","City":"Corona","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"01/27/2008 06:01 UTC"}
