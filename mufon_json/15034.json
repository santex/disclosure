It was very clear and still light out, just at dusk and I was observing Venus in the SW and Sirius in the SE , moments before there was nothing in the sky .. I'm sure because I was amazed at how clear it was. Then suddenly this object was there right above me moving very slowly , i thought it was a plane at first but it was odd.. i couldn't SEE the body of it although it was right there about 20 ft above me and not quite dark , i couldn't see the sky or any stars through it either, so something was there but nothing I could make out.. it was like lights on a shadow. I couldn't understand what I was seeing the whole time for about 3 minutes it was right there and moving very slowly but all I could really 'see' were the red lights blinking , I was stunned and frozen there but not really afraid , kind of in a daze .. no one was home (of course) to share this with .. it was moving sooo slowly , I kept trying to focus on it to see what it was , that's the odd part.. if it was a plane that close I could have seen the pilot or windows or something ! It took so long to move , 3 minutes to cross my yard (150ft) Then went over my neighbors house and then just disappeared . A plane would have been easily visible for miles going in that direction (East toward the Ocean). There has never been a plane here that low or ever one moving in that direction and I look at the sky alot ! There was a whooshing sound which didn't make sense to me , it seems that something that large and close would make a much louder and different sound. It didn't seem that the sound was actually connected with it.. very hard to explain.. thanks for listening !"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15034.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15034.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Longitude":"-81.201101"}
