i hope so, because it would really mean alot to us if someone else experienced what we did. im happy to share the videos and stills with you but it will only show you the moon and its cloud mass and the little white circle, but i have no way of proving to you that we were not able to see it without the camera. listen, i wouldnt bother reporting it but i am baffled and a bit frightened by the whole experience. my son and i have been having the worst unexplained anxiety today.we both woke up very early and sat quietly in the livingroom sipping coffee just looking at each other without talking about it. it is physically impossible to have this happen isnt it? we have been trying to talk about it, but it just makes no sense at all. so after deciding that we were not going to make sense of this episode, i decided to write mufon. maybe their is a reason and we just dont know enough about it. thank you for reading this long drawn out mess of a case. we would very much appreciate any light you could shed on our sighting. if you can instruct me on how to get the video and stills off my cell phone and to you i will do so, im afraid i dont have alot of experience with this (iphone) maybe i can email directly off of the phone to an email address of your choosing. call me if you are interested in the footage okay!!! regards [names removed\\cms\\tg]"],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Barnstable","There were no other sightings in Barnstable on or around September 26th 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.638417,+-70.294996(25579)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25579) map </A>","Log Number":"US-09272010-0002","Case Number":"25579"}
