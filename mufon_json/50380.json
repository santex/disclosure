As I walked to my car, I noticed a group of 3 BRIGHT lights in the sky. Normally I'd just assume that it was an airplane. However this was different; the object remained stationary. Est. time stationary was 5-7min. The object hovered then slowly just dissipated, but did not move. There were no clouds in the sky where I observed the lights. From what I could see, the lights made a triangle pattern, and vaguely you could see what looked to be some sort of wings coming from the side of the object. Very strange as there were no stars in the sky and not on the direct flight path to the airport. I tried to take a picture but strangely my phone would not power on."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.418194,+-111.823022(50380)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50380) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-111.823022","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Wings, Unknown","Date Submitted":"09/02/2013 11:16 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","Region":"Arizona"}
