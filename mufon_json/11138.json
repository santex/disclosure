We happened to look up and saw a triangle shaped object slowly passing just above the building top level. It had several white circles on the bottom of it, but they were not illuminated. The object was completely without lights. It was moving very slowly and actually crossed the strip. We were in the vicinity of the Mirage hotel. It made no noise at all that we could hear. I have never seen a flying object move so slowly - or this size - it was very large. To this day we still do not know what it was."],"trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around March 31st 2002"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-06122008-0006","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"03/31/2002 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"11138","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.118286,+-115.169336(11138)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11138) map </A>","Region":"Nevada","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
