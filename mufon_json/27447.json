We knew immediately that it wasn't something normal and opened the car window but heard no sound whatsoever. My 40 year old son was driving the car and opened his window to watch and listen. I was in the front passenger seat, my wife in the back. They slowly drifted toward the east but the configuration of the lights was unchanging. Again, the lights were not blinking as you would expect on an aircraft. The arc was tilted approximately 30 degrees towards us. The lights disappeared one by one but we couldn't determine if it was behind wisps of clouds or not. The moon was out (a little larger than half) and there didn't appear to be any significant cloud cover. Unfortunately, we were too stunned to take out a camera."],"Source":"MUFON"}
