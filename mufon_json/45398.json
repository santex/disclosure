My father was next to me feeding my new baby. I looked out of the windows which had the blinds all up so you could see all of outside. We live near a large hill and that is where I saw it. I just sat still and shocked and could not even say anything to my dad until it was gone. It was shaped like a large circle and appeared on top of that hill. I thought about a UFO when I saw it. It had 4 yellow lights on the bottom and one large red light on the top of it. I watched it move slowly to the east and then it was just gone. I told my dad, but he really didn't know what to say. He thought it may be an airplane to check the light but it was too low and too close to be a plane of any kind. I called a friend because I was so scared when my dad left and I stayed with her until my husband got home at 1 AM.
