I was on campus at Shenandoah University, walking to my car after my 10 o'clock class. I noticed what looked like a star to the north, the direction I was walking. When I first noticed the object It was at its brightest, far to bright be be a star at 11 am. The object was stationary for the entire time it was observable, though it changed its luminosity often. I watched it for about 30 minutes until it became so dim that it was unobservable. I was able to film it for a short time. There was a handfull of us who witnessed it. I know of at least one other who took a picture. I had a feeling of amazement and excitement at seeing the object. I've been looking up hoping to see something for about a year now, and actually what I was expecting to see is exactly what I saw. Not a \"flying saucer\", but a stationary light in the sky that is not a \"known\" aircraft, at least to me, nor was it anything that can be explained by a natural occurrence."],"Region":"Virginia"}
