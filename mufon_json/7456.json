{"Date of the Event":"07/16/2007 08:47 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving to work a bright object caught my eye a few inches above the treeline but definitely a couple miles away. Tried to follow it with eyes while staying on road but lost visual after a minute, due to treeline. About 1 minute later I noticed a pair of fighter jets in formation, flying at very low altitude, and they appeared to zoom in the direction of where the UFO had appeared to be heading (towards the ocean)."],"Region":"Florida","Case Number":"7456","Country":"United States","Latitude":"30.166663","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Panama City","There were no other sightings in Panama City on or around July 16th 2007"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7456.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7456.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07162007-0002","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Very Reflective Object Heading North to South","City":"Panama City","Longitude":"-85.651086","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.166663,+-85.651086(7456)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7456) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/16/2007 08:47 UTC"}
