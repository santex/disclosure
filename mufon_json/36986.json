Some years ago I saw a Space Shuttle fly over. It was faster than that, but not as fast as a meteor. This can probably be explained, but it seemed odd to me. I was outside our barn, and just happened to look up and see it. I lost sight of it behind our house. It was a great distance away. I'm curious if anyone else saw it, and what an explanation could be."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36986.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36986.html"],"Case Number":"36986","Object Features":"Unknown"}
