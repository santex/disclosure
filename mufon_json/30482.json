{"Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside for a smoke at around 2AM and saw a Glowing object hovering over the Devil's Backbone in Estes Park. This happens almost every night with 3 different colors coming from Craft, Then you will see a Stealth do a Fly over the Front Range of Northern Colorado and the Object is too far away for pictures and would like to have this object investigated and would be willing to show where we live and what it does just about every night around 12AM to 3AM, From our place we can see the object floating and then disappearing later in the night as if a Landing Party is sent out, I am not one to boast about Aliens but there has to be something out there besides ourselves. I will Video in the Future and would like to camp out there and watch it from that perspective."],"Date of the Event":"07/28/2011 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-105.113278","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.442966,+-105.113278(30482)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30482) map </A>","Latitude":"40.442966","Sighting Duration":"01:30:00","Log Number":"US-08082011-0017","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30482.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30482.html"],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval, Saturn-like, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Colorado","Case Number":"30482","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Loveland","There were no other sightings in Loveland on or around July 28th 2011"],"Date Submitted":"08/08/2011 08:15 UTC","Disposition":"Hoax","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","City":"Loveland","Summary":"Glowing Lights Every Night Over Estes Park since January of 2011"}
