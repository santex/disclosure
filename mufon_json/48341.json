I went back to directing and after an unknown amount of time I looked up to see it again but I thought it was a star. Then I realized the clouds in front of the moon. I looked at the object and saw it as a red light with a blue aura around it. I kept an eye on it for 10-20 minutes. I saw it move slowly to the left before stopping again. I then watched it slowly descend straight down behind a building. There was fireworks in the area which I think attracted it."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"48341","Summary":"Red light with blue aura around it.
