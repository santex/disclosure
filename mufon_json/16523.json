(christchurch is a very small city and at 12pm on a monday night it becomes very still). there are also very few helicopters that operate out of the christchurch airport and they have a very distinct sound that can you can hear for miles (the airport is less than 5 kilometres from where i live and to the north of the object. 4. balloons\\blimps: there are no blimps here in new zealand and hot air balloons are not allowed to fly at night over the city. above all normal aircraft do not just simply vanish as this craft did. other strange effects to add to this are some odd electrical effects shortly before i went out for a cigarette. the lights in the house flicked twice as well as the radio producing static. the power here can get a little odd at times due to all the substations in and around the city sending power to the north island and we get power spikes on and off so i put it down to that at first but now i am not so sure. sorry i do not have a photo of the object as i did not have my cam at home as it was at work."],"Region":"Canterbury","Log Number":"NZ-04162009-0002","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Cigar","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Christchurch","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Christchurch","There were no other sightings in Christchurch on or around April 13th 2009"],"Latitude":"-43.532054","Date of the Event":"04/13/2009 11:50 UTC"}
