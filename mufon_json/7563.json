It hovered for few moments and then disappeared. Then I saw another appear underneath it to the left. Then they both disappeared then another appeared to the right of those two. Then the other two reappeared and I drove off. I called my wife and told her, and all of my children in the car saw the objects as well. The oldest wouldn't venture into the basement in fear of aliens after we returned home.....Wierd! I normally don't even look into things like this, but after what I saw I needed to find an outlet to share. Please if anyone else saw these shining objects post on here as well. Oh yeah and they were shiny metal. Like white metal."],"Region":"Ohio","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.15784,+-83.075187(7563)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7563) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/31/2007 05:17 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07312007-0003","Object Shape":"Circle","Case Number":"7563","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Powell","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-83.075187","Summary":"Three very bright shining circles with a half oval tops appearing and dissapearing in the clear sky.","Date of the Event":"07/31/2007 05:17 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
