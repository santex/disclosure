As I stepped onto my front porch I spotted the light above the western slope of the same nearby mountain where this event had occurred in the past; the light appeared to be approx 400' - 500' above the horizon in the Northwestern Sky (almost directly below Venus). As I continued to observe, the light began moving horizontally very slowly in a Northerly direction and at the same time the altitude was dropping slowly. This horizontal and vertical movement continued until approximately 8:24 pm. During this period of time I observed that the light dimmed and brightened 3 times. By 8:41 the light then began to descend more quickly and by 8:54 pm it had dropped below the tree-line."],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35895.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35895.html"],"Log Number":"US-02172012-0028","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
