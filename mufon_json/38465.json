{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette. I just happened to glance up at the blue sky and see a commercial jet flying to the s.west. Then I saw what I thought was the front of another jet going to collide in the air. I kept blinking my eyes to get a better focus on the objects. Thats when I noticed they did not collide and the second object that was flying west was not a plane but a very large silver cigar shape object, no wings, no sound, which is hard to hear in the city anyways.I thought is it a rocket, I was in aw just watching this object fly across the sky heading west fast dont know how fast, but faster than a jet. I watched the object fly into a cloud then out of it and I was in aw could not pull myself away from watching this. It flew across the sky till it was out of my sight of the screened in porch,it flew west in a straight line, heading towards n.Cleveland or there about."],"Longitude":"-80.812177","Summary":"very long silver cigar shaped craft flying approx. west a jet was flying s.westwatched ufo as it flew across the blue sky.","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05232012-0022","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.239927,+-80.812177(38465)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38465) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38465.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38465.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/21/2012 03:40 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Warren","There were no other sightings in Warren on or around May 21st 2012"],"Latitude":"41.239927","Region":"Ohio","Case Number":"38465","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Warren","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder","Date Submitted":"05/23/2012 07:28 UTC"}
