{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was station on NAS Jax a Navy air station and I was attending my course required by all military personnel who ride motorcycles and just happened to look up at the sky due to a incident I had years before that caused me to become a sky watcher now, and noticed a silver sphere looked similar to a be be or ball bearing maybe even a oval or cylinder like. I didn't want to seem weird so I didn't make a big deal just watched it close. at a point we had to all get on the start of the obstacle course on our motorcycles to start the program and when I got to the location where we began, I looked up and the object was gone. All this was within a 5 min time frame. I looked up several times at the object which was really high up, but the lack of movement really made me curious about it."],"Case Number":"45965","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-81.702054","Date of the Event":"09/05/2009 08:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Orange Park","Latitude":"30.175434","Summary":"seen a object high up, that looked like a silver be-be for a be be gun just not moving just sitting in same spot.","Object Shape":"Circle, Cylinder, Sphere","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/28/2013 04:18 UTC","Region":"Florida","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.175434,+-81.702054(45965)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45965) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45965.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45965.html"],"Object Features":"Dome","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Orange Park","There were no other sightings in Orange Park on or around September 5th 2009"],"Log Number":"US-02282013-0016"}
