I had believed it was a satellite until a change in altitude drop and course change to northeast of 30 degrees. Object gave off star like reflection while traveling then went dark. Object reappeared further northeast and then committed a dramatic course change in altitude of about 75 degrees, causing a flame trail behind object while exiting Earth���s atmosphere. About five to ten seconds later object reapers and beginnings massive bright pulse of light (beyond light reflection, the object was emitting this light pulse). The pulse lasted for about two to three seconds. The object then disperse again and reapers another ten seconds later, once more in different location and on different course, emits the pulse of light once more then changes course to the northeast and goes dark and not seen again."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Oak Harbor","Latitude":"48.302416","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49085.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49085.html"],"Country":"United States"}
