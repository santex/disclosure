It stayed on for about 2 seconds before blinking out.. 5 seconds later the light came back on more intense this time the light had a very noticable red ring around the out side edge of the brilliant white center.. after 10 seconds the light dimmed to a pale blue point of light similar to a star.. 15 seconds later the light disappeared... there was not motion at all.. it was too low in the sky to be a star.. but too high up to be a radio tower.. i watched the exact spot as well as the surronding sky for 45 mins to see if the object would return with no luck..the light appeared to be approximately 5 miles from my position which was 1 mile east of Bledsoe.."],"Summary":"Bright white light with a red ring around it.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","City":"Bledsoe"}
