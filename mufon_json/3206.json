It was flat and long. When I first saw the object, I was drawn to howlarge and glowing it was and low in the sky. It moved at a steady rate of speedfrom West to Northeast decreasing in elevation. The window was open but therewas not sound coming from the object even though it appeared to be very low inthe sky and close. I ran to get the binoculars and watched it for an additional30 seconds through the binoculars and saw one red and one yellow light towardsthe bottom of the object. None of the lights blinked. They were steady. Theobject continued to move at a steady rate downward and went in back of the treesand out of sight."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Blimp","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Nederland","There were no other sightings in Nederland on or around August 24th 2004"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.961376,+-105.510831(3206)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3206) map </A>","City":"Nederland","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
