I was taking pictures of an a amazing sunset, and took a series of shots. When I viewed these on the computer, I then became aware of the craft in the photos. I did also have 3 other shots showing the craft stationary over glacier rock, though at present I am having trouble locating them.Using an editing technique which washes out colour and any solid background, and leaves only metallic objects,,,,I was able to scan all the shots and find craft in most from that series taken on the evening in question. I will include shots using this process and the originals so as the actual shape at time of capture can be seen clearly."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Other","Latitude":"-16.728626","Region":"Queensland","Summary":"I was taking photos of a very spectacular sunset.
