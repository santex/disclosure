{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was traveling along RT322 in Atlantic Co., NJ when at around 4:40 PM I saw some distance ahead of me a moving distortion in the (fairly solid & darkish) clouds that appeared as a very fast large 'cloaked' triangle shape moving at high speed. It appeared several times larger than I would expect a passenger jet to appear at that distance. I was traveling east to west, the distortion moved from north to south. It was in my field of view for not more than 2 seconds. It was like there was a 'cloaked' large triangular 'flying wing' turned on its side. Think of the distortion of the jungle in the movie Predator when the alien moved while cloaked. That is how a part of the clouds looked. I thought, \"What the hell was that!\" It is the first time I have seen something that I can not explain. I don't believe it was 'alien', but something natural & outside of my experience. I would love to know just what it was."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34043.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34043.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.423333","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Weymouth","Weather Factors":"None","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/15/2011 08:23 UTC","Case Number":"34043","Log Number":"US-12152011-0016","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Weymouth","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-74.788333","Region":"New Jersey","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.423333,+-74.788333(34043)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34043) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/13/2011 04:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"'Invisable' triangular UFO","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
