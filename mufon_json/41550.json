While waiting a internaly lite ball came over my roof top into my back yard right over my head It also had a small blinking light that did not seem to be attached to it but was right behind the ball very closeto it blinking at a steady rythum the color of the strobe looked like LED light while the ball was white in color and internly lighted. As Iwached it rasied up to tree top level while itmoved forward.inside to get my camera when I cmae back out it was past the trees and out of sight.
