I thought it could have been a plane, but plane lights don't encase the entire vehicle, and can be distinctly seen to be flashing and just at wing tips, or a bright white light when traveling toward you. These appeared to traveling in a line and disappeared fairly quickly, after they got to about 60 degrees from the horizon, almost like they went higher. They were observed from 60 degrees to overhead to 60 degrees then vanished."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.67748,+-98.403278(48483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48483) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"48483","Date Submitted":"06/28/2013 11:55 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48483.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Latitude":"29.67748","trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There were no other sightings in San Antonio on or around June 28th 2013"]}
