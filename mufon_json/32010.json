As I approached 40 hwy near Independence MO I noticed a white light in the sky towards my right. The lights were in a bow like arc shape. There were approx 4-5 lights. They would change color. When they changed color all the lights would be the same color. From white, to red, to blue. It was making all these crazy maneuvers in the sky. Super fast like. Then it would stop and then start the maneuvers again. Then it suddenly shot off in super fast speed. Traffic was slowing down so it seems like other people noticed it too. It lasted about 2 and a half mins. I called my mother while I was looking at it. I have never seen anything like this ever in my 22 yrs of life."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Kansas City","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-09222011-0020","Latitude":"39.106832","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were no other sightings in Kansas City on or around September 22nd 2011"]}
