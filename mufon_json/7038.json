{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking my dog east. Our street is dark. Saw this object moving slowly north. It looked like it got brighter then dimmer. When I saw this thing take a right angle turn is when I freaked out. Did I just really see that? When I got home I let my other dogs out. I was still in shock that I saw something like that happen. So I went out side again to see if I could somehow see this thing again and get lucky. After a min later another lite came into focus. moving from south to north it got brighter, stopped then Just took off. I had a strange feeling it knew I was watching it! I know, Sounds crazy.
