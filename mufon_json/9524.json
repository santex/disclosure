The three of us, my 17 year old, my husband and I saw a very bright light in the night sky. It had a white light quality, very intense, periodically changing colors to red, darting around in the sky to the southwest. It was obvious it was not a helicopter or other, due to the fact that it would dart too quickly to the far left and right, drop down a very far distance and come back up to where it was before. We watched this for almost two hours, as it changed positions, sometimes fading out and then coming back to the same intensity of light. As we were watching it, it just disappeared completely."],"Log Number":"US-02102008-0007","City":"cms/tg n/a","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9524"}
