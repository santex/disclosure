By night I was very sore (back injury), and asked my roommate to take my dogs out before he went to bed, he didn't. About 2:15am my dogs woke me up, it took me ten minutes to get out of bed and get dressed. As we walked in front of the house I noticed the moon towards the south, then something in the west caught my attention. Eight objects, shaped like ameba's glowing orange, just over the Spring Mtns. They were side by side like they were racing, jockeying for position. They slowly gained altitude as they raced towards the east and went out of sight. I never heard a thing on the news and didn't know who to talk to about it until I saw a show on cable tonight on UFON."],"Object Shape":"Cylinder, Other","Region":"Nevada","Tags":"City","Case Number":"33465","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33465.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33465.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.24488,+-115.213994(33465)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33465) map </A>","City":"Las Vegas"}
