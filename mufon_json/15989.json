I looked to the west and spotted a stationary orange planet like light. This was the brightest light in the sky. The sky was cloudless. I could see the stars clearly. The light faded in and out, from dim and small to bright and bigger. I called my husband to come and take a look. He saw the light too. Then he pulls out a green laser that is very powerful and he points it at the light in the sky. Then my husband blinks the laser twice. The light suddenly blinks out. We have not seen the light again this evening. We will looking out for and will report back any happenings."],"Longitude":"-84.762159","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.87566","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"03/12/2009 08:30 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hiram","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"03/12/2009 08:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-03122009-0018","Case Number":"15989","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"Georgia","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Summary":"Star-like object in sky, stationary orange tinge.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15989.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15989.html"]}
