it (the light) appeared, continued to increase in brightness, then seemed to fly towards our direction, very slowly and with no sound (so it appeared), and then blinked out, to be clear -- it did not fade out, or slowly dim, it specifically \"turned off.\" i consider myself to be somewhat (as well as my brother)an ametuar skywatcher; we have a celeston nexstar 130 slt and love gazing at the stars. our feelings were of amazement, nervousness, shock, realization, etc. we realized we saw an unidentified object in the sky, one that appeared to be cruising at a very low altitude and speed, with no sound. all of us are familiar with ufology especially what has recently been going on in texas. i am no expert, but if i were to classify this particular type of object, i (and my brother) agree it was somewhat triangular in shape and appeared to be bigger than a helicopter or small plane, but was not bigger than a commercial aircraft. basically the view through the binoculars was filled up with the object, the object and its lights seemed to fit fully within the viewing context (lens of the 8x42 bushnell excursion). as to its location, it was higher than the horizon on the other side of the lake by a few inches, that is to say if you are looking out at the horizon the object was roughly 1-3 inches higher than the green hills on the other side of the lake. we could also clearly tell it was not past the horizon, it appeared to be between us and the other side of the lake, our general consensus was that it was over the lake at the time of our viewing window."],"Case Number":"18325","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.276783"}
