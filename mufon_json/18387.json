arynn, and i am a resident of moorhead, mn. since my early childhood, i have experienced multiple abduction incidients and ufo sightings, however the incident which i will describe here is one of the few in which someone else would be able to confirm it along with me. i was (and am still currently) living in an apartment complex in south moorhead, just off of 20th st. it was myself and my two roommates, both of them brothers. in this report i will refer to them as jeremy and michael. i am still currently living with jeremy, but michael (who was the person who witnessed this event with me) has since moved out and is living with his sister several hours away from here. the approximate date of this incident was mid october of 2008, before halloween if i recall correctly. it took place sometime after 11 pm, but before midninght, and the entire sighting lasted perhaps 3-5 minutes. michael and i had decided to head out to the courtyard of our apartment for a cigarette. the courtyard is on the western side of the building in which we live. i remember that it was a clear, cloudless night, and we had a pretty decent view of the western skyline from where we were standing. michael and i had been talking for a few minutes, i dont recall what about, when i saw what i at first assumed to be a satellite or a very distant airplane moving in the sky, a few miles out over fargo, nd across the red river. the first thing that made me realize that this was not an airplane was that it appeared to be bobbing back and forth up in the air, in a north\\south trajectory. i pointed this out to michael, who as far as i know had never seen any kind of ufo in his life, and he appeared to be completely dumbfounded as to what it was. i also noted that while i could not define the shape of the object, it looked very much like a star from the distance i viewed it at, it seemed to be rotating through a pattern of bright colors, seemingly the entire visual spectrum, plus a few \"colors\" that i can not really define as they don't correspond to anything that i see on a regular basis. now after about a minute or two of staring at this thing floating up in the sky, things took a bit of a twist. it is difficult to describe how i understand this, but i somehow felt this object become aware that i could see it. i felt some sort of consciousness reach out and touch my mind, and my right arm then seemed to \"jump\" of its own will, a completely uncontollable movement. this startled me so much that i immediately looked down at my arm, breaking my view of the object up in the sky. when i looked back up into the sky to find it again, i was suprised to see that it appeared to have moved several hundred yards north of its previous position in a matter of seconds. a few moments later a very loud noise echoed throughout the courtyard, heard by both michael and myself. the sound was very unusual, sounding like an incredibly loud meow of a housecat, but slightly more mechanical. i quickly scanned the courtyard, almost certain something was about to attack me from somewhere around a corner (i have become quite paranoid at times due to the half-remembered events of my childhood experiences.) when i looked back into the sky for the last time to try and locate the object again, it was nowhere to be seen. i am fairly certain that both my arm jumping and the mechanical cat noise were both distraction techniques used by whatever it was that i saw, so that i was unable to witness its more intense movement capabilities. i am also fairly certain that the object was not present for me, but rather for someone else on the other side of the border. after it had disappeared, i questioned michael as to what he thought it was, and he seemed almost as if he wanted to avoid talking about it entirely. i have yet to see another object since that evening, although i have been experiencing flashback memories more and more frequently since then, and am having dreams about ets and ufos on an almost nightly basis. lately after having these dreams i have been waking up with intense headaches, sometimes persisting all day. i have been looking for answers to these questions for a number of years now, and i feel like i am getting closer to the truth than i have ever come before."],"Summary":"A short sighting witnessed by myself and a roommate west of my current residence,
