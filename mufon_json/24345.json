I turned to go inside and I just glanced at a light coming from the sky. I was like wow, and turned aroud. There was a ball that looked most like a fireball. It was moving realy fast across the sky from SE to NW. It slowed down so fast it was like an instant stop. But before it stoped it had three lines behind it. they disappeared one by one. After all of them were gone a little little one appeared out of nowhere. A realy bright long gray light hit the tip of the moutains. The little one just stayed there. Lastly the big one shot of so fast i almost didn't see it. Then the little one zig-zag across the sky following the bigger one. And all of it was gone."],"Region":"Arizona","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24345.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24345.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/08/2010 04:33 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07082010-0004","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:41 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Fireball, Sphere, Square, Rectagular"}
