Around that star was a star-like light orbiting and after a few seconds it disappeared. A couple of minutes later when I was arriving home I saw a second light like the first one but flying straight. Behind that secong light was flying a very brighter light on same line and direction. Then, the lead light disappeared and seconds after that disappeared the \"wingman\" brighter light. I don't know what was any of the lights. It wasn't a plane (I know when I see a plane) and I think it couldn't be a comet or a death star because first one was flying in circles and others were flying on formation. A few seconds after watching the first light I started to percibe a sound like the hum that kept on my head till I arrived home. The sound was in the ambience."],"City":"San SebastiÃƒÂ¡n de los Reyes","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41106.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41106.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41106.html"],"Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in San Sebastián de los Reyes","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Longitude":"-3.632984"}
