I was using a sonydigital cam to take photos. I happened to notice that in the series of photos, Ihad captured a small red star-like dot which first appears on the lunar horizon,and then moved several degrees across the face of the moon and slightly north. Ablow up of the object from several shots reveals the same structure. Somethinglike two red donuts stuck together. I suppose some people may say its anartifact caused by the camera, but I doubt an artifact would look like donuts. Ishould add I have just completed my grad diploma in astronomy and am somewhatfamiliar with the subject of TLPs."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2667.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2667.html"],"Object Features":"Other","Summary":"Possible TLP seen during Lunar Eclipse","Longitude":"-74.969333","Date of the Event":"11/09/2003 07:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/09/2003 07:00 UTC"}
