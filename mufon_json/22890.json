{"Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw one of these two weeks ago but got too busy to report the sighting. And I did not have my camera. Yesterday I saw another one and then two appeared side by side hovering above the clouds. I ran and got my camera and the battery would not work and it was fully charged. I finally got it to work and noticed they were barely visible anymore. They were gaining altitude fast. Then the clouds came through very heavy but I started shooting anyway and held the camera steady on the tripod and just started shooting . I downloaded the footage and could see them but they were so high up at this point. I will share the pics anyway. I will be keeping my eyes in the sky more now for better shots!
