I saw a bright light that appeared to be a planet or bright star. I don't ever recall seeing a planet in this location so took a quick photo. The sun had not come up yet. The photo shows a light in the sky but upon zooming in a triangle shaped object can easily be seen. There is a bright light on each of the three points of the triangle. At first I did not think it was a UFO and still don't but it's very unusual looking. I did not lose sight of it, I had to go to work and figured I had not photographed anyting important until I looked at it later. In addition I saw another object and photographed it. I have no idea what it is but it appears to be moving."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Latitude":"39.844683","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.844683,+-105.034875(16948)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16948) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"16948","Weather Factors":"None"}
