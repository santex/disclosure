Saw object. Took shot number one with camera phone. Brief time period. Actually SAW the image - it wasn't a reflection. Object in shot #1 disappeared then re-appeared to the left and further away - near the ground in second #2 as a solid orb - it appears to be light emitting. The third shot shows the object taking off to the right. The individual was in Central Florida and must remain anonymous. The person shared the photos with me. She experienced a brief sensation of \"timelessness\". She said she really didn't \"feel\" anything.
