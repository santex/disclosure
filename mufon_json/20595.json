{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approximately 19:33 2 miles west of Santo TX, I was in the process of feeding my dogs when I noticed out of the corner of eye a bright light. I stopped to look and the bright light began to dim, then immediately a second light illuminated for one second, then a third for one second and then a fourth. After the fourth illumination, I saw 4 tiny white dots moving very slowly across the sky and within a second or two all the lights disappeared. They reappeared in almost the same area, in the same pattern and it happened again for a total of 3 cycles. They were approximately 200ft AGL, 2 miles from our home. The colors were a yellowish orange that seem to change colors and almost flicker"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/18/2009 09:59 UTC","Case Number":"20595","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 128 other sightings in Fort Worth","There were no other sightings in Fort Worth on or around November 18th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Fort Worth","Summary":"The colors were a yellowish orange that seem to change colors and almost flicker","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11182009-0023","Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.730079","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Texas","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20595.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20595.html"],"Longitude":"-97.31717","Date of the Event":"11/18/2009 07:33 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.730079,+-97.31717(20595)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20595) map </A>"}
