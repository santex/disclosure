{"Case Number":"45060","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"01/06/2013 07:33 UTC","divs":["sighting detailson thur jan 3rd i went outside to smoke and was about ready to go to bed. it was about 10:15 pm. i couldn't help but notice what looked like police lights (\"cherries\" or whatever they're called) in the sky to the south. i was pretty sure there weren't any cop cars flying around that night, and the part of the sky i was looking at is a pretty busy flight path. on any day at any time of the day i see planes and especially helicopters flying by, usually flying ne. this was definitely not a plane or helicopter. then, while i was scratching my head \"what the &*%$ is that?!\" a smaller thing like it appeared to fly out of and away from the first object. it's flight trajectory was a sort on parabolic curve toward the ground. and as soon as object #2 disappeared behind background trees and houses i heard a herd of cows about a mile away freak out briefly. nothing really happened; no cows were harmed and the diving craft didn't crash. but seeing that made me realize that there may be more of them. i looked around at the sky and spotted about 4 more of them but all were either smaller or at higher altitude than the first one. the same thing happened every night since then. but every night there seems to be more of them. thursday there were maybe about 3 or 4 of them. friday 1\\4\\13 there were about 6 of them, saturday night at about 1am there were at least 11. while i write this it's about 6:30 pm and they seem to have started early because instead of being on the easter horizon, right now they are almost directly overhead, and other new developments are that they must be lower because they are much easier to see. and about 15 minutes ago i saw something with all of those same flashing lights but is was much closer to the ground and i can see the shape of it (maybe triangle or stealth fighter shape. there are no military bases around here or anything else that should bring so much aircraft other than the usual traffic of private planes, crop duster planes and medical helicopters. tonight is as interesting as all the other nights so, i guess the story continues to unfold."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45060.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45060.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"03:30:01","Date of the Event":"01/03/2013 10:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Yankton","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.456396","Summary":"for 4 consecutive nights, becomes visible on east horizon after dark, then between 8 pm and 6am move across sky going west","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.856998","Log Number":"US-01062013-0012","Country":"United States","Region":"South Dakota","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Yankton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.856998,+-97.456396(45060)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45060) map </A>"}
