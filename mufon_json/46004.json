It was flying in the direction towards me and was overhead my car and I couldn't see it anymore, then I saw another one coming from that direction. I called my husband to meet my outside when I pulled up. My husband came outside with my 2 teenage boys and we watched a total of 6 of them. They were flying low, but ascended into the clouds, and we could not see them after that. We could not tell what kind of object it was, we could only see the light. It didn't blink like an airplane & there was not really a sound. Normally if a plane or helicopter is flying that low we can hear it."],"Case Number":"46004","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-82.444595"}
