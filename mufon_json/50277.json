It gave off this fiery look to it and it moved fast across the horizon. It got bigger and brighter and would hover in certain places at a time and then move swiftly across the horizon without any engine noise. Eventually the UFO passed over us and when it did the bright fiery light went out and it had red and white lights blinking (possibly disguising itself as an airplane). The only way we could tell it wasn't from this Earth is by the lack of noise the engines were making and the immense light that it produced on the horizon. The craft also flew pretty low for an aircraft so I'm pretty sure we should've been able to hear something. It was quite an experience seeing this and it confirmed my belief that we are not alone in this Universe."],"City":"Fairport"}
