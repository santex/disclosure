We stood and watched because we thought they may have been Chinese Lanterns but they definitely were not, as the movement was non uniform. These orbs hovered and then appeared to float together up and towards the ocean until fading away. As we walked we noticed three more of these orbs floating and traveling together before fading, then a group of two, then one, then another one. We asked others on the beach if they knew what they were or if they knew of a lantern festival or something nearby, but others did not seem to care. It seemed as if they were all coming from a similar origin, and we tried to find this origin, but it was unclear exactly where it was. We were very excited to see the orbs and eventually left just because we had to work in the morning. It was a very peaceful and interesting experience."],"Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.751544,+-75.088126(49373)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49373) map </A>","Region":"Delaware","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Rehoboth","Summary":"Orange orbs floated across sky in Rehoboth","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
