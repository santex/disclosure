I decided to look for some UFO's with my bonoculars. At after I walked about 100 feet up Beaver Street. I sweeped the sky in the south with my bonoculars and found nothing. Then I looked towards the west after a couple of seconds, I found a small, white circular object at about forty five degrees above the horizon. It was very small but clearly circular. It was moving slowly towards the west after following it for a minute, I notice it disappeared twice for a second or two. Futher examination showed that the object was flat and when it rotated and showed its flat edge towards me its thinnes made it very hard to see it at that faraway distance. The top of it appeared to be disk like or like a circle. It disappeared or was so small and flat I could not see it anymore. My observation lasted about two minutes in total."],"Summary":"small white round flat object moving west.","Longitude":"-122.466348","City":"Daly City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"6979","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.691694,+-122.466348(6979)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6979) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"37.691694","Date Submitted":"05/06/2007 05:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"05/06/2007 05:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-05072007-0002","Object Shape":"Undisclosed"}
