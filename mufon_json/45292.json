I notice a bright star like light...but it became bigger...I quickly realized that it was coming close and at a point the light became three lights in the distance. as it approached my area i could make out a red centered light. At the point where I had to lean forward towards my windshield in order to keep looking at it, i got out of the car...but in that 2 sec time, it was gone. No sound. The shape was soiid, it blocked stars."]}
