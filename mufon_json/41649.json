{"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08112012-0024","Date of the Event":"08/10/2012 10:59 UTC","divs":["Sighting Details While getting ready to lock up the house I realized my wife had accidentally left the garage door open. As I walked outside to close the garage door I looked up and noticed a large flashing-pulsating object in the sky to the South. At that time I observed planes moving through the sky near the object. The object stayed stationary and was close enough for me to see many brilliant lights flashing from the object. When I observed a plane fly near the object I believed the object was as large as a large passenger plane. I notified the neighbors next door and they were witnesses as well. They were a little shocked to see the object as well and all of us agreed it was doubtful to be a drone or plane. The object moved some distance but very slowly. I then notified the police and an officer came out and also observed the object. He shined his flashlight at the object as well but there was no response. I was able to take some pictures and some video as well. The object did not leave the area for nearly 2 hours. The oddest thing was as as planes were close to the object it looked like the object was as large as a large passenger plane but when the object moved further South it looked like a large pulsating orb. Well that's the scoop from The Woodlands, Texas on 8-10-2012."],"Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"08/11/2012 09:49 UTC","Summary":"Large Pulsating object craft or large orb.
