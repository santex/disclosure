{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was leaving school facing west. I was in my car, but was distracted by an exceptionally bright object in the sky. At first it seemed to be moving due south, so I braked to get a better look at what I thought must be a distant plane. When I stopped I realized the object was not moving, so I ruled it must not be a plane, yet it seemed to be hovering slightly. I thought it might be a star, but the brightness of the object seemed to intensify then dull, and it was far brighter than any star you usually see, reflective like a diamond or glass. It seemed strange, especially since it was still light out. It was weird, but I wasn't really giving it much thought. I looked to the south to check the road, literally for a second, and when I looked back up, the bright sphere had vanished. I searched the sky, but could not relocate it."],"Latitude":"41.859398","Summary":"Star-like sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","City":"Batavia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39819.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39819.html"],"Log Number":"US-06262012-0004","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Longitude":"-88.309154","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.859398,+-88.309154(39819)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39819) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/26/2012 01:00 UTC","Case Number":"39819","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/25/2012 07:45 UTC","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Batavia","There were no other sightings in Batavia on or around June 25th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
