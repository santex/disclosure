I turned in the direction where i believed the sound emanated from and saw the object coming from the West to the East. I live near the airport and no planes come from that direction, that's what grabbed my attention too. I observed the object through a pair of Astronomer binoculars but i still couldn't clearly identify it. It was just a ball of light travelling slowly and silently. no blinking lights of any kind. As it got closer to me it just faded out and disappeared. Visbility was perfect, no clouds at the time. i've heard strange electronic type sounds recently but this is the first time that i could actually link the sound with a UFO sighting. And the sounds come in pairs of 2. what blew me away is the fact that it announced its arrival and the direction it was coming from with the sound i picked up with my right ear. For some reason UFO activity in the Philadelphia area has been intensifying in the past year. others are picking up on it also. something is definitely going on."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.958055,+-75.157969(11906)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11906) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"11906","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"a silent sphere of white light","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11906.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11906.html"]}
