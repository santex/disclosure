{"divs":["sighting detailsi headed out of my house at around 2:15 to skate at a local school. as i rounded the corner from my house, i noticed about a quarter to a third of the se sky light up with a greenish glow. there was a central point(the best way to describe it is an orb\\ball shaped) where the light was more intense than the surrounding area. at first i just thought it was lightning because it had been raining on and off all night. however, the light lingered for about seven or eight seconds. there was no clap\\rumble of thunder as the light appeared or after it was gone. i've never seen anything produce this quality\\color in the night sky. after the light disappeared, the streetlights along my street and a couple adjacent streets went out for about ten seconds. i wanted to report this light phenomena to see if anyone in the bay area had a similar experience or an explanation for what i saw."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"Glow in clouds with no associated sound followed by street lights going out","City":"Mountain View","Log Number":"US-01272008-0008","Object Shape":"Sphere, Other, Unknown","Case Number":"9291","Latitude":"37.393032","Date Submitted":"01/27/2008 02:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-122.082581","Date of the Event":"01/27/2008 02:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.393032,+-122.082581(9291)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9291) map </A>","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Windy, Rain","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Mountain View","There were no other sightings in Mountain View on or around January 27th 2008"],"Country":"United States","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9291.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9291.html"]}
