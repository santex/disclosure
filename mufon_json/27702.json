The sky was active with multiple starlike objects. Two had been observed flying toward each other but not on a collision course. Many of the other starlike objects had been going almost directly West, East, etc. Like they were following a grid. It appeared that jet aircraft had been regularly patrolling the skies. A few looked like they were getting a closer look at me. I had cameras with me but didn't feel the need to record anything. I am however investing in a pair of night vision binoculars soon to record the night sky. It will surely come in handy... Further down investment for my UFO research is a device that monitors the electromagnetic spektrum and EMF radiation."],"Date Submitted":"02/06/2011 06:40 UTC","Date of the Event":"02/02/2011 07:35 UTC","Log Number":"CA-02062011-0010","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"50.394603","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Moose Jaw","There was one other sighting in Moose Jaw on or around February 2nd 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"Moose Jaw","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-105.548694","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Saskatchewan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.394603,+-105.548694(27702)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27702) map </A>"}
