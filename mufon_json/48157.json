After the first sighting, we noticed military helicopters flying over every day, this is not usual at all. The most prominent sighting we witnessed a helicopter flying low chasing(or possibly escorting) a star-like object, no illusion. We do our own studies on this stuff but the strange thing is we don't try to see things it just happens. We haven't had a sighting in a while until this one, which technically wasn't a sighting. We were on the balcony and we heard a military helicopter going over our building from behind, we stood up to see what it was doing and right when it flew over both of our eyes started to burn, and become watery. It almost felt like a really bright light, but there was none. I hope were not the only ones wondering about these helicopters and what they're doing."],"City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/14/2013 10:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"35.769283","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48157.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48157.html"],"Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06162013-0001","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Case Number":"48157"}
