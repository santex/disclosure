It was an intense white and at a high altitude. As it passed overhead it began to fade out as if the rising sun was the source of the light. At about 75 degrees west north west it faded out. It took about 5 seconds from first spot until total fade out. No other light source was seen. I assume that it could be a satellite, but I normally do not see them at this time of the morning or moving from east to west. Sky was clear. Cloud cover had just broken up about an hour before. Moon was almost full to the south just above the horizon."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Alabaster","Region":"Alabama","Latitude":"33.206133","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27944.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27944.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/22/2011 05:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Bright object traveling at high altitude and speed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.206133,+-86.852957(27944)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27944) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.852957"}
