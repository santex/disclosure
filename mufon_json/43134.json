Sighting occurred when coming around the bend by Westside Drive. Sighting was very short, about 10 to 15 seconds. --- I noticed a very reflective oval in the late afternoon sky, slightly on my right. My first thought was an awfully reflective airplane, but it did not appear to move at all, and it wasn't the correct shape for a plane. My second thought was that I should just keep my eye on it. While I was driving, I passed trees that obscured it momentarily, so it seemed lower to the horizon. It was not 'above me.' I attempted to keep my eye on it as long as I could, while also staying in the flow of the (light) traffic. I was interested in what it might be, (airplane, weather balloon, ufo...) and I was kind of hoping it would do something! But it stayed still, and I went on to my appointment still curious, but not perturbed. When I rounded the bend on Front St. past Hobart St., I lost sight of the object. ---"],"Date of the Event":"08/20/2012 04:40 UTC","Summary":"Silver oval, did not appear to move, extremely reflective surface.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43134.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43134.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.976087,+-70.967315(43134)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43134) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-10102012-0011","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Case Number":"43134","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Exeter","There were no other sightings in Exeter on or around August 20th 2012"]}
