The object came from a NNE direction and I assumed it was a helicopter, but I noticed it had no strobes, made no sound, and it was the strangest color blue I've ever seen. All at once it flickered and changed direction and appeared to be flying straight up towards the stars, and since it was a nice clear night I was able to watch the object fade as if it were leaving the atmosphere, and within 15 seconds of the directional change it was gone. After the sighting I was in awe and disbelief, until I called my mother in the morning and she started telling me about a seeing a big blue star above her house that flashed and disappeared. Oddly enough her sighting was around 10:45pm, and she lives 5 miles and to the north of my sighting."],"City":"Louisville","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Louisville","There were no other sightings in Louisville on or around June 13th 2012"],"Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39348.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39348.html"],"Latitude":"38.287534","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.287534,+-85.579166(39348)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39348) map </A>"}
