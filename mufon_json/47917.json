At first I thought wow that's a bright planet or something then noticed it was moving across the sky. I opened the door and yelled at my wife to come out and look at this. She said the same thing it was not like any plane she had ever seen. I watched it for about two minutes or so total until I lost sight behind my neighbors house. I then ran to the other side of my yard to see if I could get a look at it again. I could not see it, but noticed straight out in front of me there was another large red light. It was moving from right to left across the sky. I called my wife over. Her first words was how did it get over here. I believe it was a different object. It then stopped, and we watched it for a couple minutes. It still appeared bright then it just disappeared."]}
