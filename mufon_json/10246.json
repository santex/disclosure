{"Summary":"very slow falling, flaming, glowing thing making no sound and no smoke trail","Object Shape":"Fireball","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/08/2008 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","divs":["sighting detailsmy son was at home and he went outside to take the dogs out and noticed something very large and flaming coming down toward the earth. he ran inside to get the camcorder and filmed this thing coming down. it seemed like it was falling fast at first like a meteor but then it slowed almost to a stop but it appeared to be flaming the whole time. he filmed it until it dropped down below the tree line of the house. you can see that inside the flames there is something in there but we can't make out what it is other than something pretty large. there was absolutely no smoke or any kind of trail behind it. my son got the whole thing on film and it's a pretty good quality. it was still light outside so you can see it and he filmed it until it dissapeared behind the tree line. it was moving so slow it was hard for me to tell it was still moving. we were all just amazed and we kinda half wondered\\kidded if there wouldn't be some kind of explosion or something as it made it's way down. i'm sorry this camera is not digital and i don't know how to upload the video but i'd be happy to share it if i knew how. i would like someone that might know something of this sort of thing to have a look at it if you have anyone that might be close by in our area."],"Log Number":"US-04102008-0019","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/08/2008 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"31.346563","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10246.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10246.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10246.html"],"Longitude":"-89.26006","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"10246","Region":"Mississippi","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.346563,+-89.26006(10246)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10246) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Petal","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Petal","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
