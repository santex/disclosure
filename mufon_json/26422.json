(he didn���t see it until it was going off into the distance.) i said that ���was definitely no airplane.��� this second encounter lasted until 6:37p.m., so it was three minutes long. this second encounter took place on porto alegre street, and again the object continued moving in the same direction until it got past the river, where it ascended up and disappeared into the sky. a girl walking a ways behind me during the first incident didn���t bother looking up because she thought it was a helicopter and was busy texting, and was shocked when i told her what i saw. i was kind of angry that she hadn���t looked up and i was the only one that saw this the first time, but i extremely glad that someone else saw it the second time to prove that i wasn���t the only person that saw it. by the way, the iupui campus apartments are near the ronald mcdonald house, which is not far from the hospital. this area is extremely easy to find on google maps, however, for some reason it doesn���t show porto alegre, but the street that the ufo went across to get to the river is white river pkwy e. dr."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.776466,+-86.157064(26422)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26422) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"26422","Object Features":"Dome, Insignia","Region":"Indiana"}
