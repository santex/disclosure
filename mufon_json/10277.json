I tried to impose the object using Microsoft Paint that I saw to see if I could get a better view. When I copied it to paint it looked like squares, but when I put it back on Microsoft Word it looked like a clear picture. I was at a July 4 event looking up at the sky and saw a light I thought was a star before a fireworks show was supposed to start. I noticed what look like lights circling on the outside, but wasn't for sure so I thought I would take pictures and try to keep the camera as still as I could to see if I could make out a satellite or something. I think I took the pictures in order for some seconds a a couple of minutes. In some of the pictures it looks like the object changes shape and I don't remember noticing this when I was looking at it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.918254,+-96.634523(10277)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10277) map </A>","Latitude":"32.918254","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10277.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10277.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10277.html"],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","City":"Garland","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","Longitude":"-96.634523","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"New Document with same pictures of July 4 Event."}
