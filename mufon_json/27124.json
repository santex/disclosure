My father and I were accompanied by an entire tour group and snapping photos of the ruins and surrounding areas, in all we caught five unidentified flying objects above the ruins between both of our cameras that day. These are unedited, raw photos. The tour was not the only one that day, yet no one seemed to notice any of the shapes in the sky. It was only now, a week later, after going through the photos that we see these objects. In the first, the object is easily identified,just to the right of the face, and in the second, it is just off to the left of the building."],"Log Number":"MX-12262010-0015","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Quintana Roo"}
