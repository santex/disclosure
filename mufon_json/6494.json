All of us saw the light (we were 5). The light was too high to be an helicopter and too low to be a satelite. The most strange thing was that it did not had any strobe light and that suddenly it disapeared from our sight."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"PR-03042007-0006","Case Number":"6494","Country":"Puerto Rico","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"03/03/2007 07:15 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:01:02","Tags":"City"}
