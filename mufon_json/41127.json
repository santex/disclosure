I was looking up at the sky when I saw lights almost directly above me moving quickly across the sky traveling 3 wide. At first I thought it was a meteorite that broke into pieces. They moved much quicker than a satellite or plane would but slower than other meteorites I've seen. The one in the middle appeared to take the lead and the other 2 lights moved closer together and in behind the lead light forming a triangle. Once the triangle was formed the lights appeared to speed up until I lost them behind the tree line. They kept on a straight line across the sky with no abrupt movements or changes of diretion. They left no trail behind them and did not get any brighter or dimmer. Have never seen anything like that before and it left me with a strange feeling.
