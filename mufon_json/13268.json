{"Latitude":"29.456048","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe (my wife and I) were outside when a commercial jet flying overhead drew our attention. We noticed another object in the vicinity, but lower and slower than the airliner. The airliner had left our field of view by this time. Object was cylindrical, blunt on both ends and what caught our eye was that it had no wings or fins. It was white with a large red stripe around its' midsection. Again, NO sound. By the time I went inside and got my camera, this pic was all I could get. It appeared \"floating\" mmore than under power, and we watched until we couldn't see it anymore. We were somewhat puzzled and skeptical about the odd shape, NO wings and NO noise. Date stamp on photo is correct, but the time appears to be incorrect as it was bright and sunny."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"13268","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Commercial jet overhead drew our attention, saw cylinder nearby","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.456048,+-96.390025(13268)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13268) map </A>","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-10272008-0026","Date of the Event":"11/11/2002 06:37 UTC","City":"Garwood","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13268.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13268_submitter_file1__PB115298.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13268.html"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-96.390025","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Garwood","There was one other sighting in Garwood on or around November 11th 2002","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date Submitted":"11/11/2002 06:37 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder"}
