{"divs":["sighting detailsdear sir,madame, i taught of sending you the following this afternoon about what i saw this morning over the hamrun(city)in country(malta) sky and after i searched for a ufo agency website to where i can send this info,besides mufor here in malta. it was between 12:25-13:30 today afternoon wednesday 04,2007,i think when i was driving my car to the way down to st.gaetan church in st.joseph street hamrun(city) when i noticed a very small silver shining disc shaped flat object very very high altitude almost over the coppola of st.gaetan church. the object was turning upside down in intervals and like in slow motion,floating kind of way and maybe in angles(left)at the same point as well.i could see the below surface was more plain,flat when it angled in this position. at times the object was getting smaller \\fading and then appearing better again. i was of course getting more serious and excited for myself that after seeing that it was not an airplane,i was therefore witnessing a ufo. i did not carry a camera but,i am sure it was not an airplaine. i taught even to myself to evaluate other reasons, that it could be a ballon silver went loose,but i do not think so as it was more like an object doing some sort of manouvers as i explained above,almost the same.. i drived my car more ahead at blata l-bajda forward ahead the street to catch this view better but i could not see it again.i went back to the original position where i was first and i did not see it again.that was the end of it! so,i taught i would inform you about this and maybe you want to check with the radar stations at this hour and location if something appeared or not on their machines.however i saw something this afternoon wich resembles as a ufo. thank you and i hope more info will come about this event..."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"ÃÂ¦amrun","Case Number":"7358","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ħamrun","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere, Other","Longitude":"14.489444","Region":"","Log Number":"MT-07042007-0003","Date of the Event":"07/04/2007 12:46 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.886111","Country":"Malta","Summary":"SILVER DISC SHAPED OBJECT FLIPPING /FLOATING UPSIDE DOWN .FADING AND REAPPERAING AGAIN AT THE SAME POINT.MAYBE MOVED FROM WHEN I DRIVED AHEAD.BUT NOT IN FRONT OF MY EYES.I SAW IT AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION.SAME SKY AREA.","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.886111,+14.489444(7358)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7358) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/04/2007 12:46 UTC","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7358.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7358.html"]}
