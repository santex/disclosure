I asked my husband to look and keep his eyes on it while I got the video camera and tripod. We called the kids to look and had them get their aunt and uncle outside to look. 7 witnesses all together. It was to the east (the 70 degree mark on the compass) and about 75 degrees up. It hovered and kind of stretched like it was going to change shape and after about 4 minutes it faded or blinked out and we couldn���t see it with our eyes any longer. When we watched it on tv later, we saw that it was still there but not bright and hard to see. The weather was warm, upper 80's, no clouds in the immediate area, winds coming from the west. I will put the video on disc and mail it in because the file is going to be really big."],"Region":"Oregon","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Prospect","There were no other sightings in Prospect on or around June 19th 2007"],"Longitude":"-122.487287","Log Number":"US-06192007-0016","Date Submitted":"06/19/2007 05:47 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light"}
