I leaned back in chair and looked up at the sky when I saw what I thought to be just a satelite shooting across night sky. After closer examination I noticed object was closer than that of a satelite. It was a dark(\"shadowy\" like)rounded triangular shape with pinkish orange aura around it. It was traveling at what I figured to be a high rate of speed South to North direction in Port St. Lucie, Fl. The entire incident lasted only 10 to 15 seconds. In this timespan I asked my wife,\"what is that?\". She replied,\"oh my gosh!\" and asked are friends if they could see it. They agreed that they could see it as it flew out of view behind trees. We all were excited but calm and believed we had seen a UFO. We talked briefly of what had happened and what we should do. I decided to report it and came across MUFON on internet."],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-80.35375","Source":"MUFON"}
