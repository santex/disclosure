When, something in my peripheral catches my attention. I was watching a star, slowly move across the sky! I watched very closely so I wouldn't lose the UFO among the other stars. It then made one very abrupt direction change, but continued on it's same course across the sky. At that very instant I knew it wasn't an air plane. In fact, I spotted at least 4 planes during the UFO sighting. I recognized that this UFO was way beyond normal altitude for our planes. It was literally, as if a star, a normal star, was moving with intelligence across the sky. I called my mother to tell her what I saw. She tried to say I must have seen a plane. After getting off the phone, I see ANOTHER one. same deal, except this one does not make any abrupt changes in it's flight pattern. It does however look exactly like the other UFO and stars in the sky."],"Case Number":"37556","Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.658446","Summary":"JUST like a star...except it was moving.
