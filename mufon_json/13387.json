I know the exact date as this was my Mom���s birthday and I am sure of the time because I had just gotten off of the phone with my wife when I noticed a bright orange glow about the size of a basketball Due South from my location over the Cape Fear river. This object was visible for approx. 45 seconds to a minute. I didn���t think too much about it at this time as I did not see it when it first became visible as I just looked up & it was there. I watched the object until it just disappeared. It did not move away, it just disappeared as if someone had cut off a light switch. Approx. 5 minutes later, I was watching in the general direction as where I first saw the object, just as if someone had turned a switch back on, this time I saw it as it appeared. The wind was blowing and the object did not move or sway at all as it would if it were a flare. I am at the point where the Cape Fear river meets the Atlantic ocean, so to be sure it was not a boat in trouble, I went upon a tug boat that was moored at my location and climbed the ladder to the top wheel house as to have an unobstructed view of the river and the surrounding area, during this time the sphere is still visible and again not moving or making any sound. As I watched the object, it split into two (2) more spheres for a total of three now visible. I was watching as the two other objects became visible and at no time did I see sparks or a tail as is present when a flare is fired. In fact, there were no boats present during this sighting, as I had a clear view of the entire area. Again the objects were visible for about 5 minutes, then again, they just disappeared. This went on until about 11:00 P.M. Since this first sighting, I have observed these objects at least 20 different times, never in the same place as they always appear in a different place over the river. Sometimes low, sometimes high in the sky. I did at one time have a night vision scope with me & observed these objects through the scope & at no time did the scope pick up a heat signal as would be present if the object gave off heat as with a flare. I have observed these objects as close as 50 yards, and as far away as a mile. I have observed these objects on clear nights with stars present, & I have seen them on cloudy nights. I have observed them on calm nights as well as very windy nights, but never on a rainy night. I have observed these object by myself, as well as with other witnesses. All the people that were present will tell you the same story as I have related to you. I have myself observed swamp gas & have fired flares, these were neither. I have several telescopes & am familiar with the stars & planets, again these objects are neither. The last time that I observed these objects was in June of 2008. This was the last time that I was near the river at night. If you would like to interview me or any of the other witnesses, I am a retired Police Officer and I am available most anytime. We even can have access to the very places that I have observed these objects. As I have stated, I am a retired Police Officer & everything I have told you is the truth & I would even be willing to take any test that you deem necessary to validate what I have related to you."],"Summary":"Bright orange light that multiplied into 3 separate spheres","Longitude":"-78.020268","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO"}
