{"Longitude":"-75.323799","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside for a smoke and just happened to look up. There was a very shiney object spinning moving north to south. I am close to the Philadelphia airport and I could see several aircraft in the sky and could easily see that this object was much higher. I could tell it was spinning because the way the sun would bounce of it in an interupted way. It was spinning. The revolutions were uniform as in revolving about every 2 seconds. I thought it might be a weather balloon but I am not sure if weather balloons spin. I lost sight of the ogject after 30 or 40 seconds due to some large white clouds in the sky. I of course also thought that either its a ufo or I am seeing a satalite in broad daylight due to the sunshine. I would love to know what I saw."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Ridley Park","There were no other sightings in Ridley Park on or around July 28th 2005"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date Submitted":"07/28/2005 11:35 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Ridley Park","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.881224,+-75.323799(3634)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3634) map </A>","Latitude":"39.881224","Case Number":"3634","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Windy","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-07282005-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3634.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3634.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/28/2005 11:35 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Tags":"City","Summary":"round, shiney, rotating, aprox 40,000 ft, moving south, possible aluminum coated weather balloon, not sure","Sighting Duration":"00:00:40","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
