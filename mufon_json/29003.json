{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-81.092724","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband called out for me and my children to hurry outside. He was downstairs in the driveway. Our driveway and home face a marshfront. On the other side of the marsh is the island of Tybee and then the Atlantic Ocean. The Savannah River Inlet is to our left. There was a Coast Guard helicopter with the spotlight pointing down into the river so my automatic reaction was to look there. My husband said, \"no, over there.\" To the right was this ball of light. It looked like it was very low in the sky and coming right toward our home. We sat there in silence, looking for blinking lights. We did not see any. It suddenly stopped, and looked to move in the opposite direction, due East, straight out to sea. It was out of sight by the time I could count one one thousand!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29003.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29003.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.088541,+-81.092724(29003)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29003) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"05/08/2011 09:40 UTC","Date of the Event":"05/06/2011 08:30 UTC","Case Number":"29003","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","City":"Savannah","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"32.088541","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-05082011-0003","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Ball of light, low over the ocean","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Savannah","There were no other sightings in Savannah on or around May 6th 2011"],"Region":"Georgia"}
