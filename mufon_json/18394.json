We looked over to left where their house is and saw a bright light hovering near their tree line, thinking it was a helicopter. We made a left onto their road and saw a car with their brake lights on in the middle of the road. Made another left into their drive way and this object flew over my vehicle and proceeded in front of the house so quick then disappeared. It was very low, we saw roundness with a red, green, and a blue light. It flew straight across their yard and there was no sound. We did not see any wings or tail so I know it was not an airplane or helicopter. Something flying that low and we saw no neighbors outside. It actually gave us chills."],"trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Greensburg","There were no other sightings in Greensburg on or around July 28th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-07292009-0021","Date of the Event":"07/28/2009 09:25 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18394","City":"Greensburg","Longitude":"-79.529849","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18394.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18394.html"],"Summary":"While driving down the road to our left we saw a bright white light hovering very low near the trees, When we got up on it it flew so quick, we seen roundness and red, green, and blue lights.","Disposition":"Unknown"}
