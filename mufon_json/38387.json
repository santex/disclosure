{"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Oval","Summary":"grey/silver oval shaped flying object flying a little over tree level","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Clifton","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn May 21, 2012, while driving in Clifton, NJ, I was distracted by an image on an oil truck driving ahead of me. I was able to get a quick picture of it as I was driving. After observing the picture later in the day I noticed something in the top corner of the shot. It looked like an oval shape that didn���t seem to be any type of familiar object. After zooming in to get a better look, it occurred that the object looked similar to a UFO. After viewing the picture a few times I was unable to come to any other conclusion. I believe I captured the image of a UFO passing over RT 3 in Clifton, NJ. I returned to the site several hours later to see if the object was still there but it was gone."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-05222012-0025","Region":"New Jersey","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.866983,+-74.157215(38387)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38387) map </A>","Case Number":"38387","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/21/2012 08:15 UTC","Date Submitted":"05/22/2012 10:04 UTC","Latitude":"40.866983","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38387.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/38387_submitter_file1__securedownload12.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/38387_submitter_file2__securedownload1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38387.html"],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Clifton","There was one other sighting in Clifton on or around May 21st 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Longitude":"-74.157215"}
