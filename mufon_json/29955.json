They all appeared from nowhere then flew directly over us starting from very far away coming towards us. All started out as a red ball of light. Sometimes flickering, usually solid. Some faded before they got to us, but most just stayed red. All flying very slow, & did not make any noise. The last one, the red light faded just as it flew above us and I clearly saw that it was a white disk because the Jewel parking lot light by us reflected up to the bottom of it. .NO doubt in my mind it was not a plane or helicopter.That makes it a UFO to me. I only had the camera on my phone and the pictures came out too dark to see anything. Not worth uploading to the sight but I feel the need to tell someone about it. I see a few YouTube videos from tongiht with the same thing. My view was much better than these videos, but it seems people are seeing this in Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois tonight from what I saw uploaded to You Tube. I am a believer after tonight."],"Latitude":"40.634695","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":[],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-89.393508","Object Shape":"Disc","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29955.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29955.html"]}
