From Bernal Heights, it appears over Diamond Heights to the west. The light is bright enough to see with the naked eye. A 2nd light joins (chases?) the first and then the two lights move in a fast west and vertically high direction very quickly. The molecules in the sky appear suddenly very excited as if there were a cloud of energy, that was barely visable. The movement of the lights did not appear to be a GPS tracking satellite, as there was much changing of direction and the disappearing act as mentioned."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.780441,+-119.416732(23792)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23792) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"06/16/2010 06:29 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"36.780441","Log Number":"US-06162010-0013"}
