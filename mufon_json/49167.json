{"Case Number":"49167","divs":["Sighting DetailsAround 9:30 PM EST, I was rolling a garbage can to the curb when I noticed a very bright light or object in the western sky. As soon as the garbage can was in place, I ran inside to get a very cheap pair of binoculars. They were free at a car dealership, but they are far superior to the naked eye. In the few moments it took me to retrieve the binoculars, the object had crossed the sky and was now further north. I am a sky watcher (have seen quite a few anomalies over the past year or two)so I got a chair and braved the mosquitoes in order to observe the unusual object. I kept a close eye on the object for 50 minutes and saw it slowly descend behind a house and trees. The object was pretty far away, but I noticed that it was chevron-shaped and had at least one red light along with several white lights. The lights occasionally pulsated and seemed to start to fade toward the end of my observation. I last observed the object around 10:10 PM EST in the northwest sky."],"Longitude":"-84.4577","City":"Fort Thomas","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Kentucky","Object Shape":"Chevron","Date of the Event":"07/24/2013 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49167.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49167.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07242013-0025","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.109124,+-84.4577(49167)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49167) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Fort Thomas","There were no other sightings in Fort Thomas on or around July 24th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"07/24/2013 11:20 UTC","Summary":"Observed chevron-shaped object in partly cloudy night sky in Northern Kentucky","Latitude":"39.109124"}
