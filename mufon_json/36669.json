On the way home from a friends house, He was driving. I noticed the object in the sky because I seen a noticeable vertical rainbow reflecting off of it. The object was slowly moving towards the sun that was setting(just outside of the picture). I had my friend pull over and we both got out of the car and he took 2 pictures one normal picture and a zoomed up picture of it. I was astonished. It was so beautiful I could not take my eyes off of it. I had a calm feeling, I was not scared or frightened. It was purely gorgeous. We watched the object for about 15 minutes as it was still very slowly heading towards the sun. I watched it as we drove away."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.260023,+-95.995028(36669)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36669) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Omaha","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
