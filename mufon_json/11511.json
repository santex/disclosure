It was daytime, mabey 1pm. I was on the cell phone trying to find his exact location and we came up to an street intersection. I looked up mabey 75-100 feet above the stop lights to see a hovering craft that was spinning and wobbling. My son was looking at it too! I told my friend on the phone what we were seeing. He laughed at me. I'm surprised no cars were pulling over. Everyone was ignoring it and going on with there business. I had to turn left at the light, so I lost it. My son said it took off really fast! It really did look fake like the old 1950's UFO photo's that you see. But it was not fake. It was metal, I don't remember it being shiny though, it was dull like an old pie tin I guess. My son drew a picture of what he saw. His eyes are much better than mine and he actually saw the port holes on the thing. I tried to call the police that evening to report it, but they didnt really care. At arms length it was the size of a football."],"Region":"Utah","Case Number":"11511","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11511.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11511.html"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Patterned Surface","Tags":"City","trends":[],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.32415,+-111.090821(11511)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11511) map </A>","Longitude":"-111.090821"}
