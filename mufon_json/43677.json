She noticed four lights close together toward the south and commented \"how close those planes are stacked up together. The four lights moved to the north. We saw that three of them in a triangle formation that were solid light lights, and a fourth light lower in altitude, trailing that was white with blinking red and blue lights like a helicopter or plane following the other three. Pulled off the freeway at Greenway road and found a parking lot to get a better look. By that time the lights were all far off to the north and appeared to be in more of a line."],"City":"Phoenix","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43677.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43677.html"],"trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 2 other sightings in Phoenix on or around November 2nd 2012"],"Summary":"Three bright white lights followed by a light with blinking red and blue lights","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Arizona","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"33.457977","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.457977,+-112.064967(43677)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43677) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/03/2012 03:38 UTC","Case Number":"43677","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/02/2012 07:00 UTC","Longitude":"-112.064967"}
