I wanted to take video of it to compare to my last sighting of a triangular object so I began to film it with my SONY HI8 Handi Cam model CCD-TRV65. This object had the identical light pattern as before. 3 dim white lights, one on each 'tip' and a pulsing white light and a pulsing red light. There is one significant difference between this sighting and the others. This time I heard what sounded like jet engines. This object flew at the same slow pace across the sky from West to East as the last one. I have about 3 minutes of video of this sighting and the weird thing is that once it moved closer to the Eastern Horizon it seemed to 'hover' because there was a point where the lights should have been disappearing but they didn't. I dont know how to transfer HI8 video to a PC but I will upload the video ASAP."],"Date of the Event":"06/12/2009 12:47 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.772526,+-116.780882(17438)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17438) map </A>","Latitude":"47.772526","Region":"Idaho","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-116.780882","City":"Hayden","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Hayden","There were 2 other sightings in Hayden on or around June 12th 2009"]}
