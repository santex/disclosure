They are back!! At 6:45 p.m. we saw a single light, smaller than the previous sightings. Then two together. Both were due north, up high. At 7:15 p.m. we saw a strip of lights going north to south. Then the biggie happened! 7 large lights came on one at a time from right to left in a straight line - on, off, on, off - we counted out loud till 7. Nothing since. Wow. Hugh ran to get the camera just in case but we saw no more. We shall keep the camera on the table! Note: report filed by John Fegel, ID#9302. Witnesses request no contacts from MUFON."],"Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"01/26/2010 01:45 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown"}
