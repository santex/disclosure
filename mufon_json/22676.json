He called me and said \"dad come look at this\". I looked out his window to see a VERY large black triangle with white lights at the corners heading west. it appeared to be moving about the same speed as normal aircraft. We do have some clouds in the sky and it was well below the cloud cover. If I had to guess , I would say it was at around a 3,000 ft altitude. I lost sight as it went behind other buildings I did not hear any noise , but my son said he heard a hum (thats what made him look). I am ex-military and a frequent flyer and I have NEVER seen anything this large in the sky."],"Longitude":"-80.266159","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Palm City","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Large Black triangle","Log Number":"US-04062010-0014","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Palm City","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Date of the Event":"04/06/2010 08:55 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.167827,+-80.266159(22676)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22676) map </A>","Latitude":"27.167827"}
