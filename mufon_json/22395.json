(when i was younger, he had told me of a ufo that he and his brothers encountered when they were young.) over the years, i've told the story to a few other relatives and a few friends. i've been aware of mufon since i was a teenager in the 1980s, but i never thought of telling my story to it. i described the aforementioned event to another relative earlier today, and he talked me into submitting it to mufon."]}
