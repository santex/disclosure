They appeared to be hovering over the Willmington Island area, I thought it was strange. I observed them for approximately 10 seconds when they \"disappeared\". About 5 seconds later they reappeared but it was three lights this time, in the same place in the sky, which was a cloudless early evening. They lasted for approximately 10 seconds again when I quickly ran inside to get another witness. When I came back outside, they disappeared again and reappeared, this time it was only one bright red light in the same spot in the sky, and disappeared again after 10 seconds. I never saw the lights again, but I do have one witness that saw the single red light before it disappeared. My reaction was I thought it was very strange, being former military working around aircraft, it was no aircraft and I have no clue what it could have been."],"City":"Savannah","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Savannah","There were no other sightings in Savannah on or around November 15th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"10/21/2013 04:54 UTC","Latitude":"32.092741","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.092741,+-81.097284(51700)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51700) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51700.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51700.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Saw a series (five) of bright red lights for approx 30 seconds","Object Features":"Unknown"}
