I wastraveling Eastbound on Touhy Ave. and I always look up at the planes and I am anavid aviation enthusistsp and have many many years of experience and canidentify most commerical planes in a matter of seconds. What first struck meabout the object was how small it was in comparison to a plane on the 27L flightvector this is the standard course and altitude that the palnse take to land atOHare. It was so small about the size of the tail section of a 747. And what wasmost striking was that it was flying South to North directly over the path ofthe incoming planes....that is what caught my eye. Then after I viewed it withmy mouth open, it literally disappeared. I am a lay expert when it comes toplanes disappearing and reappearing it is a common affect of an airplane againstcertain color skies. This dissappeared on a clear blue day.
