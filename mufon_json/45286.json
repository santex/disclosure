M. standing near our garage, i was talking to a friend and looked up over his shoulder and saw a perfect triangular shape of three lights which were brighter than our Mars or Jupiter. I stopped our conversation and pointed to the lights Within just a few seconds one light went out then around the triangle a second light went out, then the last one too. This whole incident lasted around 15 to 30 seconds. What caught my eye was the bright triangular lights, that were brighter than our planetary lights and in a perfect triangle. We do not have any in the sky! Then to have the lights go out one by one within about 5 seconds. We both looked at each other in amazement. There was no sound. The object itself was not visible with the lights or without the lights. When a jet goes over with the flashing lights on the wings and they are 20,000 feet high, in comparison this UFO was 500 to 1000 feet high, just hovering with no movement and no sound and then disappear it was quite something. This was my first UFO."],"Region":"Michigan","Summary":"3 stationary, triangular bright lightsAfter","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lexington","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"11/16/2012 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
