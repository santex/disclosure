First though about this object- i was observing the stars out my back patio window then this blood red object appeared from the western sky and was headed east slowly now i am not good at telling how high up it was or low all i say is this object was flying low not high and the two big looking red bulbs took turns pulsating back and forth and there was a hint of a white light flashing on the bottom about every ten seconds and this looked bigger then the planes that were flying around this object and there are a lot of planes out tonight i wonder if any of the pilots were close enough in range to see it i sure hope i am not the only one seeing these things there has to be others among the town that are not willing to discuss what they are seeing are afraid to be judged by others by discussing what they saw or people don't know where to report sightings at total time object was in sight was about five minutes"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9560.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9560.html"],"Region":"Iowa","Latitude":"41.879572","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-93.096522","Case Number":"9560","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/12/2008 08:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-02122008-0014","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.879572,+-93.096522(9560)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9560) map </A>"}
