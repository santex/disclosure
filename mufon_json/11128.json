{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was out for a bike ride around 1am this morning and sighted what appeared to be two objects flying next to each other with lights far brighter than any plane in the sky that night.(and yes, there were planes flying at that time to compare it to) Eventually I showed it to my friends and we all came to the conclusion that it was Unidentified. The lights seemed to revolve around the center so I realized it was a your run of the mill saucer shaped craft. It slowly flew south and eventually disappeared far beyond the horizon. This event lasted about 7 minutes. It was very far away yet extremely bright. An amazing sighting indeed."],"Date of the Event":"06/11/2008 01:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/11/2008 01:00 UTC","Case Number":"11128","Summary":"Saw what appeared to be two objects flying perfectly next to each other, once I got a better look I realized the lights were revolving around just one object!","Longitude":"-84.763664","Latitude":"43.605048","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Mt Pleasant","There were no other sightings in Mt Pleasant on or around June 11th 2008"],"Region":"Michigan","City":"Mt Pleasant","Log Number":"US-06112008-0004","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Disc","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11128.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11128.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.605048,+-84.763664(11128)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11128) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
