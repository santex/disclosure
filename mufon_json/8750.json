{"Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","divs":["Sighting Details1. I was a passanger driving down Coit towards I-635. 2. We (me and the driver) both noticed a large glowing orb of light heading the same way as we were parallel to the earths surface about 5-6 hundred feet above the ground. It lite up all the clouds around it with an unexplainable glow as the object then seemed to dissolve into nothing the same way it appeared. 3. My first thought was that it looked like missle the way it was traveling but only for a moment because of the amazing white glow that surrounded it. I knew it wasn't some kind of fire work or flare simply because you could tell it was a rather large object emitting the glow and traveling at a very fast starting and ending in the sky above. 4. It seemed to stay the same distance as the contour of the earth. 5. Frustrated and curious as to what it was. I wanted to talk about it but it's hard to find the words to describe. 6. It disapeared the same way it appeared. It seemed to materialize in and out of sight."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8750.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8750.html"],"Summary":"LARGE GLOWING ORB","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.025093,+-96.695166(8750)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8750) map </A>","Latitude":"33.025093","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-96.695166","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-12312007-0002","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Plano","There were no other sightings in Plano on or around December 29th 2007"],"Date of the Event":"12/29/2007 07:00 UTC","Case Number":"8750","Date Submitted":"12/29/2007 07:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Object Features":"None","Region":"Texas","City":"Plano","Object Shape":"Other","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States"}
