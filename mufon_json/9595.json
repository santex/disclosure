I LOOKED OUTSIDE AND SEEN A FLASHING OBJECT IN THE SKY TO THE SOUTH AND IT WAS JUST SITTING IN ONE SPOT. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A SATILITE IN THE SKY BUT IT WAS FLASHING MULTICOLORED LIGHTS RAPIDLY COLORS OF RED, BLUE, YELLOW, GREEN AND WHITE. IT WAS MILES AWAY FROM ME I COULD NOT ESTIMATE HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS BUT IT WAS JUST IN THE SKY ABOVE THE TREE LINE MAKING IT VISIBLE IN THE SKYLINE. MY WIFE AND SISTER SEEN IT AS WELL I COULD SEE IT THEN STARTED MOVING IN SHORT MOVEMENTS FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND UP AND DOWN. I SNAPED SOME PHOTOS OF IT WITH MY DIGITAL CAMERA AND PUT THEM ON MY COMPUTER TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IT MIGHT BE.I,M STILL NOT SURE WHAT IS OR WAS BECAUSE LATER IT WAS GONE OUT OF SIGHT. BUT MY SISTER INSISTS IT IS A SATILITE. I TOOK THE PHOTO AND ZOOMED IN TO THE OBJECT AND IT IS WHATEVER IT IS?
