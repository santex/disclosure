A YELLOW FIREBALL APPEARED AND GOT LARGER AND LARGER HEADING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. IT TURNED GREEN, THEN ORANGE WITH A BLUISH COLOR AND THEN BLINKED A FEW TIMES BEFORE FIZZING OUT. LOOKED LIKE IT MIDDWAY UP LAKE MOHAVE. 5 MINUTES LATER I FELT A SHOCK WAVE GO BY, THE GROUND AND HOUSE SHOOK A LITTLE, FELT LIKE A SONIC BOOM WITHOUT THE NOISE. THIS WAS THE BIGGEST THING I EVER SEEN BURNING THROUGH THE SKY.
