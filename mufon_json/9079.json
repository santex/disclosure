{"Case Number":"9079","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from a meeting at my school and as I turned on a darker highway a spotted 3 very vivid stationary lights in the east sky. At this time they formed a triangle. I looked closer because they were brighter than any star I'd seen and they formed such a perfect design together. As I continued driving North into Greeley the 3 lights then lined up on top of each other with just a little space in between. I stopped my vehicle and took a picture with my cell phone. There were 2 other vehicles I believe saw them as well because they were pulled over in a driveway looking. I've always been afraid of UFOs but this did not scare me or make me uncomfortable in any way. I continued home looking at them in my rear view mirror. At last look they had separated and formed the original triangular shape I first saw them in. When I looked back one last time before entering city lights they were gone. The shape of the individual light was difficult to see when they were lined up together. When they separated I could see a somewhat diamond shape looking as if there were more than one light on each edge of it."],"Summary":"3 UFO's over LaSalle/Evans/Highway 85 area, CO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9079.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9079.html"],"Log Number":"US-01202008-0013","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/26/2007 08:56 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Diamond, Oval","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/26/2007 08:56 UTC","trends":[],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Colorado","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Longitude":"-105.778837","Latitude":"39.554891","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.554891,+-105.778837(9079)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9079) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
