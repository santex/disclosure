I have driven that stretch 3000 times and that object did not belong there, too big and bright for a star. I pulled over and got out to look, and total time i saw it was maybe 3 minutes. Then it shot out of sight into outerspace, incredible acceleration, no human body could survive that. I saw it go right out of our atmosphere, directly, no vectoring for escape trajectory that our craft need."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28446.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28446.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"28446","Object Shape":"Sphere","Country":"United States","Latitude":"43.238931","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03292011-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.238931,+-86.244212(28446)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28446) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/15/1997 12:00 UTC","Region":"Michigan"}
