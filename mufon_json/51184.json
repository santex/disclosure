{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"09/28/2013 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife called me on balcony of our 11th floor hotel room. We both witnessed an orange almost round object coming towards us. As it got maybe 50 feet away, it went slowly out over the ocean and disappeared. We saw another, what I believed was a helicopter over a pier, and it almost stopped and put on a light to scan the ocean. It hovered, for awhile and then went over the hotel at the end of Myrtle Beach and then picked up speed and we lost sight as it was getting close in distance and height to the hotel about 3 mins away. The first I thought was a toy plane until it disappeared over the ocean. The second appeared to be a helicopter looking for something in the water but was silent and was far too close to the buildings. I watched people on the beach to see reactions because the pier lights and hotel lights lit up the area, but they seemed uninterested so it must have been a toy or something that was explained. I videoed but it did not pick it up well."],"trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Myrtle Beach","There were no other sightings in Myrtle Beach on or around September 28th 2013"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-78.948385","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"51184","Country":"United States","City":"Myrtle Beach","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.633665,+-78.948385(51184)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51184) map </A>","Region":"South Carolina","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-09292013-0025","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.633665","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"One was orange and almost round and came towards us. other like small plane","Date Submitted":"09/29/2013 08:23 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51184.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51184.html"]}
