It seemed to say \"I'm here and I looked way left, a there it was again! I tried to watch and pull off the freeway, and it vanished again, yet toying with me,now I'm over here. Caught it again but while getting ready to pull off to see it better, I lost it. It looked like a metalic tea strainer hanging in the sky then taking off at such a speed I could'nt follow it. Light reflecting off upper part, and black onlower part. Fascinated,and a little scared,trying to make sense of it.Thought it was a helicopter, but it was'nt.Felt it was a ufo, and telepathically wanting me to know it."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:12"}
