(150-200 feet high the object) the object was moving right to left. i first thought the object was an airplane coming from the nearby hickory airport. i did wonder why it was so low and that caught my attention. the object was oblong, oval maybe 100 feet long and bulged in the middle to maybe 30-40 feet at the center. the sun was behind me and glaring off the craft and i thought at first that the sun's glare was hiding the wings. the object was whitish in color but seemed to reflect the sun like metal. i watched it move just over the road i was on i am not sure how far it was ahead of me not more than 1\\4 mile. it then turned and this is when it got interesting. it did not turn the way an airplane turns it pivoted around it's midsection. it got right over the center of the highway then rotated until it was in line with the road. the object was oval from the side but as it turned i could see it was like a sub bun and looked circular from behind. it had no wings at all i could see this clearly now. the back of the craft was the same white metal color but in the center rear of the craft was a black featureless circle. the craft began traveling along above the road slowly at first then all of a sudden it shrank to a black dot and then disappeared as if it shot forward at an impossible speed."],"Case Number":"35354"}
