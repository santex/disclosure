{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI took the dog out for the last time tonite.I was looking at Polaris and out of nowhere saw what appeared to me to be a light streaking across the sky from South to North.It was definately faster than a plane.It was brighter than any shooting star I've EVER seen.And it was also slower than any shooting star I've seen.I was standing on the deck in front of my house and it was nne at approx. a 45-50 deg angle.My first thought was of videos of the Apollo or Shuttle spacecraft returning.My second thought was how much it looked like a rocket going through the sky.I saw no signs of a contrail of any kind."],"Log Number":"US-09012007-0002","Latitude":"40.745317","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/01/2007 11:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date Submitted":"09/01/2007 11:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Monticello","There were no other sightings in Monticello on or around September 1st 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-86.764734","Region":"Indiana","Case Number":"7799","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7799.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7799.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.745317,+-86.764734(7799)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7799) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Monticello","Country":"United States","Summary":"sighting of unknown object"}
