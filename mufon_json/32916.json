{"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsStepped out back door of home to have a smoke. A few stars were visible among the clouds and then I saw 3 white orbs dancing around one another. In relation to visible stars, they were about the same in size. they darted around and at one point two of them apparently merged and that combo got a little bigger. Then they separated. Watched the 3 of them for about eight minutes. No camera available for pix, but doubt they would appear as other than those streaky lights you see on the ufo tv shows anyway. Finished my cigarette and went back in house."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"10/27/2011 11:23 UTC","Latitude":"47.988155","Longitude":"-122.198009","Case Number":"32916","Summary":"3 dancing lights above me","Log Number":"US-10272011-0014","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in Everett","There were no other sightings in Everett on or around October 26th 2011"],"City":"Everett","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.988155,+-122.198009(32916)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32916) map </A>","Date of the Event":"10/26/2011 07:32 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32916.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32916.html"]}
