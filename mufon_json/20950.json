I stepped outside my apartment near Southern ave and Rural road. I took a few pics and videos of objects in the area. I had turned my camera off and was talking to my son when I noticed directly overhead, a bright blue light just hanging there in total silence. It stayed there for a few moments. Long enough for my camera to reboot. I was able to get it on video for a few seconds before it sped off and disapeared."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Tempe","There were no other sightings in Tempe on or around June 24th 2004","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Date of the Event":"06/24/2004 07:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Tempe"}
