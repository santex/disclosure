I live on adjacent mtn and they appeared halfway up mtn at about same elevation as my home and the mtn is less than a half mile away. my family also witnessed this as well as two other people. there wasn't any sound. I witnessed the same kind of lights about 6 or 7 years ago but they formed two triangles instead of vertical lines and seemed to have smaller objects going back and forth between the orange lights. cant explain but I will be definitely be watching that area. didn't get any pictures but after checking the internet there is a lot of pics and videos of what looks to be same things"],"Date Submitted":"07/17/2013 07:38 UTC","Log Number":"US-07172013-0012","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Franklin","There were no other sightings in Franklin on or around July 16th 2013"],"Date of the Event":"07/16/2013 10:27 UTC","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.114311,+-83.439217(49011)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49011) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Franklin","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"49011","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"North Carolina","Latitude":"35.114311","Summary":"they appeared on side of mtn and the moved to center of vally -lined up in rows of three then ascended to 3500 ft ten disappeared one at a time"}
