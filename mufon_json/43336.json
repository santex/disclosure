I was inside at the time and I took some of my Yorkies out to go to the bathroom. I went outside to take them out. 2.I always look up at the sky because there are many times in different places I swear I've seen ufos. 3.Well I knew it had to be a craft of some sort. 4.It was triagular like a triangle. It stayed in one spot for minutes without traveling anywhere else. During the time it was in one part of the sky, it kept on having these strange light formations and patterns that continued. 5. I'm never scared whenever I see a ufo. I'm always curious and always want to more and why always me that sees these things. I'm always strangely happy whenever I see a ufo. 6. I didn't lose sight of it. I just got bored of lkking at it so I went back inside."],"Date of the Event":"10/10/2012 01:07 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/17/2012 07:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Really awesome and mysterious","Latitude":"37.802701","City":"Maize","Region":"Kansas","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Maize","There were no other sightings in Maize on or around October 10th 2012"],"Longitude":"-97.451818","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.802701,+-97.451818(43336)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43336) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43336.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43336.html"],"Log Number":"US-10172012-0022"}
