I guess they are putting on a nice colorful show because of the sighting I had earlier in the day that scared the living crap out of me.. I told \"them\" I would not record them anymore and that, they can't come in the form of \"blackchoppeprs\" because it is too scary especially when flying low. They decided to come in the form of ORBS and entertain, I guess to apologize for the scare.. Look and enjoy.. This is over NYC, Central Park and Mid-town area.... Began around 7:40pm until 9pm. Then it was completely quite the entire night.. 111709 v456"]}
