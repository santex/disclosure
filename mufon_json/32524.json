At first I thought it might be a helicopter although I have never seen one such a bright orange-red or gold-copper color before. It came in our direction and was slowly descending at the same time. As it came closer I realized the white flickering light appeared instead to be a flame. It was not a balloon, though, as the light was in front of the bright sphere, not beneath it. I tried to get my passenger to look at it, but by the time he looked up the view of the sphere was obscured by the roof of my car. There was a plane in the distance, but none near me. I have never seen such a brilliantly glowing sphere before. It looked large, but as I had no real frame of reference, I cannot say the actual size."]}
