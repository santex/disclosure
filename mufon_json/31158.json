(almost \"surreal-looking\") another \"ball-like\" object can be seen above the individuals head when zoomed it. used scanner w\\ 1200 dpi for second photo and only about 600 for the first(which contains both photos). i have decided not to blot out the faces in the photograph to prevent the accusation of tampering. notes: in retrospect i did not feel \"strange\" during this time. why the objects only appear in the photographs i am in is unknown. blots on the emulsion can be most likely ruled out, especially conserning the second photograph in high resolution. anyone attempting to contact me should email me at :ghandivitamine@gmail.com (yes i know its silly) serious individuals only. i will not be interviewed under most circumstances. these photos are the only proof i need.feel free to discuss your opinion on the matter. all matters discussed with me are confidential."],"Tags":"City"}
