I look up and i see this giant flying disk and i had no idea what it was at first but then i realized what it was. there was no doubt in my mind that what i saw was a definite u.f.o. This thing was at least the size of a football stadium. It was circular and it was black and grey and the sun was reflecting off of the top from what i could see. It had no shadow and it made no noise. The first time i saw it. It rose up from behind the hill and hovered there for about ten seconds then it shot up in the sky like a bullet and vanished. when i saw the thing i was in shock and i was very exited. I was driving home and i saw it the second time and it was doing the same thing but it was further away and that's when i snapped the picture."],"Longitude":"-75.936027","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Disc","City":"Binghamton","Sighting Duration":"00:20:00","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Binghamton","There was one other sighting in Binghamton on or around August 1st 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.092072,+-75.936027(30563)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30563) map </A>","Case Number":"30563","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
