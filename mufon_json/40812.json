One friend commented-what is that? She pointed to an orange ball of light traveling parallel with the tree line from right to left. We watched it continue its path-conjecturing as to what it could be-no blinking lights like an airplane-perhaps a helicopter? Couldn't hear any sound. Once it reached our far left-it disappeared into a pinpoint of orange. The friend that spotted it at first explained how she thought it was a firework @ first because of the way it ascended & then she waited for it to explode but it didn't. It just kept traveling across the sky."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Hanover Park","There were no other sightings in Hanover Park on or around July 14th 2012"],"Log Number":"US-07152012-0003","Date Submitted":"07/15/2012 01:43 UTC","Region":"Illinois","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Fireball","Date of the Event":"07/14/2012 10:05 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40812.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40812.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-88.137429","Country":"United States","City":"Hanover Park","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.949335"}
