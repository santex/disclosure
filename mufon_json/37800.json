I also notice the sun was surrounded by pinkish red petals of light like flower petals. I took some videos too & saw this disc darting to and from towards the sun with a trail of light always behind it. the center was bright blue & outer edges were violet purple, I thought it may be a lens flare from my camera but I was using my cell phone which is 8 megapixels so I don't know if that would happen, in a few pics the orbs varied from bright white to transparent & there were many of them at same time. I just felt a sense of a presence in the sky around me."],"Log Number":"US-04282012-0005","Latitude":"37.039209","Date Submitted":"04/28/2012 02:08 UTC","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cylinder, Disc, Fireball, Sphere, Other","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/25/2012 01:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"disc shaped purple sphere of light on outer side neon blue circle in center yellow orange to gold emission","Case Number":"37800","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Hampton","There were no other sightings in Hampton on or around April 25th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering"}
