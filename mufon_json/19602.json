{"Date of the Event":"09/12/2009 12:00 UTC","City":"Twisp","divs":["Sighting DetailsHiking the high range of the Sawtooth mountains west of Twisp WA. we approached a pass just below 8,000'. I stopped to take some pictures of my companions from the top as they summited this pass. All five of us saw nothing unusual. My camera got wet on the hike out so I didn't turn it on to download my images for many days so I could make sure it was dry so I only saw the images a few days ago. Previewing my images I saw something in one shot over the far ridge that was out of place, zoomed up on it and WOW, what looks to me to be a UFO. I���ve been looking and waiting to see a real ufo myself my entire 55 years, this is a first for me. Images taken before and after of the same view show nothing. I am a Photographer and use Photoshop allot and I know imaging, but I haven���t messed with this image at all other than to zoom up and clip out the UFO section and enhanced the resolution a little, also made a negative out of one of the clips to get and different look. Looking closer I became more convinced it was something out there in the sun and was 3 dimensional, not on my lens or a digital blurb. The mid day sun was high behind my left shoulder about 15-20 degrees and looking at the clip the object seems to have highlights and shadows matching the sun's position. It also has what seems to be a dark band around it's middle and a light area (aura if you will) around it, especially under it. Watching UFO hunters last night online I saw an old sketch made in 1977 of a UFO spotted in Brazil, it has many similarities to the one in my image. I have included a screen snap of the sketch. Let me know what you think, am I off track here or do I have a UFO image?
