We decided to take a break and lie down on the pavement to stargaze. That's when we observed the moving white light in the sky. It could be mistaken for an immensely bright star at first sight, but it was moving and we had compared it to a plane which was flying near it - There was clearly a difference. The UFO was flying in one direction and whipped around coming back towards us. It was when it was stationary above us that I could see upon closer inspection that it in fact had three lights on the UFO forming a triangle. It had stayed stationary for a few minutes and then flew into the clouds. o o o The lights looked something like that ^ I hope this was a clear enough description. ^-^"],"Country":"Canada","Summary":"Observed a moving light in the sky above the park.","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"48213","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48213.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48213.html"],"Longitude":"-76.511002","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.234732,+-76.511002(48213)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48213) map </A>","Latitude":"44.234732","Log Number":"CA-06182013-0004"}
