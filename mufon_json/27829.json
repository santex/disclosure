After feasting i put my wetsuit back on and started paddling out and saw a huge fireball shaped thingy go over my bros. I thought it was an asteroid or somthing at first, we all did. They freaked and went under water, but i was far enough away to be chill. i watched it and it almost came to a complete stop, about triple over-head, then went away. Nobody got abducted or anything, it was just wierd. after a while it just went away and we went inside and made digiorno pizza while we played Cod. weve gone out with cameras the last few days trying to find it again but weve got nothing. i was hoping one of you guys could help."],"Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.287732"}
