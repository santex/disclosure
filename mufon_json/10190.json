{"Longitude":"-75.154919","divs":["Sighting DetailsiT was between 1am and 1:15 am on the morning of April 7th, 2008. I was in my car driving around the neighborhood looking for my cat. I saw a red light about the size of two quarters behind the trees and it was movng. It pulsed. I was curious and followed it to get a closer look. It crossed over rt 309 over behind Walmart and then I couldn't follow it anymore as the road ended and it eventually was out of site. It had a really bright big red light and some smaller white lights and some other colors - couldn't tell exactly what the other colors were as it moved quickly and the I lost site of it. It was pretty low as it appeared to be behind trees. The red light pulsed and the other lights twinkled and changed color rapidly."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:04:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10190.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10190.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10190.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Hoax","Region":"Pennsylvania","Latitude":"39.953815","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Big red light with small white and some other color seen moving across sky","Date of the Event":"04/07/2008 01:10 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/07/2008 01:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There was one other sighting in Philadelphia on or around April 7th 2008"],"Case Number":"10190","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-04072008-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.953815,+-75.154919(10190)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10190) map </A>","Country":"United States","City":"Philadelphia","Source":"MUFON"}
