It quickly continued straight down, or away, for a duration shorter than 3 seconds (approx) and appeared to \"burn out\" as an ember would from a BBQ fire. It was a straight line. Conditions are cloudy, overcast, with \"fuzzy sky\" but clear near the surface. Initial Thoughts: Thought for a moment it was a low flying plane... After Thoughts: Perhaps it was a meteor... Conclusion: Reported to substantiate any additional reports only. Not enough information alone... Location: McCowan & Hwy 401 in Scarborough (community within Toronto) Ontario Canada. Viewed from 23rd floor of Apt building to the NE of the apparent \"light source\"."],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.782009,+-79.255409(9931)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9931) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/14/2008 01:20 UTC","Latitude":"43.782009","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"Firework or flare residue","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9931.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9931.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
