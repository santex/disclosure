{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife was a passenger as my daughter was driving. In an open field on my wife's side,(North to Northeast), my wife noticed 3 bright white lights in triangle formation, 100 yards from her hovering taller than tree top. She saw no visible object because it was dark. One by one the lights turned off and one by one the lights came back on. They did not blink or flash on and off like a typical aircraft. Today, 9-29-2013, 1:30p.m. eastern time, my wife went back by the same area to pick up my daughter and told me there were no structures in the field. My wife was really awestruck while telling me what she saw."],"Log Number":"US-09292013-0019","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51176.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51176.html"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Clinton","There were no other sightings in Clinton on or around September 28th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Summary":"Driving by open field.","Region":"Maine","City":"Clinton","Longitude":"-69.500127","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.645858,+-69.500127(51176)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51176) map </A>","Case Number":"51176","Date of the Event":"09/28/2013 07:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"44.645858","Date Submitted":"09/29/2013 03:23 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
