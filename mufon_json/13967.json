I immediately noticed a very bright and somewhat distant l Ball of light slowly moving in the sky. For the first few seconds, I dismissed it, it resembled a meteor or \"shooting star\". There were no audible frequencies emitted. Then the object began to stutter around in a relatively small radius from my perspective. After about a minute the ball of light just sped off into space at a very accute angle. I would estimate the object accelerated from 0 to several thousend miles per hour in less than half a second. I remember thinking \"finally I have seen one\". If only it were closer to me I may have been able to make out it's color. It emitted a similar wavelength of light similar to a Xenon headlight of a bmw. Very beautiful."],"Object Features":"None"}
