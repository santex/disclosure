Went outside and saw a red glowing object falling towards the ground. We discussed it and thought it might be a large lantern. Then about 4 minutes later I saw another (parachute with a red glow in the middle) above us falling and getting smaller and further away, and then another few minutes went past and we saw another and then another. We could not see any landing, as after a while they just disappeared. Sat outside for another 10 minutes and didn't see anything else."],"Longitude":"174.770652","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"parachute with red glow x4 in 15 minutes falling towards NE","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/15/2013 06:09 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48963.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48963.html"],"Object Features":"Other","Country":"New Zealand","Case Number":"48963","Date of the Event":"07/15/2013 09:00 UTC","City":"Auckland"}
