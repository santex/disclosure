I live close to Alliance airport and like to see the planes land from my back yard. I watched as what seem to appear to be an airplane coming in from an other than normal flight pattern. The planes that come in to Alliance airport will fly in from the north, northwest and make its landing. What I saw were eight lights coming from the south. There seem to be more lights on this plane, and the lights appeared bigger than a normal plane that would land at this airport. I waited to hear the sound of the plane landing and I didn���t hear anything. I thought it was strange to see so many lights on a plane and to look so perfectly still, I could never really make out a silhouette of a plane because the light were bright, I never saw the plane land, and never heard the plane land, which I always hear, because I am less than a mile away from the airport, before I could make any sense of it, the lights had disappeared."],"Case Number":"20364","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date Submitted":"11/07/2009 07:52 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.090504,+-97.286729(20364)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20364) map </A>","City":"Justin","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20364.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20364.html"]}
