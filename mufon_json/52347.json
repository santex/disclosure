{"Country":"United States","Case Number":"52347","Date Submitted":"11/20/2013 11:29 UTC","Log Number":"US-11202013-0021","divs":["Sighting DetailsTriangle shaped UFO seen over Hatfield PA at 10:58pm flying north west to south west. It was a perfect triangle shape. It had three white lights and one red pulsing red light. All the lights were very bright. one bright white light on each corner of the 'triangle' and one bright red blinking pulsing light in the center of the 'triangle'. the white lights did not blink and were steady. I was surprised how bright the lights were. The object seemed large and low altitude. Since it was night time, this is all I could tell about the object. It looked triangular because of the position of the lights, but I am not sure if it was a different shape because it was dark outside. All I can go by are the lights. It was silent and moved rather slowly and it seemed to be quite low for an airplane. I never saw an airplane like that, but wouldn't rule it out. It was very bright and big and low altitude."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52347.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52347.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-75.285155","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.279515,+-75.285155(52347)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52347) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Hatfield","There were no other sightings in Hatfield on or around November 19th 2013"],"Summary":"Triangle ufo with very bright white lights and one bright pulsating red light in middle over Hatfield PA","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/19/2013 10:56 UTC","Latitude":"40.279515","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","City":"Hatfield","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City"}
