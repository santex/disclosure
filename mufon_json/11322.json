{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside in my backyard when suddenly and quiet unexpected there was a definite feeling of something of size and super fast speed passing overhead; this took me a second or two to realize there had just been something as stated, there was no rushing of wind, no movement of trees HOWEVER my dog reacted also with some degree of delay (a second or two after the thing has passed by) and began barking and circling while looking to my roof. Something unidentified just happened, certainly no airplane, it didn't feel like that at all. I had this vague feeling of this something being round and flat yet I did not see anything -- I felt it pass overhead as stated. Tremendous speed."],"Region":"Maryland","Longitude":"-77.577769","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Waynesboro","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"06/27/2008 07:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11322.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11322.html"],"Case Number":"11322","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"US-06272008-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.755927","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.755927,+-77.577769(11322)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11322) map </A>","Summary":"something of tremendous speed passed over head","Date Submitted":"06/27/2008 07:50 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","City":"Waynesboro","Object Flight Path":"Other","Object Features":"Unknown"}
