The light was glowing and blinking differently than a plane, much brighter lights than a plane has. I arrived home a few minutes later and they were hovering near my house in the sky parallel to each other. One object was higher than the other but because the way they were stationary in the sky, they could have been at the same altitude. I went inside to get my dad and tried taking a picture with my phone but that did not work. As I tried to take a picture (with no success), the objects moved and started going east. There was no noise and nothing that would have made you believe they were planes or helicopters. They took off at a tremendous amount of speed in the same formation as they were when they were hovering. Both my dad and I thought that these objects could not have been planes or helicopters."],"Object Features":"None"}
