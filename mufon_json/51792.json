Because back in 1985 or 86 me and 2 others went camping in the Wind River Mountains about 50 miles S.E. of Pinedale, WY. 8,600ft. up.We had just got there and setting up camp got a fire going when I saw a ball of light or fire not sure what it was heading away from us on an angle when it was like ���Hey someone���s over there��� it turned came straight at me and stopped like 6 or 8 feet from my face and sat there for to me seemed like 10 to 15 seconds then shot straight up No it was not ball lighting. I told my story to a neighbor here in Clark, WY. And he said he saw the same thing a few years ago here in Clark so I know they are real but what are they? I have experienced and seen so many things from the age of 7 and now 61 to know something is not right. Things that some people think are just made up scifi stuff are real!!! Very real I would love a chance to go on national television and take a polygraph in front of the world and tell my stories but I found that no one cares really no one cares about the things I have seen and experienced.
