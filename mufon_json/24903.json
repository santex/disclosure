It had a slightly domed top with white and blue randomly flashing lights that completely surrounding the object. Holding out your arm a golf ball would have covered it up. I quickly ran outside and saw it disappear in the distance. It went in a straight line east to west. The complete event lasted less than two minutes. I see airplanes fly by in the distance regularly; but, never anything that comes close to this."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Object Features":"Dome","Date of the Event":"08/01/2010 10:50 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-91.662593","Summary":"Surrounded by blue and white flashing lights.","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Date Submitted":"08/02/2010 06:23 UTC","Country":"United States","City":"Cedar Rapids","Log Number":"US-08022010-0011","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.98575,+-91.662593(24903)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24903) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24903.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24903.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"24903"}
