The large shadow moved in a west to east direction very fast completely blacking out the moonlight on the rooftop areas as it passed. It startled me and I scanned the sky but saw nothing that could cause the phenomenon. I became very nervous and uneasy and went back inside the house."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Nevada","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39796.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39796.html"],"City":"Henderson","Tags":"City","Summary":"Large object moves thru and casts shadows across the rooftops","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.041645,+-114.976861(39796)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39796) map </A>","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-114.976861","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 36 other sightings in Henderson","There were no other sightings in Henderson on or around June 25th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"06/25/2012 02:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
