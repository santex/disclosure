I was watching the stars- like always- looking for evidence of other beings ( really BIG geek about it) then I started to realize there was a straight line of lights blinking I thought it was an airplane because we live close by the airport but the object was just hovering it was in one place. I told my mom and she freaked out and said that it was weird looking. I was looking at one of the UFOs then i couldn't find it so I asked my mom and she pointed in a completely different spot. I was so freaked out when I got home i ran out of my front yard and it was descending put of the sky. I told my mom to come look at it. But she moved to a different spot in the yard and she was looking at a completely different place in the sky and there was a red version of what I was seeing. I was so happy i finally saw one my dreams have been answered!!!!!!"],"Region":"Oklahoma","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43958.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43958.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:07:11","Date of the Event":"11/16/2012 09:45 UTC","City":"Grove","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Grove","There was one other sighting in Grove on or around November 16th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.612406,+-94.743177(43958)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43958) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11162012-0021","Object Features":"Dome","Summary":"There were two UFOs the lights were in a straight line and were blinking randomly it would descend and ascend with a red aura around the body of the object"}
