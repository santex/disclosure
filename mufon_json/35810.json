The deck is less than 15 feet from a river that is roughly 120 yards wide. I heard what at first thought was a helicopter approaching a few feet above the water but quickly realized the sound was barely audible and it passed directly in front of me at eye level with no shape visible and only a whisper of a noise. It passed by at a speed of roughly 50 mph with no wind moving the trees. Only the faint whooshing which is how I roughly gauged the speed of movement. The sound quickly moved downriver maneuvering between the treeline and above the water. That's all the detail I can really provide."],"Date of the Event":"10/20/2011 02:05 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Georgia","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Hawkinsville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35810.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35810.html"],"City":"Hawkinsville","Date Submitted":"02/14/2012 06:59 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-83.472118"}
