I walked out about 10:00 p.m. and just sat on my backdoor steps for about mabey 25 minutes. Thats when I noticed for what looked like, a star. It was moving at a good rate, not too fast, much like the last one. And just about in the same spot in the sky as the last one. Only this time it didnt dim out of view. It just vanished when it got ready to leave. I will keep watch for another and report if I see any more."],"Log Number":"US-07222011-0002"}
