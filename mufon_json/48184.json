Where jet engines should have been were large spotlights. 4-5 ft across. Two total. Reminded me of headlights on a vw bug. The aircraft as large as it was flew only yards above the trees. The craft made no sound at all. After it passed I could hear only the sound of the air being displaced. Kinda like a wind. I don't know what it was some sort of secret propulsion system being used on regular cargo type pane or what. Don't think it was alien craft but maybe a way to test alien propulsion system in disguise. Any it was Unidentified an it was a flying object for sure"],"Object Features":"Wings","Log Number":"US-06172013-0003","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
