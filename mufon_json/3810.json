{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was coming home from SLC. I took my normal route. I turned East on 200 West in Provo just before you cross the train tracks. I could see the University overpass and the mountains against the night sky. A large cluster of lights moving very fast past in front of my view. They were lower than the mountain tops which are about 10,000 feet. They flew in a south south west direction until out of sight. What was interesting was that looking at them head on they were quite bright but their light dimmed once they past over. It is hard to say how many there where. I estimate between 20 to a 100."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3810.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3810.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/25/2005 10:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.33028,+-111.086211(3810)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3810) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3810","Latitude":"39.33028","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-111.086211","trends":[],"Log Number":"US-09052005-0003","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Large cluster over Provo","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/25/2005 10:40 UTC","Region":"Utah","Country":"United States"}
