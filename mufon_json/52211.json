{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving home from Moorpark tonight, passing through the La Ca���ada Flintridge area heading east on the 210 when suddenly I saw bright blue-white orb dart straight down across my vision in the near distance, about less than a mile from me on the opposite side of the freeway. It was perfectly round and did not blink or flash. It had a very pretty icy bright blue color. It was quick but graceful, flew effortlessly and was almost instantaneously gone from sight. Like 1 or 1.5 seconds. I was sitting in the passenger seat coming back from a late meeting with Clay's Mom and I exclaimed, \"Whoa! What was that?!\" because the object was so NOT a plane flying! It did not have a tail like a comet, nor did it fall and burn up like a falling star does. It freaking zipped across the sky! It was like the size of a nickel if you held one up at arms length... smaller than the moon, but bigger than a star. My boss was driving and she was afraid I saw something on the freeway so she looked to the road and did not see it in the sky. I said to her, ���That was weird... That thing was not like a plane or a falling star\" but then we kept talking and I was still thinking of it all the way home. Here���s where things get interesting... I get home, walk in my front door, and my husband jumps up from his computer all excited and says, \"Babe, I just saw a UFO!\" and I say, \"I just saw it too!\" and my husband asked, \"What color was it?\" And I said \"blue\" and then Clay proceeded to explain EXACTLY to a tee what I had just seen; only he saw it about 15-20 minutes later than I did in Upland, CA. This is my second UFO sighting in my lifetime! (My first is a much longer story from when I was a little girl in Ulupalakua, Maui)"],"Date Submitted":"11/13/2013 01:23 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.206818,+-118.200028(52211)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52211) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11132013-0001","trends":["There have been no other sightings in La Cañada Flintridge","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52211.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52211.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Bright Blue White Spherical Orb darts across night sky and dissapears","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.206818","Longitude":"-118.200028","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"11/12/2013 08:30 UTC","Region":"California","City":"La CaÃÂ±ada Flintridge","Case Number":"52211","Country":"United States"}
