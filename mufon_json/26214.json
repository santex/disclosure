It was late, and we were sitting out watching the stars. Then we saw a meteor. Then another. In the space of about about 10 minutes, there were 20 meteors. About a minute after the meteors stopped, something else, which I thought was a meteor at first, appeared. It was reddish and very slightly brighter than the stars around it. It stayed there for about 1 minute. It then moved what would be roughly six inches if held at arm's length to the northwest over a course of about 2 seconds, and just stayed there for another 2 minutes or so, then faded and disappeared. ~Mad Vulcan"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Missouri","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.859507,+-93.052323(26214)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26214) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10302010-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Unknown"}
