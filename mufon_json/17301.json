This thing was moving towards the moon from the northwest in a southeast direction...when it got to about the point in the sky where the moon was, it made a kind of arc, then traveled back down that same line...and continued on to the southeast. I then noticed it get duller and duller, like it either \"phased out\", or kept going straight through the atmosphere. At 5:00 this morning(June 2, 2009), my wife heard a low hum with a kind of pulsing in it, that lasted for about a minute.She saw nothing, as it had her scared out of her wits."],"Date of the Event":"05/30/2009 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.489531","Date Submitted":"05/30/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"31.028362"}
