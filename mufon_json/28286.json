At least it looked like it was above her yard to me. It was silent and had many lights coming out of the bottom that were moving around. It was beautiful, I was amazed and just stared at it thinking that it was going to go away at any moment. I thought the object was a UFO. I told my mom the next day and she did not beleive me, she said to wake her up next time I see a UFO in her back yard, jokingly.The UFO made me fell kind of hypnotized I dont know if it was all the colors or the fact that it was a UFO. It was 10 years ago and this part is a little fogy but I think it kind of just vanished,no sound or lights just gone."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-87.842234","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Date of the Event":"11/30/2000 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Huge colorful disk or circle shape with a lot of colors coming our the bottom","Log Number":"US-03182011-0019","Source":"MUFON"}
