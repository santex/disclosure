I noticed a bright white light appear on the western horizon and tracked it steadily east until it disappeared again over horizon. WAY too bright to be a satellite, stars were not yet visible. No flashing or blinking FAA lights, no sound. I went inside & grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look - to the naked eye object appeared to be a single white light, however when viewed through binoculars object was five lights arranged in a circular pattern."],"Region":"Colorado","Country":"United States","Case Number":"39303","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/09/2012 08:55 UTC","Log Number":"US-06122012-0018","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.348276,+-108.281039(39303)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39303) map </A>"}
