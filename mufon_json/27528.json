They were three lights straight across in a line. The object appeared to be hovering in the sky. It was a clear night and I could see the object very well and it did not appear to be far away. I live near Willow Grove Air Base and the training exercises are usually done directly near my house. The object was clearly not a plane and did not move like a helicopter. It was also not even in direct line of where the base would be. My first thought was, \"this must be what people report as seeing a UFO.\" I turned the corner and was going to ask my husband to come look when I got home. I saw a neighbor and looked at him to see if he was looking toward the sky and noticed the object. He didn't. By the time I got home, I forgot to tell my husband. I remembered a few days later. Have not seen anything like that since."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"27528","Longitude":"-75.120776","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.182302,+-75.120776(27528)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27528) map </A>","Summary":"3 lights in a straight line hovering above in sky","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01262011-0010","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.182302","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27528.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27528.html"]}
