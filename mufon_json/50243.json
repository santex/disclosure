{"Region":"New York","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was about 4 in the morning. I had woken and had a very strange feeling that what I had experienced the four previous times I've reported was very close to being made available to my conscious mind. I was both very relieved and very nervous. My residence is up a hill from the main road so no car lights would reflect into my window. Also, I heard no aircraft, helicopters over my home so there was no known source of the lights. They left after a few short moments, but again, I had a residual feeling that I was very close to knowing, in real time and not shrouded in amnesiac memory, what was really going on. And it felt okay. The vision I had right after that was of an almost normal looking human but with a very bright light eminating from his right eye.
