A nearby 12 year old boy pushing a girl in a stroller was heard saying \"I don't know what that is. What is it?\" I looked to see what the boy was talking about and he was looking skyward. I looked up and saw An orange fireball flying at airplane altitude. We were just 20 miles or so from CLE airport. My whole family saw this fireball hovering then moving in a erratic path. I pointed out that it had no blinking lights as a plane should. As we watched it pause then begin to move again it disappeared instantly. My wife commented that it was as if it knew we were watching it so it disappeared. The boy who alerted us to the object said he could still see it but it was not glowing. It was not visible to me or my family at the point."],"Date of the Event":"08/25/2012 08:40 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"42020","Summary":"Orangish fireball hovered, the moved quickly in northern direction befor disappearing quickly.","Date Submitted":"08/25/2012 10:40 UTC","Longitude":"-81.901687","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42020.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42020.html"],"Log Number":"US-08252012-0021","City":"Chippewa Lake","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.07091,+-81.901687(42020)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42020) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Chippewa Lake","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Ohio"}
