We were looking up at the sky as some geese flew by. My husband was the first one to notice, and he pointed it out to me. We both watched as a vertical line of three or four faint, yellowish lights moved steadily across the sky in a straight path. The lights were very small and seemed to glimmer, not blink, and they seemed to be at least as high as a jet would fly. After three to five minutes, the lights just faded away. We stood looking for another ten minutes trying to find them again, but they were gone. The only thing I remember feeling was puzzlement. I've never seen anything at all like what we saw today."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.628382,+-103.200489(8261)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8261) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/31/2007 05:20 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Sterling","Summary":"Vertical line of 3-4 faint, glimmery lights","Longitude":"-103.200489","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:03:30","Log Number":"US-11012007-0002","Date Submitted":"10/31/2007 05:20 UTC"}
