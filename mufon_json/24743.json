It was spherical, but divided into hemispheres by a slight ridge and also each hemisphere was divided into quadrants. It flew at an altitude of maybe 1 to 2 thousand feet and disappeared behind trees faster than I could run to snap a shot. It flew east to west, horizontally. The kitchen girls got kind of excited seeing me run. It had a mirror like surface. At first I thought weather balloon, but today I decided to look at photos of weather balloons and can't find anything near what I saw. I estimate that it was 15 to 20 feet in diameter."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Sphere of mirror material.","Log Number":"BZ-07242010-0010","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"24743","City":"San Ygnacio","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/06/2010 12:00 UTC"}
