At first I thought they were planes but they were glowing too brightly. They were moving slowly to the north and then disappeared from view behind the mountain. The glow from the lights was about twice as bright as a star and green. I have never seen a star that looks this kind of white-ish green before. I was shocked when I noticed it wasn't anything that i was familiar with because there were a couple of sighting of UFOs a week or so before in the Tucson area, so I pulled over to check it out. I managed to get a picture of it before it disappeared. It moved in a very straight, slow, and steady formation. I'm pretty sure I lost sight of it because it went behind the mountain, but it just seemed to disappear."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
