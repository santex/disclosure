The object appeared to be moving at a constant speed and also in a straight line just north of where i was standing. I thought it could have been an airplane or an helicopter considering we live north of the Detroit Metro Airport. But the object kept moving in the sky and did not take any direction toward the airport at all. As I looked closer, there was not one blinking light that airplanes would have. For how far the object was, it looked to be moving faster than a airplane. I could see other airplanes in the sky that were traveling about half the speed, and this seemed to be at an higher altitude. Which made me wonder..How could an aircraft at an higher altitude travel faster than a aircraft at a lower altitude? I knew to myself this couldnt be an aircraft, unless it was on fire because there was a certain radial glow to it. As it passed my friend and I, the object seemed to disappear into the sky within a couple of seconds. The sighting last for about 20 seconds"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Garden City","Log Number":"US-11072009-0016","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Latitude":"42.325593","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Garden City","There were no other sightings in Garden City on or around November 7th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.325593,+-83.331042(20367)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20367) map </A>","Summary":"Orange Glowing Sphere Traveling Across Sky From West To East","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/07/2009 08:30 UTC","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-83.331042"}
