It had been very hazy that day and into the night. It was my second trip to the Canyon, as I previously visited 3 years prior (that time it was clear and you could see every star in the sky, very spectacular). Anyway we were taking a walk around the south rim at around 9-10pm. You couldn't see many stars as moist as it was outside. All of the sudden a bright white light caught my eye off to the northeast. I initially thought it was a plane with its landing lights on, being as bright and obvious as it was. It looked to be maybe 80 to 100 miles away to the northeast. I watched it for a good 10-15 seconds, then, from a standstill, it darted off to the north at an unhumanly fast speed and quickly disappeared."],"trends":["There have been 24 other sightings in Flagstaff","There were no other sightings in Flagstaff on or around March 27th 2006"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28558.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28558.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Summary":"bright white light","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-111.630299","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States"}
