I saw a large star shaped orange glowing object, glide acrosss the sky then dissapear as quickly a it came. I was thrilled to see the UFO, as I have previously witnessed the silver disc object that some people saw in south Devon in 1994.The thing that struck me about the UFO was that it was the most beautiul, bright burnt orange colour. We did have a camera with us, but as it was brand new we werent sure how to video the UFO. Hopefully someone else saw it ad would have taped it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24123.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24123.html"],"Date Submitted":"07/04/2010 02:51 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Exeter","There were no other sightings in Exeter on or around July 3rd 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"50.726152","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"24123","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Oval, Star-like","Log Number":"GB-07042010-0006","Country":"United Kingdom","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Exeter","Tags":"City"}
