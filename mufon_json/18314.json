It went over the roof of my house continuing to ascend until it disappeared into the clouds.This was witnessed by my neighbours plus visitors and all my family. 9 people in all. we thought at first it could have been a hot air balloon,because it had a bright yellow flame in the middle.But it had no basket and it had blue and red lights flashing round it.
