(afterwards i thought it was possible that someone could've been pointing lasers at low cloud\\fog cover, but it couldn't have been cloudy if i could see that star.) the circles of light were spread out almost in a line and as they moved from east to west they split into two separate formations of equal numbers. as they came closer to my house i expected them to move faster, but they slowed down! they then rejoined into a group and as they passed over my house they spread apart, still moving slowly and then they were out of my range of vision. my feeling at the time was mostly surprise. i was talking to my mate while observing this and as the circles started acting less like something recognizable, i was becoming more excited and astonished finally exclaiming in complete amazement pressing my nose against the glass. needless to say, he thought i was crazy as he did not see them because of not having a direct view of the window. i have never seen anything like this before.\""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-86.900608","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Summary":"Not Provided","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17292.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17292.html"],"Case Number":"17292","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06012009-0012","Latitude":"32.322581"}
