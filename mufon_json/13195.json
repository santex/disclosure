I may have been going West,and seen what I thought was two yellowish-orange lights blinking and was not sure what it was. Then I didn't see it, I thought maybe is was a plane or a radio tower and it was just blocked by some trees. But then it reappeared. As I got closer it looked more like they were two sets of lights maybe 5-6 in a row and they were rotating around an object. It appeared to be rotating from right to left. Could not really see the actual object because it was dark, I could only see the lights. I tried to get a picture but it just faded out and I didn't see it again."],"Country":"United States","City":"Hillsboro","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Hillsboro","There were no other sightings in Hillsboro on or around October 23rd 2008"],"Log Number":"US-10232008-0018","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.010989,+-97.130006(13195)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13195) map </A>"}
