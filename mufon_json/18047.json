{"divs":["Sighting Detailsin passing i saw a corpse of a hairless, dull copperish colored animal that looked like the dog-like animal videoed by state trooper shown on tv. on right side of road, intact with no obvious dismemberment or abdominal swelling (as if fresh). i saw it as clearly as possible at highway speed in closest lane. i am well versed in north american wildlife and could not place animal as a fox or coyote because of size, coat, or body type. shaven house dog maybe - pointer or setter sized."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 96 other sightings in Wilmington","There was one other sighting in Wilmington on or around July 13th 2009"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.242092,+-77.944144(18047)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18047) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/13/2009 12:14 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/13/2009 12:14 UTC","Summary":"cuprachabra","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18047.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18047.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.242092","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-07132009-0012","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Case Number":"18047","City":"Wilmington","Longitude":"-77.944144","Region":"North Carolina","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Hoax"}
