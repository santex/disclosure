A strange burst of wind hit me. This wind was blowing in a circle,and making a strange humming sound. Much like a high powered electric motor. I would have thought it was a natural occurance had it not been for the humming. This wind was blowing at 30-40 mph in a circular pattern. I know this because I could see the tops of the trees bending in a circular pattern. This noise stayed over my head for about two minutes,before moving away. I watched the tree's blow in a circular pattern for about one hundred yards as it moved away. My feelings and reaction were of terror. I was armed with a rifle and a handgun and was terrified. Somthing flew over my head I could not see. I'm certain of it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.162038,+-97.425855(20373)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20373) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20373.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20373.html"],"Longitude":"-97.425855","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
