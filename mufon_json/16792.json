The object in the right-center is VERY interesting. It may be that this is part of a street light, with the pole obscured by whatever. I have not enlarged the picture to examine it more closely as I wanted to send the raw picture for you to see. It reminds me of the spacecraft in the movie, \"Independence Day.\""],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"16792","Longitude":"-78.468638","Date of the Event":"05/04/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Observed as still traffic cam picture.","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.036676,+-78.468638(16792)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16792) map </A>","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Charlottesville","There were no other sightings in Charlottesville on or around May 4th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
