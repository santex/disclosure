Last night when I was drying off I happened to be looking up and noticed a large structure like craft with lights moving silently across the sky in a straight line. This craft was not flying in a traditional senses like a plane it was just moving. My girlfriend was still in the pool so I yelled to her and she was able to see it also. We both where excited to see this and stood outside for a few minutes hoping that it wood return. It was like nothing we had ever seen before, we don't know what it was, we only know that it was real. After about one minute the object was to far away that we lost sight of it."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/09/2013 11:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47319.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47319.html"],"Summary":"HUGE STRUCTURE WITH ABOUT 7 LIGHTS MOVING SILENT THRU THE SKY","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Palm Springs","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05102013-0013","Latitude":"33.831536","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Palm Springs","There were no other sightings in Palm Springs on or around May 9th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.831536,+-116.538562(47319)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47319) map </A>","Region":"California","Date Submitted":"05/10/2013 11:05 UTC"}
