I watched the stars and noticed a high altitude drifting balloon I thought, yet it drifted oddly and bounced back and forth, then stopped overhead, bobbing back and forth, it came from the north east. Then I saw a meteor coming from the southwest direction from the horizon to overhead in less than 3 seconds and stopped next to the other object, They oscillated together for a while, I got scared and ran back to the hanger."],"Longitude":"-81.648031","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15076.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15076.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"15076","Log Number":"US-01232009-0006","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 66 other sightings in Jacksonville","There were no other sightings in Jacksonville on or around April 17th 1985"],"City":"Jacksonville","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"30.335744","Date of the Event":"04/17/1985 03:16 UTC","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"04/17/1985 03:16 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
