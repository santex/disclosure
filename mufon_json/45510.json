I woke up and was going to turn the channels to see if there was something on to watch. When suddenly a soft, light, glow came in through my windows, brighter than the glow of the tv. I went to the window and looked down thinking I would find people with flashlights or car lights in my yard. But I found my yard was empty. Then I looked up. I was shocked to find a UFO hovering above me and to the side above my home. I had my windows open as it was a fairly cool night outside and I became aware that it was eerily quiet. The UFO moved slowely toward the east and I could see that it had patterns of clouds moving across it's face. The night was clear. It suddenly with light speed flew away and in one second was gone. I was not afraid. I thought \"How fun.\" Then I wondered if anyone else in my area had seen it too."],"Summary":"In the early morning, I saw a light glow coming through my 2nd story house window. I went to window, looked down first then looked up. I saw a huge craft hovering above me to the side of my house.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
