Time is estimated to be around 8 to 9am. Sky is clear, weather appears to be comfortable, no evidence of wind in the picture, sun is rising from the east, causing long morning shadows. Mothers are seen talking amongst themselves and with teachers, their kids are lined up waiting to enter the school. Located at the center top of the photograph, right above a tree, appears to be a silver, saturn shaped UFO, banking either asending towards the left, or decending toward the right. This is based on optical features (shadows?) shown on the UFO. I am no optical expert, however it does seem to be evident from normal viewing that one branch from the top of the tree is showing to be blocking the view of the lower left rim of the UFO. If this is the case, this object would be truly quite large. Nobody in the schoolyard appears to notice or hear the object, however, considering the social environment, this may be understandable. I don������t know what kind of camara was used, but it surly was not digital. This object does not look like the moon in any circumstance IMO. What is needed is some serious optical analysis to rule out traditional IFOs. Remember, this is 1972. There were no commercially available aluminum helium balloons for kids at the time. Nearest airports are La Guardia Airport, located about 12 miles to the WNW of New Hyde Park and JFK, located about 10 miles to the SW. This area of Nassau County is a high air traffic area. I doubt official weather balloons would be released under such air traffic conditions."],"Region":"New York","Latitude":"40.735102","Summary":"Possible Saturn shaped UFO shown banking over New Hyde Park, Long Island In September, 1972 photo.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03042009-0016","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.735102,+-73.687908(15841)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15841) map </A>","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/04/1972 08:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15841","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.687908"}
