(since this event date, i have seen other images in this picture at randomly!) 4. i was last to leave the dinner table and my spouse had opened the blinds. i looked down to study something in my lap (papers to read i guess) and noticed a swift movement and looked up and figured it was a big deer with a horn (rack) trotting by. we live in the hills and wild animals are around. this event is similar to a person in their car looking down, and noticing a figure moving outside the car--via the outside mirror. 5. i awakened by my spouse's snoring on 12\\14\\04 about 3am. i got up to make some instant milk and it was 3:35am. i considered sleeping but decided to let my mind wander on a personal event: i met my spouse and i left a company. happy memories and big ones! 6. then noises came from the roof (above out bedroom). when i questioned it out loud my spouse said it was raccoons. (next morning i did check our roof top and there were tree branches ready to be cut since they were laying atop our roof.) the roof tapping subsided to a corner of our bedroom. no more noise. 7. i must have dozed off but i became conscious and decided to open my eyes. there i saw a human male looking at our bed comforter; bent he was at 90 degrees. he saw me and straightened up and my eyes followed him to the wall which is not 5 feet away from me in bed. he floated backwards into the wall. i waited a few seconds. i spoke to my spouse and said that i saw a ghost. he mumbled. i then looked at my clock--it was 5:30am and our window blinds were open and i could see the sky lightening or the sun rising. the human apparition was wearing a cornflower blue long-sleeve shirt with a bright belt buckle and khaki long pants. he was skinny with his right hand at his eyes. he had thick-framed black eyeglasses. two months later i learned from another neighbor that one of our neighbors had expired. i figured this apparition was my neighbor having an out of body experience. 8. later that morning, i took day-time pictures with and without our bedroom lights on. without the lights there is one orb. exactly where this apparition exited. that is my event for 2004 december 14 morning. there was another event in the 1975 year. this one was witnessed by me, my pop, and two sisters. it was in the daytime and a small ufo was seen by my pop and he questioned it and asked us girls to observe it. from my recollection: a small hindenberg with no strings attached to it and the base was similar to the cbs program lost in space. the base had squares lit up and rotating in a clock-wise fashion. there was no noise. i reported this one to sjsu science class in 1984. i have no homework to prove this one because someone stole my homework. but the teacher at that time gave me a 9 out of a 10 for seeing a ufo. this was a 5 minute event. another event regarding the shuttle that came back to tx and shattered its parts. one circular on-fire part did fly over our home (in the hills). i reported that to nasa's e-mail web-site. i mentioned in that e-mail that we were not going to hunt for it. that was a 2 second event. it obviously burnt out."],"Latitude":"37.269142","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/14/2004 05:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
