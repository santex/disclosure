{"Longitude":"-122.489538","Case Number":"44609","Region":"Washington","Latitude":"45.605278","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at work, in Vancouver WA near the PDX Portland OR airport, and I turned around to look out the window at the beautiful clouds. The sun was in my eyes so I moved my position so that the sun was just covered by the window frame. Just beneath the sun there was a cloud out of which a bright reflective circular disk type UFO zipped, changed directions into an upside down U shaped flight path then it disappeared in thin air. The whole thing happened within a matter of an instant. If I had blinked I would have missed it. I would have thought this was just a sun lit piece of fuzz floating in front of the window had it not: 1. flew so quickly and changed directions so quickly, and 2. vanished into thin air. Not two seconds after I saw this, a commercial airplane flew by. I was very excited, I have been waiting to see a UFO for quite some time now."],"Date of the Event":"12/13/2012 01:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Vancouver","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 54 other sightings in Vancouver","There were no other sightings in Vancouver on or around December 13th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"Zipped out of the clouds on in a U shaped flight pattern, changed directions quickly and the dissapeared in thin air.","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44609.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44609.html"],"Log Number":"US-12172012-0011","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.605278,+-122.489538(44609)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44609) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/17/2012 07:02 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04"}
