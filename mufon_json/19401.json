I looked at them and studied them:They were bright white circles standing in a vertical formation.About 5 of them.When I looked closer these lights were moving in circular motions while remaining in a vertical line. We were on our way to bed and my cousin said\"Whats with all the lights?\" She ignored them but i watched for about 5 mins.I wasnt sure what to make of it so i dismissed it and went into bed.While I was in bed I began thinking about the lights and a cloud of light sleepy air took over my mind and then I went to sleep."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.114836,+-74.322104(19401)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19401) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"New Jersey","Log Number":"US-09192009-0018","Date of the Event":"02/16/1988 11:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 07:08 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19401.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19401.html"]}
