It had a luminescent smooth surface about the color of the moon and slightly larger in surface area. The edges were symmetric and defined. There was no trail behind the object. It was traveling directly (straight line) South to North with no sound. The front was the point and back was round. I spotted it at about 55 degrees above South horizon for about 10 seconds before disappearing behind cumulus clouds at about 75 degrees above North horizon. Estimate an altitude of at least 5000 feet or greater. Size would depend on actual altitude. This event happened at the Kalamazoo address. I was approximately 10 years of age and thought it was a UFO or a large asteroid passing by Earth (except it didn't look like an asteroid because of its symmetry). I told my parents, but they didn't believe me."],"Date of the Event":"06/15/1955 09:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Kalamazoo","There were no other sightings in Kalamazoo on or around June 15th 1955"],"Case Number":"35814","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-85.613174","Latitude":"42.289929","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
