{"City":"Round Rock","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Stopped at a red light i noticed a series of flashing lights in the distance","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt first i thought i was looking at a radio tower as the object grew closer i ruled this out,the closer the object came i was more curious as i have never seen anything like this before in the sky the light patterns and color were also unfamilar to me, the object had all red lights which would flash 1-2-1-2 and all five would light up at once. The object from the sort of looked like a cross as i passed the object the side view looked different then from observing it head on viewing the pictures it appeared to have a different shape upon driving passed the object. Overall i would say the event made me feel nervous."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.510455","Date of the Event":"06/30/2010 11:19 UTC","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Round Rock","There were no other sightings in Round Rock on or around June 30th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.510455,+-97.674886(24133)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24133) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.674886","Date Submitted":"07/04/2010 06:52 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24133.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24133_submitter_file1__0630102319a.jpeg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24133_submitter_file2__0630102319b.jpeg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24133_submitter_file3__0630102319c.jpeg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24133.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Object Shape":"Cross, Unknown","Case Number":"24133","Log Number":"US-07042010-0016"}
