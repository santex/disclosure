{"Case Number":"47399","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"27.940456","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy boyfriend and I were driving west on Hwy 60 (Brandon Blvd.) approx. 7:20 PM around April 25, 2013 we were in some heavy traffic and I noticed the sky was filled with trails and was hazy. The sky had taken on a milky appearance. I snapped a pic on my phone and forgot about it. I have been curious about the jet trails in the sky and sometimes photograph them. Just today, May 13, 2013, I was going through images on my phone and stumbled upon an image that I cannot understand. Look just to the 11:00 hour above the shorter electric pole and zoom in, you will see 4 lights, that look like they are casting shadows. There is also another light, similar to a crescent just above the brighter lights to the right. I have no idea what this is and I did not see this in the image when it was photographed...I'm freaking out a little because I had no idea this was on my phone."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-82.290209","Object Shape":"Cigar, Other","Summary":"I discovered this picture on my phone.
