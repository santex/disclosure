Bright star like object that moved slowly then would stop and hover. After hovering would change direction move slightly change direction then stop and hover again. Most of the time it seemed to be reflecting light it would get very very bright then dim out almost completely. At times it seemed to emit a bright orange glow the fade out again. It never moved quickly but changed its direction quite a bit. No characteristics of a plane or helicopter. We watched it for approximately 45 minutes. Finally we went home still watching it- at times it would seem over head and then would move off again. At home continued to watch it heading toward the south. Went inside checked back a few minutes later- there within twenty minutes lost sight after going inside. Awesome."]}
