{"Summary":"4 or 5 very separate circle lights in somewhat of a inverted V formation","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"9741","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-117.148015","Date Submitted":"02/27/2008 07:15 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy mom and I had just left her house and it was almost dark but still some light dusk and I was driving and I said what's that my mom said what and I said up there and pointed and she said what and I pointed again up into the sky and I said it looks like a ufo and the formation seemed to be changing and I watched it just seemingly disappear. I have never said look there's a ufo or anything like that before. I was shocked when the 10 oclock news said it was going to have a ufo sighting on it and stayed up to watch I thought it was what I had seen and I even called my mom to tell her to watch. It wasn't talking about my sighting it was about others. I was disappointed. I wonder if anyone else saw it."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"32.723629","Date of the Event":"02/27/2008 07:15 UTC","City":"San Diego","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02282008-0001","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.723629,+-117.148015(9741)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9741) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9741.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9741.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 151 other sightings in San Diego","There were 8 other sightings in San Diego on or around February 27th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
