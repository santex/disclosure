It was a gigantic, very bright light with a cone shining down. As if someone was shining a gigantic flashlight down thru the clouds, except it wasn't cloudy. It was way too big to be a plane and it was moving slowly upward. It was far away from us. We viewed it for about a minute. The light went out and the cone slowly faded away. The most amazing thing I have ever seen. My son remarked, \"The lights went out and God got a flashlight\"."],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Cone","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Tags":"City","Summary":"It looked like someone was shining a flashlight down on earth.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"09/19/2009 09:38 UTC","Latitude":"40.220753","Disposition":"IFO","Region":"New Jersey","Case Number":"19427","Object Features":"Unknown"}
