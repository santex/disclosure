When I looked at them on the computer, I saw what looks like a flying saucer in one of the pictures and a fast moving object in the video. I slowed the video down to 1 tenth speed to try and determine if it was a bird. There appears to be several white spots under the photo with maybe a funnel like affect. The video could be a bird, but it would have to be dive bombing really fast down from the clouds."],"Case Number":"19745","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date Submitted":"09/30/2009 01:03 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO"}
