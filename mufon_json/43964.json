In a matter of seconds they had traversed the sky from east to west in a straight line horizontally. It was clear they were far beyond our atmosphere yet they were not shooting stars or falling stars or any other kind of space debris. These where objects traveling in a path at an amazing speed and traveling together. The event happened so quickly that there was no time to grab a camera or a witness. It was an amazing sight to see and so hard to describe it properly!"],"Date Submitted":"11/17/2012 12:20 UTC","Latitude":"39.108606","Log Number":"US-11172012-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.108606,+-94.577267(43964)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43964) map </A>","City":"Kansas City","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 2 other sightings in Kansas City on or around November 11th 2012"],"Summary":"8 fire ball like orbs traveling horizontal east to west at a speed that is impossible","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/11/2012 02:30 UTC","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43964.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43964.html"],"Country":"United States"}
