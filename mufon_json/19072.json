I thought at first it was a baloon but noticed that it never moved even though there was a good breeze blowing at the time. I observed it for about 15 minutes when an airliner passed overhead and i noticed the object was between myself and the jet,thats when i got a good ideah of the size of the object floating in the sky. I went inside to get a camera and as soon as i brought it up to take a photo it literally shot off at such a high speed i could not even begin to calculate it. the object was approximately 10ft in diamter and appeared to be rotating,the surface also appeared to be like liquid silver. When it disappeared i knew that i had observed a UFO for the first time in my life and i was quite thrilled."],"City":"Boise","Log Number":"US-09042009-0010","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19072.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19072.html"],"Longitude":"-116.202676","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Idaho","trends":["There have been 69 other sightings in Boise","There were no other sightings in Boise on or around May 31st 2005"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"43.619271","Date Submitted":"09/04/2009 08:58 UTC"}
