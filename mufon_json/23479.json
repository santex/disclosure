Whenever I'm outside at night, I'll look up just to star gaze and sometimes track the movements of planes as they're always flying overhead from the many airports in the surrounding area. Since I grew up in the area, I learned early on what a plane looked like overhead at almost any height. This was definitely not a plane. At first I noticed one that seemed to be flying from the north towards the southeast, and when I continued looking, I noticed a second that was south and a little further west of it. The two were moving in the exact same direction, even when they changed to due south, at the exact same speed. We watched for several moments as they continued to move south, staying bright orange, as they moved. Then they started to blink, or flicker as the continued to go south. The blinking was at various rates, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. After several seconds of that they were just gone. There were no tails or streaking behind them to indicate a falling meteor or satellite, on top of they were moving much too slow to be that. It's a fairly cloudless night, and we could continue to see stars near where the orange lights were flickering. What has perplexed us (my girlfriend was there with me and saw them as well) was the slow, in time movement."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-05272010-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"23479","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23479.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23479.html"],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Easton","There were no other sightings in Easton on or around May 26th 2010"],"Longitude":"-75.217742","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.693332,+-75.217742(23479)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23479) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/27/2010 12:08 UTC"}
