In the West not too far away, I saw two bright white light (huge) heading towards where I was. I ran for my camera in my car and it was above me, low enough that I could see a distinctive triangular shape with three red lights blinking and a row of red lights in the center. It moved slowly overhead as I filmed it the best I could. I do not recall any noise. I did state on my video that I have never seen a plane like that if it was a plane. It was quite large and the shape is what made me feel that it was not a plane. Planes move much faster than this was moving esepecially if they are directly above."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"27.669427","Log Number":"US-10072011-0026","Tags":"City","Summary":"Triangular shaped object moving from WNW to ESE at night, clear sky","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"32438","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Florida"}
