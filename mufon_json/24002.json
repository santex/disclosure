My boyfriend pointed out that the wheat was flattened in various areas of the field. As he said this, I looked out the right side of my window and noticed a perfect disc shaped depression in the wheat. We didn't have time to stop and investigate as we were on a time deadline before he had to go to work. I really only saw these crop circles and designs with a passing glimpse, but it definitely caught our attention. We live around tons of wheat fields and have never noticed anything like that before. I wish someone would investigate or take a flight over the field to see if there is any sort of overall design. It might be explained in a natural way...we've had a lot of storms around here lately, but the disc like depression in the wheat is odd."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24002.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24002.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","City":"Milan","Longitude":"-83.678718","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Milan","There were no other sightings in Milan on or around June 28th 2010"]}
