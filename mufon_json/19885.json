Through the window, it was slightly obscured by tree branches. Even so, I thought I could see it moving, and thought it might be some kind of UFO. I promptly put on my shoes and jacket and went out into our front yard to see what it was. I walked out of our front yard into the street. To my front was a bean field, and behind me was my front yard, which is full of large trees so I could not see any of the western sky. The light was no longer there, but in front of me to the North-East I saw an object that looked almost like a star. It was moving slowly towards the west. It moved much too slowly to be a plane (there are two small airports a few miles East and West of where I live, so I have seen airplanes nearly everyday for my whole life, and I know what they look like). As I watched it move from North-East to more in the Northern sky, I saw it rise quickly (compared to how slowly it was moving) in a manner that would have been impossible for a plane. It eventually disappeared behind clouds in the Northern sky. As I watched this light, I noticed two more. One was not too far from the first star-like light I just mentioned, but it disappeared much sooner than the first. The other light I saw was more in the Eastern sky than the others and much higher in the sky. It was similar to the bright orange ball of light I first witnessed, but I only saw this slow moving light two or three times before it completely disappeared in the clouds. It too, disappeared much sooner than the first star-like object. When I saw the star-like objects I was not willing to immediately say they were craft other than airplanes. But because of their behavior I just described I came to the conclusion they were not planes. At about 11:40 pm I had to go back inside the house to take care of a matter before midnight. Then at around 11:55 pm I decided to go back outside to the road to see if there were anymore lights. I then saw what I would call some kind of craft flying from the North to the South. It passed by the Western sky as it went its way, not directly above me. I could see a bright, white-yellow light on the front of the craft. On the back was a flashing white light. I could tell that there was some kind of structure between these lights. As I watched the craft, I could tell it was not a plane because of the slower speed it was moving at, and it made no noise. Occasionally it seemed to almost slow to a stop. I then ran back inside to get my video camera. When I came back out the object I was watching was more toward the South-West by then. I then started to film a craft that was quite similar to the previous craft. I could tell that it was not a plane because it showed basically the same behavior as the other craft (but it moved quicker more often). It actually slowed significantly then shot forward rapidly a short distance. I was standing in the road, so these were all over the horizon beyond the bean field. I then noticed below this craft in the distance were two smaller lights. They were star-like, but they seemed to be orange. They were usually moving much too slow to be airplanes. You can see these in the attached video. In it, you can see that the larger craft gets dimmer and almost disappears from the camera���s view, (though I could still see it fine). You can also see three or more bright ground level lights, but can tell that they are at ground level as opposed to the crafts. At about three minutes into the video a car came down the road. I stepped off the road towards the bean field to continue filming. I then counted at least six lights in the sky that I could see. You cannot see them in the footage. I attempted to zoom in on the lights, but they were mostly too dim for the camera to pick up. Some time between this event and the one after this, I saw what I thought to be a plane. I thought I got in on film but I made some kind of mistake and do not believe that I did (it also did not seem to come in on the camera very good anyway). I thought it was probably a plane but it was moving much too slow, and it made virtually no noise. The sound it did make I would have to compare to the sound of a breeze blowing in your ear, though also it was something of a soft rumbling noise unlike that of an airplane (especially one that low). It looked triangular. At each of its three points was a bright white light. The front light and left-rear light were static. However, the right-rear light was flashing. The lights seemed to illuminate the bottom of the craft. If that is what I saw, I believe that it was black, but the parts most illuminated looked somewhat gray-ish due to the light. If I had been standing in the bean field, I believe that it would have been above my head. I later saw it South down the road over a corn field, joined by another craft that had come from the West. At about 5 minutes into the film, I turn my attention down the road to the South. You can see a green-white spotlight that I believe someone down the road had put up on a telephone pole. To its left is a corn field and you can see a bright orange UFO. When it appears to be beneath the street light it is moving across the road (it is nowhere near the street light). As I filmed this I noticed that all of the lights that were in the sky had been moving toward the South. I also saw another triangular craft that I thought might have been an airplane. By then I thought it should have been much farther away. The light over the field that I just mentioned kept going back and forth from being over the field (I���m assuming it was over a field, but it was so far down the road it could have been over anything) and crossing over the road to the other side of the road, where it would disappear behind some trees. Sometimes it would just reappear over the field. It often went from being dim, to shining like a bright orange fireball. It would usually shine brightly over the field as opposed to over the road. At one point it was bright over the road and just blinked out and disappeared. On the video, you can see it over the road going slowly toward the trees then suddenly jerk backwards and disappear. It did not usually appear to have a smooth flight path. Often it was rather jerky. At one point I did see it rise higher in the sky, but I only saw it do this once. In the video you can hear me remark that it sounds like there are people yelling about seeing the light. It turned out it was just my family wondering where I was. At that point I ran back to the house to my family. I left the camera recording through that and so I have edited this out (I came back out around 12:33 or so). Some of the events I described above could have happened after I came back out, but I do not remember clearly. As I ran back to the house I turned around to see that the first light over the field was joined by a second, significantly higher in the sky. I also saw more lights to the East as I watched these lights. They were some of the ones I noticed going toward the South (in the video, I mistakenly repeat that they were going North). The one bright light over the field was occasionally joined by others. At one point, I saw two lights above the field. One (to the right) was higher than the other. They slowly moved towards each other, but they were too dim for the camera to pick up. I then turned on my camera���s ���night mode��� and they became visible to the camera. You can then see them flying away from each other toward the left (east) and right (west). At one point, I saw a craft I had previously thought was a plane stop over the field and above one of the other lights, thus erasing any lingering doubts as to what it was. Eventually I decided to go back to the house because it was so late. I have attempted to recount my experience the best I could. Due to time, and watching the video, my memory may have gotten mixed up on a few details and I may have stated a few events out of order (especially toward the end). Neither the video nor my retelling gives the event justice. In all, I believe I saw between 15 and 20 flying objects. These events fit well within my worldview so I was not scared. I was amazed and sometimes in doubt as to what was going on, but never scared. I was happy I was able to witness such an amazing event. The video was about 28 minutes long, but I have cut it to 15. I plan to put up all of my footage on YouTube."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like, Triangle, Other","Date Submitted":"10/10/2009 02:50 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/07/2009 11:30 UTC","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.051294","Summary":"From 11:30 pm to 1:00 am I witnessed several different types of Unidentified Flying Objects in the Northern, Eastern, and Southern skies.","Case Number":"19885","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-86.467008","Sighting Duration":"01:30:00","City":"Lebanon","Disposition":"Hoax","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Lebanon","There were no other sightings in Lebanon on or around October 7th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19885.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19885.html"],"Log Number":"US-10102009-0006","Country":"United States"}
