It was summer. I saw the first one at 7:30 before sunset. My mom was with me. I looked at the sky and I saw a silver rice shaped ufo and it was shiny. There was a jet to I dont know if it was chasing it it was real fast. It went away in a few seconds. My mom didnt see it. Then another night I was walking with my mom and I saw the second one. It looked like a big and yellow star and I thought it was a weird star. It was about 9:00. It was like that a while then some jets went by and in a minute it moved and turned into a black triangle with three lights. I dont know if they were yellow or white. It flew over my apartments and I told my mom to look and she thought it was a plane. I told my step dad and he said it was a stealth plane but they dont do that. Then another night I went on a walk and I was looking for ufos. I saw three stars in a triangle and they looked like the other stars. Then they moved and turned so they were on the other side and went over walgreens and they looked like they were coming down and I got scared. They were moving away from each other then I couldnt see them."],"Longitude":"-85.598364","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.319614,+-85.598364(6355)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6355) map </A>","Object Features":"None","City":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/30/2002 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6355.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6355.html"],"Region":"Michigan","Summary":"I saw three ufos","Case Number":"6355","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Other","Latitude":"44.319614","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar, Star-like, Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":[]}
