With a couple of friends. I noticed a bright light flying in the sky and pointed it out to them. As soon I I said it, something flashed about 500 ft to the left of the object. The flash only happened once. After that flash, the bright object then started to appear smaller and smaller. At this stage it seemed to be turning red. So basically, it looked as if it were going straight up, after flying horizontal for a minute or so. When it traveled over our heads that's when it appeared to fly off into space. The object did not fly off into the horizon or into the distance. I just want to be very clear of that. The object flew into space, that's my final opinion. I hope this helps. Also, my friends and I can't stop talking about it. We are confused as to what could have flew into space.
