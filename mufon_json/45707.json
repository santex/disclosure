I saw nothing unusual. I walked across my backyard and threw something in the trash and I looked back up at Canis Major and noticed that between the top two stars were two stars I have never seen before. They were as bright as the stars in Canis Major and were about as far apart as the two top stars of Canis Major. These lights were vertical and made a diamond shape with the top two stars of Canis Major, where the top two stars of Canis Major were horizontal. I looked in confusion because I have never notice these stars there before. They were completely still and when I was about to accept them as stars I have never seen, they started moving straight down in tandem. The space between them remained consistent as if they were lights at each end of one object. They moved slowly but steadily for about 15 seconds until they faded out."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Carrollton","There were no other sightings in Carrollton on or around February 14th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-02152013-0001"}
