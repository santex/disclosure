{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was about to walk in the back door to my house. I looked up and saw what looked like a satellite but was much brighter than a normal one. There wasn't any blinking lights or anything else like noise from an airplane or helicopter. I went inside to get my girlfriend's 14 year old brother. When we went back outside it was still there on a direct path heading from NW to SE. Then the object slowly got dimmer and eventually disappeared. The entire event lasted for about one minute."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/26/2012 12:09 UTC","Longitude":"-99.897713","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Case Number":"39816","Log Number":"US-06262012-0001","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/25/2012 10:23 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39816.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39816.html"],"Summary":"It looked like a satellite heading SE.
