I was sitting on my truck's tailgate, looking to the east towoard my horse and saw a bright, flashing light at about the 4 o'clock position in the eastern sky. The object was above the house next to our property. It appeared to \"flutter,\" as though a diamond or triangle was blowing in the breeze. My first thought was that it was a mylar balloon, but it was in the far distance and shouldn't have been so visible, had it been a balloon. As I watched, the light would pulsate, going from very faint to a flashing bright. The object approached a small bank of clouds and I thought I would lose it in the clouds, but I could see it pulsing and fluttering as it went through the small bank of clouds. A friend was in the area, but she couldn't see the object,as her far sight was bad. The object flashed very bright a couple of times, and I could see that it was heading east, at what appeared to be a high rate of speed. It didn't appear to be an airplane, because the flashing of light appeared to be almost rythmical. An airplane reflecting the sunlight would've reflected it and then been lost to the eye, but this object continued to be visible by flashing. It appeared to be \"fluttering;\" like a leaf in the wind, but stayed stable with the horizon. After about 5-7 minutes, the object was lost behind the visible horizon. I am always looking up, I like to fly; I try to identify the planes I see flying overhead. I'd sure like to know what it was that I saw!"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Pulsing, fluttering, light seen moving east toward mountains.","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.416039,+-121.365678(18038)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18038) map </A>"}
