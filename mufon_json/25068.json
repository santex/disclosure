{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25068","divs":["sighting detailswe were lying on the beach on a sunny sunday afternoon, blue sky, few clouds. we were watching a jet airliner which had recently taken off from gold coast airport on a northerly heading (possibly 3000 feet altitude). we suddenly noticed something following behind the aircraft on the starboard side, at about a 45 degree angle from the aircraft, about 200 meters away (large passenger aircraft never follow this closely), and travelling at the same rate of speed. we could not identify the aircraft following because it didn't have any wings, a tail plane or flashing lights. it was oval\\cigar shaped and it was shiny like a mirror. the jet airliner flew into a small cloud and then reappeared out of the otherside continuing on its path. the unidentified aircraft flew into the small cloud and disappeared, but did not appear out of the otherside of the cloud. this event happened over a period of about 30 seconds and we couldn't understand what we were seeing. unfortunately we didn't have a camera available to take photos. i am a commercial helicopter pilot and quite familiar with aircraft laws, rules and protocol. the following craft we could not identify as any type of conventional aircraft."],"Longitude":"153.305645","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Queensland","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"-28.031714","Date Submitted":"08/11/2010 11:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25068.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25068.html"],"Object Shape":"Cigar, Oval","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"UFO closely following jet airliner.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-28.031714,+153.305645(25068)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25068) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/06/2010 02:17 UTC","Country":"Australia","Log Number":"AU-08112010-0009","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Gold Coast, Queensland","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Gold Coast, Queensland"}
