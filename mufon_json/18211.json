When we were near same area I just started taking photos in hopes one would show up. I had read that digital cameras pick up what the eye cannot see so I just took random photos and this popped up. There was actually nothing in the sky that we could see but something did get caught on film. My work requires me to go out to Grand Rapids at least once a week and I always get a wierd feeling when driving through this area. It freaked everybady out so we did not stop. You can tell it's not a bird by it's realtive size and the picture was taken out an open window."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Hovering object near Gerald Ford Airport.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18211.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18211.html"],"Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"18211","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Grand Rapids","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.96441,+-85.658526(18211)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18211) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.658526","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Grand Rapids","There were no other sightings in Grand Rapids on or around July 18th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07202009-0023","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
