{"Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details Bright disc shaped light showed up again right on schedule 7:50 pm Aug 22. I posted yesterday that this same weird light keeps appearing in the same spot at the same time. I told everyone in north Vegas to look west over the mountains between 7:50 and 7:58pm. Well 7:50 rolls around and the object appears. I was on Lone mountain Ave near Simmons Ave, looking west. I had my binoculars and sony cybershot 7.2 mega pixel camera ready in case it showed up for the third night in a row, it did. In the exact same spot a bright light suddenly appears like a very bright star (no stars are out yet) it was two finger widths (held at arm length) above the mountain tops (see 1st picture). It then hovered and descended very very slowly. It seemed to not move in a perfectly straight way. It went almost straight down, but moved slightly left and right, slightly favoring the right as it went down. It took 5 minutes to go one finger width down towards the mountain (no plane fly���s that slow). It took another five minutes to go the other finger width and disappear behind the mountain. I looked with my binoculars and it looked definitely disc shaped and bright shiny white like a very, very bright star. It had no strobe light and I looked at it for the whole ten minutes, except for the time I took to take some photos. My camera is not designed for this kind of shooting, I turned the flash off, (ISO mode), and tried to keep the bright nearby lights out of the frame and took three shots. It shows up good in one , bad in another and not at all in the third. The Photo were you can see the object pretty good (1stphoto) you cant see the mountains very good, so I also attached the not so good one because you can see the mountains better and you can still see the object (although its fuzzy and hard to see). I know it won���t convince a skeptic but it will at least show where it was in relation to the mountain. It looks kind of like a star with a tail, I did not see the tail, it only showed in the picture. This picture was taken within the first minute of it appearing. My binoculars are (16x32) and I had to steady them on a wall but I could see it very well and am sure it���s not an airplane or helicopter. It has showed up in the same place 3 nights in a row. Aug 20, 21, 22 at 7:55, 7:53, 7:50pm respectively. If it follows the obvious pattern it will show up tomorrow (Aug 23) at 7:47pm. Please if anyone in the Vegas area reads this go look at it. Anywhere in North Las Vegas that can see the mountains to the west could see it very easily. Use binoculars for the full effect and if you see what I���m talking about post your sighting."],"Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in North Las Vegas","There were 2 other sightings in North Las Vegas on or around August 22nd 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Case Number":"12180","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12180_submitter_file1__1stPicture.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12180_submitter_file2__2ndPicture.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12180.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Windy","Summary":"Bright White, Disc Shaped Object Appeared again third night in a row. same place, same time.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"36.208189","Date of the Event":"08/22/2008 07:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Date Submitted":"08/22/2008 07:50 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Nevada","Log Number":"US-08232008-0003","City":"North Las Vegas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.208189,+-115.112121(12180)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12180) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-115.112121"}
