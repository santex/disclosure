They were leaving a trail of light behind them. I thought I was seeing things. Then they did something really odd, they changed directions (it seemd like they were doing a dance.). Not just once but numerous times. They were very erratic. They fell for a while and then shot back upward then back down at another angle leaving a trail of white light behind. I pulled over to look and other cars started to pull over as well, so I knew I wasn't seeing things. They were making lightning shaped patterns in the sky. I have never seen anything like this. It was amazing yet terrifying at the same time. All I kept saying is \"what the hell is that?\" I wonder if anyone saw these things. Unfortunately I couldn't get a picture of it. The glow was too dim by the time I got pulled over to the side of the road. Has anyone out there seen this? It was freaky!!!"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.716353,+-74.000893(36912)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36912) map </A>","Longitude":"-74.000893","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"New York","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36912.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36912.html"],"Latitude":"40.716353","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/27/2012 05:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around March 27th 2012"]}
