It was completely silent and moving very fast, but much lower, faster and larger than the usual air traffic coming to and from Pittsburgh. This thing had no strobes or FAA lights just three VERY faint white lights at each corner (about 90% sure it was one object) I would have never noticed this object if I had not been looking in that general direction! It was not a satellite, I see them often. I can���t stress enough; it was like it was ���almost��� invisible!"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.069795,+-80.740083(16550)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16550) map </A>","Summary":"Very dim, silent triangle flew over my house."}
