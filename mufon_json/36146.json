Not sure what made me look up because the object or objects made absolutely no noise. When I did look up, I saw a single bright, glowing, red light shoot through the sky so fast that it could have been easily missed. Somewhat in disbelief of what I had just seen, I stood there wondering whether or not my eyes may have been playing tricks on me. Literally seconds later, another brightly glowing red light shot through the sky headed the same direction, very close to the the path of the first object. After seeing the second object, I knew I had actually witnessed something that could not be explained. It was NOT a meteor or something falling from space. No tail, no trail, no noise, and flying relatively low. Later that evening, I ran into my neighbor at the post office and he asked me if I had seen the red fast moving objects also. He had seen them as well when walking his dog."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","City":"Slanesville","Latitude":"39.375","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36146.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36146.html"],"Summary":"Extremely fast red lights"}
