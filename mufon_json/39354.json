I heard a loud whir. I saw a green and blue light. My younger nephew saw it too from his toy pen. I heard him scream in amazment. I couldnt believe my eyes. I was astonoshed. Ive seen those UFO shows but I was very sceptical by the evidence given. I was scared. Creatures fall from the object. They dissolved into mid air as they decended again and continued to repeat the motion. I almost called the police but knew they would not believe my story. I took pictures and sent them to my uncle who was a scientist at West Michigan University years back. HE told me it was all a joke and to just give it up. Well I didnt. I called local news and they had said they have not heard of any other sightings. Have I gone mad? When I was watching the creatures fall I realized this was no joke but it just dissapeared so when I brought the evidence to my uncle I had nothing to prove the situation. I decided to eat bullshit because thats all this story is. xoxoxo- Jerry ������"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Burnips","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
