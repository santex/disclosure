They also were moving at super fast speeds, faster than any aircraft I've seen move. i only saw them for about 8 seconds my girlfriend noticed them a little longer but we both said afterwards how when we first saw them it registered in our brains as something not being right and it seemed so odd and weird. i felt really excited afterwards because i am certain that we saw UFO's."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Lehi","There were no other sightings in Lehi on or around April 1st 2013"],"Date Submitted":"04/07/2013 06:23 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
