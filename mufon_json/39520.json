It looked almost like a flare or something on fire. It was incredibly bright and larger than the moon. When I turned to corner to stop and look the ball came closer and was a triangular craft with a headlight in front. It was very close to the ground and moved slowly but was silent. I could see the outline was a triangle NOT A PLANE. Then it just took off and was gone within a few seconds.I thought I would be terrified if I ever saw a UFO but I was strangely calm. My first reaction was to follow the light but it came to me."],"Region":"New York","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"40.717253","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around June 19th 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.717253,+-73.998083(39520)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39520) map </A>","City":"New York","Case Number":"39520","Object Shape":"Fireball, Triangle","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.998083","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-06202012-0002","Summary":"Bright light that came towards me and truned out to be a triangular craft that shot away after a about 30 seconds.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/19/2012 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/20/2012 01:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
