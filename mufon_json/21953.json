The windows weren't lit up. It was so fastand totally silent. No one else was with me. I came in and told my co-workers,Pam and Chris,they laughed at me, and said \"It was the space shuttle, it's suppose to land this morning.\" I was raised around aircraft,my dad was a flight instructor for the Air Force. For a more precise date you could look back to a night the space shuttle was landed about 5a. I can't remember an exact date. It wasn't a stealth aircraft, I've seen pictures of these. If it was an experimental aircraft of some sort, it was strange. I do live about 50 mi. south of Cape Kennedy. I never knew of this network, just found it tonight on my laptop. It disappeared over the apartment complex behind the nursing home,where I worked as a nurse,over the treetops,not seen again."],"Summary":"While sitting in garden area in back of Consulate Healthcare.","Longitude":"-80.606839","Date of the Event":"03/21/2006 03:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-02202010-0009","Latitude":"28.088807","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/20/2010 09:46 UTC","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in Melbourne","There were no other sightings in Melbourne on or around March 21st 2006"],"City":"Melbourne","Weather Factors":"None","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21953.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21953.html"],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome"}
