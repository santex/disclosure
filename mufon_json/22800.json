My attention was drawn to an extremely brilliant, silvery dot almost directly overhead, moving very slowly east to west. The sky was bright, with a very slight haze of thin cloud. there was no sound, no contrail, no wings, fuselage or empennage. I observed it for approximately six seconds. When I called my wife's attention to it, the object vanished instantly. I am an Air Force veteran with knowledge of aircraft appearance and performance. I was in Military Intelligence with access to mission profiles. I have flown aircraft, including as co-pilot on a chartered passenger plane. In college I majored in Astronomy and Cosmology with a 4.0 average, with extensive knowledge of natural astronomical bodies and events. This object I observed displayed none of the attributes I am familiar with. It was, and is, a UFO."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Norton Shores","There were no other sightings in Norton Shores on or around April 5th 2010"],"Date Submitted":"04/13/2010 02:45 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.168904,+-86.263946(22800)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22800) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.168904","Longitude":"-86.263946","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"04/05/2010 11:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"Michigan"}
