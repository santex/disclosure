However, the object was outlined with low dim yellowish lights that defined its shape and direction of travel. It was noiseless and flew with some sort of intelligent control. It kept same speed until it got out of sight. I called the HOUSTON CHRONICLE news desk as well as CH 11 HOUSTON news room and gave a detailed description of my sighting in case someone else would call it in. I was unable to take any photo of video, it caught me unprepared."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-95.243001","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"01/22/2009 07:25 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","City":"Alvin","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.427247,+-95.243001(15068)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15068) map </A>","Case Number":"15068","Country":"United States"}
