As a police vehicle had just passed by on the road in fornt of me, i assumed it was his lights. Turning to look i noticed something falling from the sky towards earth. I want to state that i am not sure what this object was, as for all i know, it was a meteor. The thing that made me second guess was the trajectory of the object and a combonation of the bright white color and sparks it emitted as it fell. Although small, the object was bright enough to catch my attention with my back to it. It fell north-northeast of town. It was roughly 50 degrees and clear skys."],"Region":"Missouri","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Warrensburg","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3428.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3428.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Not Provided","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-93.73605","Latitude":"38.762789","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3428","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Warrensburg","There were no other sightings in Warrensburg on or around April 9th 2005"],"Date Submitted":"04/09/2005 09:28 UTC","Log Number":""}
