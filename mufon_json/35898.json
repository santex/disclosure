I was traveling at about 40 mph, going north on Gilbert Rd, Mesa AZ. At first, I thought it might be something like a sign being pulled by a plane for advertising purposes, but quickly realized there was nothing pulling it. I did not at first perceive it moving at all and since I was driving directly towards it, that I would be able to clearly see more detail as I approached. But as I got further along, I realized it was flying from my right to left in the sky and seemed to be gradually descending. I did manage to snap a picture with my phone, but detail is lacking as it was quite a distance away by the time I managed to take the shot from my moving car."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-111.828442","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.419464,+-111.828442(35898)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35898) map </A>","Summary":"Driving North 9:15 am observed from my car a rectangular solid dull gray object slowly gliding east to west","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Mesa","There were no other sightings in Mesa on or around February 16th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Region":"Arizona","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02172012-0031"}
