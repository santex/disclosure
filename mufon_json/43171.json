I am a Park Ranger who was closing a park gate and happened to look up at the stars when I saw what may or may not have been a meteorite. It was more sustained and larger than any meteorite I have seen to date. The park gate is across from a small airport. Less than a minute after I observed this light a low flying jet (which did not take off from the airport nor was it landing there) followed a path in the general direction of the observed light. The jet did not appear to be a commercial plane. I am by no means an expert on aircraft, and given the darkness of the time when it was observed, it had the appearance of a F-16 fighter jet flying slow and low. I may have merely observed a meteorite, however, I wanted to add this to your database."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43171.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43171.html"]}
