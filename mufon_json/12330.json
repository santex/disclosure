Aug.25th.of 2007,i was sitting with my lady friend on her patio about two doors from mine,my back was to my patio,and she was facing my patio,we were talking and all of a sudden her face changed,her mouth fell open,her eyes got big and i immediately said,\"what?what? and turned to see about 10 to a dozen of huge round lights on an oval object hovering just above the trees near my patio.We jumped up,i grab her hand and told her,\"c'mon,it's a ufo\" we made it to my patio in about 3 seconds flat.we were almost directly under this thing when it seemed to see us & ever so gently turned away from us & GLIDED away.I was looking so hard at this object to see a top,a bottom,sides,something,but there was nothing,and absolutely no noise at all!also, the lights were in the front & halfway around the sides,so when it turned we no longer could see it. we were so close that i could've hit it with a rock.After it left we just stood there looking at a dark sky,we went back to her patio to sit down and i was mad at myself for running after it,because i wondered if we didn't,what was it going to do.There was no logical reason why it would be hovering between two trees as if it were watching US."],"Latitude":"40.133599","City":"North Belle Vernon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12330.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12330.html"],"Summary":"Sitting outside on our patio,myself & a friend saw a ufo hovering just above the trees.","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-79.862012"}
