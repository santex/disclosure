{"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.795029","divs":["sighting detailsmy dad and i were in the car going down a somewhat busy street on a friday night. i am always looking at the sky in hopes of seeing a ufo. well i always end up seeing weird lights, and immediately classify those lights as jets\\planes\\stars\\satellites. well friday night we were cruising down the road and i notice a star. i take a quick look at it, and see the bright starlight shutoff, and then the light came back on. as if it was pulsating or blinking. as we come to a stop, i realize it is moving pretty fast across the sky. i try to keep watch and tell my dad to pullover, he is not interested so we keep driving. i try to keep watch as trees and buildings pass by, but i lose sight of it. i finally convince him to pullover at a baseball field, as we turn down the street we come up to a round a bout. as we are circling the round about i see 1 star in the sky. within about 2 seconds, i see that 1 star split into 2 stars and the second star descended rapidly, then ascended and came back together with the original star. then once again it split into 2 stars and the bottom star descended and disappeared. so i told my dad to rush to the field, i get out of the car and quickly run out to observe the sky. i see nothing but stars and airplanes. i know i saw something, its just the timing was off. we didnt get to the field fast enough. as far as im concerned we never have ufo sightings in raleigh."],"Region":"North Carolina","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-78.69235","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.795029,+-78.69235(32629)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32629) map </A>","Country":"United States","City":"Raleigh","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/16/2011 04:47 UTC","Object Features":"None","Summary":"2 sightings within 5 minutes- Starlike","Date of the Event":"10/14/2011 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Raleigh","There was one other sighting in Raleigh on or around October 14th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32629.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32629.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"32629","Log Number":"US-10162011-0018","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change"}
