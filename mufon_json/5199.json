Where I live, aircraft going overhead is occasional ��� I don���t live under a heavily trafficked air route. The commercial airliners I see are almost always going east to west or west to east. From my orientation on the deck, they���re always going left to right or right to left. While stargazing, I picked up a single point of light moving across the sky from south to north. It���s size and luminosity was about the same as a bright star in the night sky. The Big Dipper rises up over my house every night and this was about the same as one of the stars in that constellation. It was traveling at about the same altitude and moving across the sky at about the same rate as a commercial airliner. It traveled in a perfectly straight trajectory. Since there was nothing else moving across the sky at that moment, my eyes were drawn to watching this point of light move across the sky. After it had traversed about 30 degrees of sky, it winked out. Just disappeared. Then, it reappeared about 10-15 degrees later, still on the same course. Winking out and reappearing got my attention but what really got my attention was that when it reappeared, it was momentarily much brighter than it had been before and then quickly resumed its former luminosity. While visible again, it traveled about the same distance as before then winked out again. The same pattern repeated. It disappeared for 10-15 degrees worth of sky then reappeared, very bright at first and then back to its original luminosity. It repeated this behavior about 3-4 times before it finally disappeared for good from my view. The night sky was mostly clear with some thin scattered clouds here and there. I am also a private pilot and I am familiar with standard aircraft marking lights and anti collision strobe lights. I did not see any of these, just a single point of light like a star. I thought about: 1) An airplane, whose crew for some reason turned all their lights on and off at regular intervals. I don���t know why they would do that. 2) An airplane whose visibility to me on the ground was broken here and there by thin clouds. That seems to fit except it doesn���t explain why each time the light reappeared it was momentarily very bright. 3) A fireball meteor. I���ve seen videos of them where then flare up, die down, flare up, die down, etc. One of the reasons I like to stargaze is that I do get to see some shooting stars almost every night. I���ve even seen fiery meteors streak across the sky. This didn���t look like it was on fire or burning up. It looked more like a light somebody was turning on and off. Also, it didn���t appear to ���fall���, but instead travel overhead and keep going. 4) Space junk? Maybe, but doubtful for the same reasons as #3. The flight path was straight and true. Nothing odd about it���s movements. The only odd thing was that it would appear and disappear."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5199.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5199.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.212422,+-77.185045(5199)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5199) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Star like object that winked out and reappeared several times"}
