The 1st airplane going west turned & went south, The second object turned & came up in my direction.It glided very slowly & no noise the size of a football field. Had windows across like an airplane. I could light on th inside very bright lights It moved over the highway and was triangle in shape & had 3 huge lights underneath about 500 feet it was very low . Then it turned & headed west again. It took aout 30 minutes because it was 10:30 when I came in. I just stood their frozen not scared just in awe of the size. Then In August 1994 2 monyhs later I had my blinds off my windows Was watching TV & felt the need to rise up & look out my window, Their were 2 green glowing lights hovering for 15 minutes. This time I was scared because my dogs were sleeping & if someone had been outside they would have barked. I didn't go outside but I cut my TV off & watched a small green ball of light hover in a shed next to our patio. My husband was asleep & still doesn't believe.I didn't have any film in my camera but it didn't matter I couldn't leave for fear of missing something. Maybe it was government but I can't explain the hovering lights in front of my window at 12:00 P.M"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11535.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11535.html"],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"06/26/1994 10:15 UTC","City":"McGregor"}
