It looked like a moving star about the size of jupiter that started rising aboving the trees going faster than an airplane that was a solid white light. It had no blinking lights that indicated it was an airplane or helicopter. I know there was an airforce base east of where i was, but it couldnt have been a jet or stealth bomber. It left my eye sight as it moved past our house going in the opposite direction of the moon."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19818.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19818.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Rosebud","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-91.39759","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"10/04/2009 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Watching a star like object shoot fast above the trees past the moon.","Date Submitted":"10/05/2009 07:42 UTC"}
