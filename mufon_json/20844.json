My windows face lower Manhattan, just to give you a point of reference as to where the object was. I was sitting at my desk and decided to look out the window. The moment I did an unusually bright 'star' caught my eye. It was too low and to big to be a star, as I realized. I grabbed my camera and recorded a video. It was not moving, it stayed in that one spot, glowing very brightly. The moment I strayed from the object and filmed the whole sky, the object disappeared. It was gone by the time I moved back to the spot. In the video, you can actually see it disappearing as I move the frame away from it. The object did not reappear after that, and I searched the sky for its light after the video ended. But there was nothing. Several other people saw and even recorded this same object disappearing."],"Date Submitted":"12/03/2009 01:32 UTC","Longitude":"-73.996133"}
