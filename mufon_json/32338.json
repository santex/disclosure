(my eyes are getting teary and goosebumps on my arms)...... i saw it flash one more time about five degrees higher than it was. at the same time it flashed, it shot off at a 45 degree angle then when it seemed to be at ground level it went straight. it looked like it was skipping in the air. like, going and stopping, going and stopping, but super super fast!! it looked like a cresent moon with a white, greenish tint trail when it was shooting off. the first thing that ran through my head after i saw it shoot off was that it was god or jesus. about two hours later i called the nyc hotline for suspicious activity and reported it. i wouldn't be surprised if there was no record of my call because i felt like the operator did not take me seriously. now theres one problem with what i saw. since nyc is about 35 miles away, the object very well may have been over the bay. i use the empire state building as a landmark because it was in that line of sight, but there is absolutely a chance that it was not above the city, but above the water. are there any other reports of the same??!?!? i know what i saw and nobody believes me and i really want some closure.. i'll never forget what i saw that day and if i can be of any help to you, please fell free to contact me. thank you for your time.
