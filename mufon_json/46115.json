Outside enjoying a rare clear night in WA, hoping to catch a glimpse of the upcoming comet. 2. First notice objects in the north east sky, approx 8 fingers above the horizon (if you were to hold fingers horizontally). They were definitely the brightest things in the sky, appeared like a 4 point diamond 1 inch across. 3,4. At first we thought they were airplanes, but the quickly separated each going in their respective direction (ie left one shooting left, right one going right, the bottom light dropped just before disappearing and the one on top hovered in one spot until finally disappearing). 5. Still surreal... looking for and explanation. My family and I were postulating what they could be, my uncle who works at Seatac had never seen anything like it. 6. the top, right and bottom lights just disappeared, but the left light moved rapidly across the sky (much faster than the airplanes that were actually in the sky at the time) and disappeared over the NE horizon."],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.022451","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
