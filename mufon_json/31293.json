In the last photos we took before it went behind the clouds were clear enough that you could see that the object was spherical in shape and had a shadow underneath it also had a sort of disturbance around it. the object was observed north west of my apartment and was viewed from my apartment window. i have observed similar things in the sky 5 times over the last few years this is the second time during daylight hours (once in the morning and once in the evening). the camera lens had a spec of dust on it which is apparent in the photos but in no way does it obscure the view of the object"],"Country":"New Zealand","City":"Auckland","Date of the Event":"08/05/2011 05:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Shape":"Egg, Fireball, Oval, Other","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-36.84627,+174.768232(31293)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31293) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31293.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31293_submitter_file1__Untitled-1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31293_submitter_file2__ufo015.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/31293_submitter_file3__ufo016.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31293.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 51 other sightings in Auckland","There were no other sightings in Auckland on or around August 5th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"object appeared as steak of light then changed opacity/shape/orientation, then disapeared behind clouds","Log Number":"NZ-08292011-0027","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"174.768232","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
