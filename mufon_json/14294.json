{"City":"Sherwood","Log Number":"US-12082008-0002","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhen i was younger, i went over to a friends house who lived about a mile away from me. we lived in a forested area at the time, which has been turned into a houseing developement. THere were about 5 of us who saw this UFO late at night. It was very low to the trees. not near the ground but close to the tree tops. it had a large circular shape, with lights that were kind of in a flash. then it dissapeared very quickly. I could try to get a hold of a few of my friends to testify this. IT was a little weird.We were kind of scared, but we waited and stood there for a long time, and it seemed longer but I cannot really remember the exact amount of time it lasted. then we went back to my friends house who lived closer in a hurry."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Oregon","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Sherwood","There were no other sightings in Sherwood on or around March 31st 1994"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14294.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14294.html"],"Object Features":"Other","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"03/31/1994 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"14294","Country":"United States","Summary":"Large size, fast, had luminous lights.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.360207,+-122.835688(14294)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14294) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Other","Tags":"City","Latitude":"45.360207","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.835688","Date of the Event":"03/31/1994 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path"}
