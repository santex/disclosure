There is ALWAYS many up there performing with amazing speeds and acrobatics. They make the occasional F-16s flying by to and from Hill Field Airbase look slow and cumbersome in comparison. I have never seen one go in a straight line. They usually make wide sweeping arcs and looping or angled turns.
