I told my son to look at the cloud. It looked to me like a battleship and my son said that it looked like an alien ship to him. On Wednesday, May 22, 2013 at 2:35 a.m.(I looked at my cell phone for the time) I woke up for no reason. I looked out my bedroom window to see if the jets were flying. Instead of jets..Isaw the bottom of a huge space ship almost directly above my fathers home, just hovering. I thought what in the world! It had lots of round portals and around the portals were medium grey, elevated foam pads (it looked like to me). The rest of the bottom was a dark grey color. I could only see the front and middle of it, the back was over the house. It looked to be as wide as a football field (50 ft. or more). I went to check on my son and check the lock on the front door. I then looked out my bedroom window again and it was gone. I think this ship was in the cloud we saw, same size. I was pretty upset after this. Wondering if they saw me looking at it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.966656,+-92.73667(47625)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47625) map </A>","Longitude":"-92.73667","Object Features":"Window(s)","City":"Boonville","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Date of the Event":"05/22/2013 02:35 UTC","Log Number":"US-05252013-0008","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Missouri","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Space ship above my fathers house"}
