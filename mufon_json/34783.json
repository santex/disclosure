I was merging onto Parker Road approaching the Hampden exist and noticed in the sky before my turn this object in the sky over Cherry Creek Resevoir. I couldn't take a picture because I was driving and there wasn't any place to really pull over. I noticed that it looked like a plane that was vertical with no wings and had 3 lights on it. I recently watched the movie \"The Fourth Kind\" and this experience has completely feaked me out!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34783.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34783.html"]}
