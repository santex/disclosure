There is a method for catching these during the day which involves taking the inside of a floppy disk out and taping that material to your camera of choice. So the sory starts by me looking at the sky with my camera and the floppy tape attatched. It was a very cloudy day but with the techniqe i used it allowed me to see things that could not be seen with the naked eye. The next moment i noticed a small black dot start moving in very strange movments. Going back from left to right very quickly I decided to record this. The event lasted for 1 hr and i recored it for 5 minutes. Ive sent my video to Robert Marsh who gave me the link to this site. From what he said it seems like he likes the video. The video clearly shows an object in very thick cloud cover performing moves that an airplane, nor helicopter can make."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Log Number":"US-10102008-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.61309,+-75.485093(12993)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12993) map </A>","Summary":"Black circle","City":"Allentown","trends":["There have been 45 other sightings in Allentown","There were no other sightings in Allentown on or around October 8th 2008"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"10/08/2008 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.61309","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Case Number":"12993"}
