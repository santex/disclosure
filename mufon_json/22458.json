mine and had parked my car in the back parking lot of my apartment building, being that the front was all full. i noticed that i had to urinate pretty bad, and decided to take care of it in the soccer field behind my building. at this time i was alone and listening to my ipod, looking around to see if anyone was coming. i sort of gazed off into the sky in front of me (facing south\\east) and noticed that what i thought was a star was actually dancing around and connecting with others to make shapes (triangles, squares, spinning circles, polygons, you name it). at first i thought i had maybe gazed too long into a streetlight and was affecting my vision, but it continued to happen even after i was done relieving myself. i walked further into the field to get a better view of what was going on and noticed that the 3 or 4 lights i had seen dancing before was not the only ones in the sky, there was literally 20-40 of them. it was crazy, because they were really hard to see (light blue lights), they looked really far away but there was no doubt in my mind that they were all moving and extremely fast at that. they all kept making these shapes in the sky and changing 2 or 3 times within the same second, it looked like a lazer connect-the-dots type of show. i kept watching for at least 5 minutes before i realized that my roommates really need to see this before it goes away and becomes a story no one believes. i called up my friend lindsay, who was staying the night, and told her i was seeing this crazy ufo show going on in the sky. at first she didn't believe me but my roommates heard her say i was seeing ufos and rushed down to the field to meet me. altogether there was 4 of us now (mark, zac, and lindsay), and it didn't take long for them to see the same thing i had been watching 5 minutes prior to them meeting me. my roommates mark and zac both pointed out that hanging in the sky directly south\\east of where we were standing was a bright red, blue, and white light flashing and hanging in the same position in the sky. at this point i was rejoicing heavily since i wasn't the only one seeing this. we stood there and watched the faint lights for a good 15-20 minutes before we started looking around the sky behind us (north). i noticed another red, blue, and white light haning in the sky and flashing directly north of the one that was south east of us. then i looked up, and so did mark and we both saw the same triangle shape object moving in different positions directly above us. this is where we all freaked out and decided to head back into the apartment for fear of an encounter of the 4th kind. our apartment is on the top floor in the middle of our building facing south, so naturally we all decided to go on the balcony to continue viewing the tiny blue lights making shapes. they were still going at it, and faster than before. we noticed that there were more light blue lights dancing and making shapes more over to the west of us and that there were 2 more red, blue, white lights in the sky. one of them was close to the closer to the first one, only more south to us than east, and the other one was to the east of us. this is where it got way to real for all of us. zac's girldfriend, kayla, who was in our apartment the whole time we were all watching this came out on the balcony and pointed out the 3rd red\\blue\\white light out of the 4 (the one south of us). she kept pointing at it for about 30 seconds, and then i had joined in with her. the light started moving closer to us after we pointed at it. it got closer and closer, as it came into better view i could see that there were 5 lights on it that would fade in and out in order from left to right. there was a red light on it and 4 orange lights that kept spinning. it only took about 20-30 seconds for it to move from far south (where it looked like a glowing dot) to over our building. it moved way to fast to be an airplane and was moving on an incline like this (\\) with absolutely no sound. mark, kayla, lindsay, zac, and i watched it fly over our building and pass over the east end of our roof. i was freaking out so much when this happened, because i had never seen anything so amazing. once it passed our building i litterally felt like i was going to puke because i had never seen such a thing so vibrant and close to us. zac immediately ran down 4 flights of stairs to go back into the soccer field in hopes of getting a better view of it. when he got back he started yelling out that it was a huge circle and the lights were spinning really fast around the edges. he stated that the red lights were much bigger than the orange ones and that it was a metal circular object. zac, kayla, lindsay, and i went back out onto the field to see if anything else was going on that we couldn't see from the balcony. as we were standing in the middle of the field again watching, we saw someone coming out to us in the field. it was our old neighbor dave, who had moved out of our building and moved to hyde park in chicago, but was staying with our neighbors for a couple nights. he came out to us and started yelling \"did you guys see those lights!\" he was talking about the circular object that flew over our building. dave was in the parking lot with his girlfriend and noticed this thing fly over the building as well, making it 6 witnesses that i know of. it knew we were there, we pointed at it and it came and passed over our building, but we kept watching. the light blue lights still were going at it, making different shapes even at around 2:30-2:45. lindsay had pointed out to the 4th red\\blue\\white light that was west of us and we both watched it shine a light directly at us. this was too real and way too scary. we all decided to go back inside and watch a movie to calm down and go to sleep. all in all it was the most rediulous ufo display i had ever seen. i've seen dozens of ufo documentaries and actual footage of ufos caught on tape, but nothing had ever scaled the magnitude of what all 5 of us witnessed last night. we witnessed 30-50 light blue lights continuously moving and changing shape that was so fast it was hard to make out one shape before it changed to another. then we pointed at one of the red\\blue\\white lights and it came to us and gave us an awe inspiring glimpse of what it really was. my only regret is not owning a pair of binoculars or a video camera to capture this epic event."]}
