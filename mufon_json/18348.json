I took 3 photos of this creature by the fire. I didn���t see the creature until later that night! You can see it has an arm sticking out of left side in all 3 photos. Not sure what it is? A few minutes later we saw a huge white light in the sky moving towards us! It vanished very slowly. It came from the top of the mountain. We were in a very remote camping spot accessible to 4x4 only. I took photos of the object and it looks like a worm like white light."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18348.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18348_submitter_file1__CarrieBday-LOUFO-Esteswithbro134.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18348_submitter_file2__CarrieBday-LOUFO-Esteswithbro148.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/18348_submitter_file3__CarrieBday-LOUFO-Esteswithbro129.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18348.html"],"Latitude":"38.544529","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07272009-0012"}
