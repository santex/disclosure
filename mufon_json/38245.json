Viewed for apx 30 secs til I was able to activate my mobile phone camera. The object seemed to move slowly from side to side but stay headed roughly in the same general directon. It appeared to be a constant brightness and did not fluctuate or change appearance like a flare would. There was no sound and it was definately not something you see in the sky on an everyday basis such as an aeroplane or helicopter as flashing lights are required by law. It was definately not a star or celestial object as it was too close. It was travelling far too slowly to be a meteor of other piece of space debris. It actually appeared to be increasing in altitude as it got further away, but I am certain it's altitude did not decrease. A very interesting sighting indeed!"],"Longitude":"-1.234956","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"England","Date Submitted":"05/19/2012 06:47 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38245.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38245.html"],"Case Number":"38245","City":"Middlesbrough","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=54.574227,+-1.234956(38245)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38245) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Country":"United Kingdom","Latitude":"54.574227","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"GB-05192012-0012","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
