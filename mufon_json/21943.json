{"divs":["Sighting DetailsGot out of vehicle to visit family, 2 bright lights caught my eye, they were moving together @ the same speed, one ahead of the other, very slowly. I thought they were stationary, but observed them move across the big dipper. These were brighter than any star in the sky. They were both white light that remained constant. They were not aircraft (confident)I told my wife to look up and she saw the same, as they continued, they got dimmer until they faded away. I initially thought it was the ISS and shuttle, but I checked the NASA website and it lists it as a 5:00 AM fly over. It did look consistant with the last flyover I saw a couple of years ago. Still, it is always strange to see something unexpected and like that."],"Longitude":"-71.07436","Date of the Event":"02/19/2010 07:02 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Massachusetts","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21943.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21943.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"2 Bright objects together- non aircraft - South to north","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Haverhill","There were no other sightings in Haverhill on or around February 19th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.779772","City":"Haverhill","Case Number":"21943","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02192010-0010","Disposition":"IFO","Date Submitted":"02/19/2010 09:29 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.779772,+-71.07436(21943)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21943) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
