And then it was gone for a few sec was thinking it went behide a cloud then after that it was back lower in the sky and it was very sliver and round so I was thinking it could have been a weather balloon with something on it. and it just keep getting lower and I could see that it was very round like a big pea and looked like it had helicopter feet. Watched it for a few sec thinking ok its nothing odd and then it just went away and never seen it after that ."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States"}
