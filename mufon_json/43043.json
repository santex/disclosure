Myself and a roommate were watching the stars and airplanes coming to and from McCarran airport. Then I noticed off to the east just over the tops an extremely bright Orange-Red pulsing \"Star\" that was hovering in the same spot in the sky for about five minutes or so, about 20 times brighter than the standard airplane traffic so it was very noticeable. We watched the orb begin moving slowly SE and then just vanish instantly."],"Date Submitted":"10/05/2012 02:53 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.638405,+-89.396618(43043)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43043) map </A>"}
