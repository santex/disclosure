But now, because I may no longer be considered a hallucinating nut, I will tell my story. I did not see a UFO or a flying saucer. But, what I saw was a saucer . . . unpainted silver metal . . . parked in a large well-lit hanger . . . fitting the classic description of a saucer . . . with the words UNITED STATES AIR FORCE painted on the disc���s top near the saucer���s edge. How I came to witness this craft is through a bizarre string of events. In October 1956, my husband, who was an Army Ordinance Armament Engineer at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, and who had Top Security clearance, had orders to visit a Research and Development company in a Los Angeles suburb. Since his brother lived in LA and had never met me and our three month old daughter, my husband made arrangements for us to accompany him. Our commercial flight was to take off from the Detroit airport and fly non-stop to LA. As I recall, it was to depart in the mid-afternoon and arrive at our destination in the early evening there. For an unknown reason our flight was cancelled and all passengers were rerouted to other flights. I remember how nervous I became because I was in the process of weaning my infant from breast to bottle and the delay would upset the feeding schedule. This concern was relayed to the airline agent. Several hours passed and we were finally ushered onto the same plane that was the original aircraft scheduled to fly the cancelled flight. No one else was on board except the crew. It was explained that the plane had to be in Los Angeles for an early departure out from there the next day, so it would fly dead-head. It all sounded plausible. We were told that we would fly over the Grand Canyon and with such a clear moonlit night, we should see it clearly. The stewardesses and an officer joined us for visits and we were treated like royalty with food and drink. I did not drink, but my husband had more than enough and was soon in a deep sleep. After I saw the Grand Canyon, I closed my eyes and tried to rest. Even though it was very dark out, the stewardess lowered my husband���s and my window shades (we were sitting across the aisle from each other). In a short while, we started to descend. At first, I thought we had arrived in LA so I raised my shade. The airport we landed at was a large complex with many hangers and single-storied buildings, but I don���t recall seeing any that resembled a terminal. Since I had never been to LA before, I still assumed we were there. The plane came to a stop far from any buildings for only a few minutes. I heard little sounds and low voices somewhere in the plane. Then we taxied further down the tarmac to the end and turned to roll down another runway. That���s when I saw the large hanger with its doors completely open and all the lights on. Inside stood a saucer shaped disc that filled the center of the hanger. It had a clear dome on the top-center and stood on three legs. Various objects were attached, protruding out from the edge and underside. The words UNITED STATES (Star emblem) AIR FORCE were painted on the top disc near the saucer���s edge. No one was in sight in or around the hanger. I was shocked, but completely fascinated. I didn���t believe in UFOs or saucers, but here was one about 150 to 200 yards from me in plain sight. I tried to wake my husband so he could see it too, but it was useless. I had about two minutes to observe the craft as we completed the turn and rolled past it. Then, we made another turn and picked up speed for take-off. I don���t recall seeing any city lights in the area. When I saw the stewardess again, I asked her about the stop and the place that we landed at. I didn���t mention the craft I saw, probably because I may have still been in shock or maybe because I was aware that I���d seen something I shouldn���t have. I can���t remember her exact words, but she soothed me and said they just had to make a quick stop to drop something off, that it was nothing and would not delay our arrival time in LA. It seemed like we were aloft for a short while before we started our descent to LA. When we arrived at LA and my husband finally woke up, I told him about it, but he was in a grouchy mood and told me I was crazy. There was a rash of sightings in the 1950s and he scoffed at all of the witnesses���so did I. Later that night and several more times, I told him about the Air Force disc. Each time he got angry at me. He said I made it up or that I was hallucinating. He kept insisting that we were on a through-flight and there were no stops. He told me to shut up about it���that people would think I was nuts and it would affect his job, so I spoke of it no more. Every time I thought of that craft, my pulse seemed to race a little, but in time, I stopped thinking about it. I also stopped scoffing. I can���t explain why no one else but we were allowed to board that plane. Neither can I figure out why the hanger doors were completely open with no technicians or guards in sight. I really don't know for sure where we landed. After telling this story to a test-pilot friend he suggested that it may have been in Groom Lake, Nevada. But I couldn't swear to it. I���ve often wondered how many hundreds or maybe thousands of people worked on this project and how many more knew about it. As fantastic as this project was (is), I believe that the greatest accomplishment is in convincing people not to admit to it at any level. That really boggles my mind!"],"City":"Las Vegas","Summary":"51 years ago I saw a large silver saucer-shaped craft parked in a well lit hanger with UNITED STATES AIR FORCE painted on it.","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"09/30/1956 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
