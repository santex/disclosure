Verified through telephone with a friend 20 miles away. My wife also saw it. Pulsating multicolored lights stationary for over 1 hour. Looked as if lights were circling around it. At times looked as if 2 other white only lights pulsating with it all sepperated by maybe 2-3 miles. Other lights were not present very long. Went inside, came back out and it had traveled exactly parallel NNW and stayed stationary at that point for 30 min. Tried to video but as I live in town, lights on the ground made it impossible to see with camera."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"08/23/2011 10:30 UTC","Country":"United States"}
