I know what I saw and it was real.whatever it was."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Florida","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in North Palm Beach","There were no other sightings in North Palm Beach on or around September 10th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"09/10/2010 02:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25645.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25645.html"],"Case Number":"25645","Latitude":"26.8192","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
