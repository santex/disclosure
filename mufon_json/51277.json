Iwas talking with my girlfriend on the phone when a red light(object)I don't know raced across my line of sight from east to west and crossed the horizon in about the time it takes to say one thousand one. Then it was gone. The object(light) made no sound, there was no arc to it; it moved horizontally to the horizon.No lights pulsated, there were no running lights like a plane. If you look on a map, the distance from Ashland to the Barksdale area is appox. 1-2 miles across Lake Superior. This thing covered that distance in about the blink of the eye. That is about it. I do a lot of night photography and I was in aviation when I was in the military. I 've seen strange things before but nothing this fast."],"Summary":"covered vast distance in very short time span","Latitude":"46.602043","Object Shape":"Egg, Oval","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-90.878178","City":"Ashland","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.602043,+-90.878178(51277)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51277) map </A>","Case Number":"51277","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/02/2013 09:52 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51277.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51277.html"],"Region":"Wisconsin","Object Features":"None, Other","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Ashland","There were no other sightings in Ashland on or around October 1st 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
