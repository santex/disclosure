I was unable to get in touch with her do to having a baby . Just want to say i believe your organization doesn't do what is needed to get the information you desire as ufo investigators. I deal with these visitors all my life and for your Representative to cancel our meetings because I wouldn't hurry up is ludicrous. I could show you things you only see in pictures from time to time. I see them every day. I will not respond to any of you after this. I dont need to convince you of anything. I live it . If you want to learn something see things for yourself heres your opportunity. I will not extend my hand again."],"Latitude":"42.210404","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.576342"}
