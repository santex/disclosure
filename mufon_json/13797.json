Only my hallway light was on, all of a sudden a light came through my window and my girlfriend who was talking stopped in mid word and stood perfectly still, I couldnt even feel air in the room it was as if I was standing in a picture. The only noise was a high pitched tone. i ran over to my girlfriend after staring at her and the light coming into the room, when i touched her the light receded back through the window, and everything was normal, she finished what she was saying but she was shocked that i had appeared in front of her. I drug her to the window and we seen something sitting in the sky not even 200 feet outside the window toward the sky. Its zipped off. There was even someone outside talking on her cell phone across the parking lot, but my girlfriend and i both seen it. Everyone else acts normal like nothing happened.
