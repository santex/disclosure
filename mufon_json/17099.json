It was after sunset and it was the brightest area in the sky at the time. A cloudy sky at the time did not appear to disrupt the beam, and the light faded away as the clouds cleared that spot. It was insight and did not flicker or change appearance for the 15 minutes I observed it. we live not far from a Hospital and frequently have helicopters taking patients from there to Melbourne the light was as bright as the searchlight they use but it remained stationary. I hope someone else witnessed this other than my wife and I."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"Australia","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Victoria","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"144.96593","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Date Submitted":"05/23/2009 08:15 UTC","Latitude":"-37.806587","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-37.806587,+144.96593(17099)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17099) map </A>","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Melbourne","There were no other sightings in Melbourne on or around May 23rd 2009"],"Log Number":"AU-05242009-0002"}
