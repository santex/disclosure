I watched the satellite move in an east-west direction at a steady pace for a few seconds. Then it stopped. The sky was clear and I did not ever lose sight of the object. Had I not been watching it as it moved through the sky, I would have assumed it was just a star. It's color and intensity were very much the same as most of the stars in that area of the sky. I carefully marked its position relative to the stars around it and watched it closely. After about 10 minutes, something moving around in the woods by my house caused my dog to start barking so we went back inside. I checked as I went inside, and it still had not moved. I have seen some odd things I can't explain before. I have always been curious, but this is the first time seeing something has bothered me. I was a little spooked afterward, and had an uneasy, jumpy feeling the rest of the night."],"Region":"Kentucky","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.185443,+-83.475334(39398)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39398) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"38.185443"}
