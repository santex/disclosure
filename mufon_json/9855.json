{"Summary":"It was bright yellow, and very high and large for its alttatude. It flew from west to east in an unusual flight path then it zipped away over the highlands.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting on A bench at work texting my girlfriend, when i looked up and saw the light. the first thing in my mind was \"there is no flight path there,what is that?\" I could tell it was at the hight of jet liner, very high. But I coud see it was very large and A dull bright yellow. It was traveling very fast for how far up it was. I stopped texting and called my girlfriend and told her what I was seeing, because i knew it was unusual, how it came in from over the ocean and reached way over the hills in what had to be much less than five minutes. The most strange part about what I saw was the way the light seemed to zoom off towards the east sky and up in an instant out of sight. I use to work on A marine corp air station and have seen A lot of aircraft in flight, but this didn't act like anything i've ever seen before."],"Longitude":"-124.07485","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Arcata","Date Submitted":"07/31/0001 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Arcata","There were no other sightings in Arcata on or around July 29th 0001"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.875077","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03062008-0003","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.875077,+-124.07485(9855)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9855) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9855.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9855.html"],"Case Number":"9855","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/31/0001 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown"}
