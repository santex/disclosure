These were followed by 3 other lights (also orange) in a straight line following the first two. The motion was steady and in an exact line. My battery on my phone ran out (typical!) so I could not get any video evidence. This must have been seen by others as the local public houses were just emptying. There was no sound whatsoever from the objects. As an avid ufo watcher, I have not seen anything like this before (although I have seen a ufo about 15 years ago). It seemed as if the objects were directly over Oxford, as I was observing from Kidlington (about 5 miles away). Feel free to e-mail me as I would really like to know more about this."],"trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Oxford","There were no other sightings in Oxford on or around August 24th 2008"],"Region":"England","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
