This part of the city is on the border of Oklahoman County & Canadian County. As we were just enjoying the evening, we saw a sudden concentrated flash that was seen in my peripheral vision. As soon as I looked up, I saw a very faint, and very small (as being far away?) follow and suddenly disappear into space. I had no idea what to think as what it was because it happened in a matter of seconds. One of my friends that I was with saw exactly what I did, but the other two who were facing the other direction just saw the flash. It was not a big one that covered the sky, but it was about how big a camera flash is, just up in the air and farther away. From where I was sitting and where it was, it more than likely happened over Canadian County. I have never seen anything like this before in my life and my friend who saw it agreed with me. We have no idea what it was and it was just very peculiar."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-97.754784","City":"Yukon","Log Number":"US-05262010-0006","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Flash","Date Submitted":"05/26/2010 04:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
