{"Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"07/14/2010 09:59 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving toward Bexley Square when I saw the object in the air near Bexley. The object was moving away from downtown Columbus when it suddenly started going in the other direction toward downtown Columbus. It looked like it had some kind of landing gear, but it was not moving like a helicopter and seemed rather small. The sun was hitting the object from the opposite direction from my vantage point so it looked dark. I did not know what the object was when I first spotted it, but I knew that it was not a man made object the moment it suddenly started moving in the opposite direction. I lost sight of the object as it moved toward the sun which was setting. I was surprised to see something like this near a major city, but perhaps it was trying to mostly hide itself in the sun's glare."],"Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24520.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24520.html"],"trends":["There have been 70 other sightings in Columbus","There were no other sightings in Columbus on or around July 14th 2010"],"Region":"Ohio","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.964316,+-82.989764(24520)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24520) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-07142010-0023","Case Number":"24520","Date of the Event":"07/14/2010 08:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-82.989764","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Was hovering in one direction.
