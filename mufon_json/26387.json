It had just rained and you could barely see twenty feet in front of you with your headlights on. I was driving from Jaffrey(New Hampshire) to Rindge (New Hampshire), on my way to bring something to a friend of mine in Rindge. As I was driving by Pool Pond(a lake on the edge of rt. 202 in Rindge)I noticed a light out of the corner of my eye, and the top right corner of my windsheild. It was shining through the thick fog over the pond and rose over the tree tops and looked to be going about thirty mph or so(hard to tell)But it was long enough for me to know it was not an airplane or a star. It was a sphere of light that just looked very abnormal to me. I think it was a large object because it was approximately a half mile away. But the circumference of the light was an inch wide, from my view. I haven't seen anything like it. I was confused to what it could have been. I only saw it moving for a few seconds but it just disapeared into nothing after i saw it."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Latitude":"42.751196","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City"}
