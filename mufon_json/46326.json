{"Longitude":"-121.49328","divs":["Sighting DetailsMyself and a friend were outside in my backyard working. It had become dark outside by the time we were done. As we talked there was a sudden bright red flash of light that lit up the sky facing west. About 5 minutes went by and there was another bright red flash like the first one then another bright red flash about a min later. The flashes were very bright and filled the whole skyline to the west."],"trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Sacramento","There were no other sightings in Sacramento on or around March 19th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Flash","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"03/20/2013 02:57 UTC","Log Number":"US-03202013-0002","Country":"United States","Latitude":"38.589002","Object Flight Path":"N/A","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46326.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46326.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Summary":"Bright red flashes of light that lit up the whole sky","Date of the Event":"03/19/2013 08:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.589002,+-121.49328(46326)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46326) map </A>","Region":"California","City":"Sacramento","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"46326","Source":"MUFON"}
