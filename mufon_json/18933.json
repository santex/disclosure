I saw what I that was a star but is was larger, not quite as bright and just above the tree line. I thought , that is not right, there is no star supposed to be there. Within a few seconds it moved across the skyline to the southeast and then went behind a tree line where I could not see it. I see Airplane���s all the time with their blinking lights approach the Airport about 10 miles away and this was no plane. It moved a distance in a split second that I have watched a plane take several minutes to move the same distance. I have been very nervous and kind feel like something or somebody was watching me. I don���t like this feeling."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Birmingham","Log Number":"US-08282009-0014","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Birmingham","There were no other sightings in Birmingham on or around August 26th 2009"],"Longitude":"-86.79475","Date of the Event":"08/26/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.528451","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.528451,+-86.79475(18933)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18933) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None"}
