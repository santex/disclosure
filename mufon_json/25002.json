It was a full moon, there was some haze around the moon but other than that a perfectly clear night. It was ten p.m. when all of the sudden a 'classic' saucer shaped object appeared to the right of the moon with reddish lights, it 'came on' and stayed for about 15 seconds then as if someone had turned off a light it went off. We all shouted, 'What Was That'? There were no planes, boats, helicopters or people in the air or on the beach. We watched the sky and about 15 minutes later something else appeared further North, this looked triangular in shape with colored lights and just like the first ufo, this one came on and within a few seconds looked like someone had turned off a light, it was gone. We all shouted 'There it is'! We watched the sky for two hours more and nothing else appeared, no planes, helicopters ships were in sight. We did not get a response when we emailed the local police. This is still an unknown."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Country":"United States","City":"Emerald Isle","Region":"North Carolina","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.68427,+-76.947496(25002)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25002) map </A>"}
