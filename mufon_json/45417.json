I tried locating my phone to grab a picture and had to pull over into the median. When I finally was able to take a picture, they had disbursed in different directions and were floating around like fire flies. I then, started heading back home and lost them in the cloud cover as I drew closer to my home. Im kind if freaked out right now. You can view the picture online on my FaceBook page Jennifer Bushman (the one feeding the prairie dogs) Thanks!
