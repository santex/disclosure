{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsAugust 2008. Have seen a number of UFOs over the past 50 years. Have also had the misfortune to see a few of the beings that apparently go along with them. In August of last year I encountered a being unlike I had ever seen before. Was late in the afternoon, I was in the kitchen getting a soda when I looked up and out into the hallway, in the open bedroom door was an entity that literally made my heart skip a beat. It was a little taller than I am, looked to be a reptile of some sort, had bright yellow eyes with vertical pupils. It was wearing what appeared to be a one piece dark blue jumpsuit. There was some kind of insignia on the lower arm. I could not take my eyes away from its eyes. It seemed to have an expression of disdain or disgust or possibly anger; hard to tell but it did not give off a good feeling. We were maybe 8 ft. apart and just continued to stare at one another. I finally lowered my head and closed my eyes and when I looked up it was gone. Needless to say, I slept with most of the lights on that night. This was not a pleasant experience"],"Country":"United States","Summary":"Angry alien ?","Latitude":"35.963768","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/05/2008 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"18053","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18053.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18053.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.963768,+-83.916539(18053)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18053) map </A>","Region":"Tennessee","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-83.916539","trends":["There have been 50 other sightings in Knoxville","There were no other sightings in Knoxville on or around August 5th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"08/05/2008 12:00 UTC","City":"Knoxville","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07132009-0018","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
