Told husband that I thought it was a UFO - have never seen anything like that - still yet high in the sky. There were no clouds in the sky and I thought it might be a tiny bit of cloud at first until I looked closer and saw it to be still and a strange color. It appeared to be coppery glow like to me. He didn't even look as he was driving and didn't believe me anyway. It unnerved me and I thought about it tonight and checked Mufon to see if anyone else saw the same thing as me. Pleased to see that I wasn't the only one to see it."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 43 other sightings in Arlington","There was one other sighting in Arlington on or around January 27th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35316.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35316.html"],"Case Number":"35316","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City"}
