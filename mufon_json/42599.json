I text my daughter about it! Next night about the same time went out to smoke and saw same object to the west, they are pretty high in the horizon. Wasn't sure it was the same until it moved, called my grandchildren out and we whatched it slowly move to the south east then stoped and suddenly got brighter and shot up into space and as it did so it turned to an orange ball just before it vanished, we saw a fast moving jet shortly after headed towards the exit spot. There was no objects blocking our line of sight, it makes absolutely no noise and I live by an airport and know very well the sound and looks of planes at night. Two nights later I went out again about the same time just in time to see it to the north get brighter and shoot into space. when it shoots into space it moves at a rapid rate of speed it only takes a split second, when it travels across the sky it's slow and almost as if it's floating and does change speeds, but always maintains the bright star like apperance, it is able to change directions suddenly, not sure of the distance away but it's up there. A week later I found out that some one I know that live a few miles away has seen the same object with her twin sister, she had told me the story before I told her what I saw. Have not seen it since that last week in August"],"Date Submitted":"09/16/2012 05:07 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/20/2012 10:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","Summary":"Saw what looked like a bright star just stationary, it went sharpe left down then off to right, two other sightings as well","Region":"Oregon"}
