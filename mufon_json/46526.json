{"Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking my dog in the vacinity of Golden and Battlefield Streets by an apartment complet in Springfield, Mo. when I saw 6 yellow-orange orbs flying west to east. There was also a pulsating red light either on top or in the middle. I'm not good at judging distance but they were too far away to be able to see the craft. They formed a V then ascended into the sky till they disappeared. 14 more orbs followed, randomly spaced out and followed the same flight path. Someone else in the apartment complex saw them too. At one point, a plane flew at the same altitude but in the opposite direction. I've never seen a UFO before and I'm not sure what to make of it. I emailed a local news station and they said they heard on a traffic scanner someone reporting it to the police."],"Region":"Missouri","Date Submitted":"04/01/2013 04:38 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/31/2013 09:45 UTC","Case Number":"46526","Latitude":"37.158908","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46526.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46526.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04012013-0009","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-93.316273","City":"Springfield","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Springfield","There were no other sightings in Springfield on or around March 31st 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.158908,+-93.316273(46526)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46526) map </A>","Summary":"I saw 20 yellow-orange orbs traveling west to east then ascend until they couldn't be seen anymore.
