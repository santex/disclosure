{"Longitude":"-86.782853","Case Number":"15045","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy fianc��� and I were driving home from work, around 10:55 pm central time (Nashville, Tn- Antioch to be exact), when he tapped me and pointed to an object in the sky. At first, he thought it was a helicopter or a plane, as we are very close to the airport. As we approached our stoplight (the corner of Murfreesboro Road and Nashboro Blvd.) we noticed how large and how bright the object actually was. It was obvious from how low it was in the sky and the area where it was that this was NO helicopter. We turned down our road, Nashboro Blvd, and the object seemed to almost hover in the sky, making a descent behind a massive abandoned house, and landing in what we guessed was an open field. It was fairly close above us and it appeared much larger than a plane. It was flat bottomed, noiseless, and, like previously stated, seemed to almost hover like a flying car might. The lights were so bright, even from a distance, that it gave the impression of halogens. After this, we drove around the area (down Smith Springs Road, Bell Road, etc..) seeing if we could get a better view of the field. It was very obstructed so we could not get a view from our car. As we were driving down Smith Springs, however, my fianc��� noticed an object shoot up, at a strange angle, and seem to bolt across the sky. I did not notice it until he pointed it out, very far from the field, where we assumed it had just been. Though we had not seen the field, the area seemed to be artificially illuminated by some outside light source. For about 30-40 minutes we drove around, making u-turns and trying our best to follow the object when we could find it in our view. We lost it a few times, but we seemed to always find it, hovering around the same general area. To me, watching it hover, it almost looked like a search craft, like a craft looking for something. On our final drive down Nashboro Blvd, it was the closest we had seen it. The sensation was that of the craft moving towards us, descending so low as if it might just graze the car. Once again, we noticed a hovering, a searching, yet NO sound. It passed over the area, once again, and headed in the direction of the field. My fianc���, with his head out of the car door, snapped a few pictures, as it passed by. The actions of the object can only be described as smooth, fluid, and fast"],"trends":["There have been 72 other sightings in Nashville","There were 2 other sightings in Nashville on or around January 21st 2009"],"Latitude":"36.17358","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.17358,+-86.782853(15045)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15045) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15045.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15045.html"],"Log Number":"US-01222009-0004","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Tennessee","Date of the Event":"01/21/2009 10:55 UTC","City":"Nashville","Summary":"Craft seen hovering low over populated country area.","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"01/21/2009 10:55 UTC","Tags":"City"}
