Circle or sphere glowing a dull red, hovering in place. As I stopped and stared at it, the red glow dimmed away, leaving the craft looking a grey color. It slowly and steadily drifted over all the apartment complexes on my road, wobbling slightly (best way I can describe it) as it went, until it was out of sight. I tried to take photos and video with my phone but it's a total piece. Zoomed one picture where *something* showed up, but it looks really bad."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-93.227826","Country":"United States","Region":"Missouri","trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Springfield","There were no other sightings in Springfield on or around July 26th 2012"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Springfield"}
