In N.E.PA. For anyone whose intersested take pics on partly cloudy days. And youll see little flashes like diamonds,once you see the flash start taking pics.You will not see until reveiw. Sometimes they are white, or dark round objects but they are always there. Maybe drones from bigger crafts or they come from space,underground. Or maybe they are alive themselves. Im not trying to tell anyone what they are,but i know that they are not something i could see with out the help of a camera. If someone with a high speed camera did this just for a couple days they would(maybe) get something.Thanx happy hunting!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.247395,+-75.877478(46749)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46749) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere","City":"Wilkes-Barre","Date of the Event":"04/06/2013 07:10 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
