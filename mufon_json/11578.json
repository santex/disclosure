As i lie there on my back way out over the tree tops i saw what at the moment seemed to be a super bright star. As I looked at it, it jumped probably 100 miles almost instantly then jumped in a different direction. I felt bad waking anyone up so i let the people sleep. Before long i heard some people a few rows down talking about this thing that would jump in seemingly random directions every five seconds or so. so i walked to them and watched it with them. We concluded it was very far away probably 100 to 150 miles away and was moving far to fastto be a helicopter which is what they thought it was at first sight. After probably half a hour it just dissapeared instantly gone like it had never been there."],"Latitude":"44.059109","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","City":"Eugene","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"11578","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Multiple People saw what at first appeared to be a star suddenly move and stop at super speeds","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-123.078004"}
