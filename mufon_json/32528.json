When military aircraft (F-16's) approached it (I estimate about 12 aircraft) it disappeared. When the jets were in the distance it appeared again and we noticed the jets turning back towards the object once again. The sky was filled with contrails!I would like to know if or how many people sighted this. I contacted Bpt. police and they said one other person had reported unusual activity in the sky.We had to exit the highway and could not observe it anymore after that. If anyone else saw this would you please contact me. This is'nt the first time for me."],"Summary":"orange teardrop with bright white orb apparently coming out of it. F16's were in pursuit.
