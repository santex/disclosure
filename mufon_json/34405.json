Almost daily this object can be seen from my front yard, it also comes at the same time every time. I decided to look at the object through a telescope. After viewing it from my telescope it was apparent to me and my family that it was no ordinary object. I feel this is a site that I have never experienced before. Every time I lose site of it, it descends below the tree line."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12302011-0019","Date of the Event":"11/28/2011 05:15 UTC","Region":"New York","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.457568,+-74.51368(34405)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34405) map </A>","Case Number":"34405","City":"Middletown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34405.html"],"trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Middletown","There were 2 other sightings in Middletown on or around November 28th 2011"],"Summary":"Its a bright pulsating light, with light within light..a ring of fire.","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"12/30/2011 09:28 UTC","Longitude":"-74.51368"}
