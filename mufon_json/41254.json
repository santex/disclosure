At 2:37am (according to my phone) I noticed a bright orange glow over and beyond the ridge to the north, northwest. At first I thought it was a plane or helicopter due to the nearby airport. But it had no strobe, wingtip, or landing lights. I watched the object fly in a straight line, with occasional decending, towards the southeast. (My direction). I watched it for about thirty seconds when it suddenly disappeared. There was no cloud cover at all."]}
