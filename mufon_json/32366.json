We saw this object that had shape of stealth bomber that had green and white lights hovering over the hiway. At first I told my husband and children that I thought it was a blimp, but as we got closer it was doing weird maneuvers. We turned around to get closer and by the time we got close enough it shot if like a rocket. There was another object in sky that it flew over and the light on it was a white very bright light. I then called my father(retired navy) to ask him if stealth bombers hover and have gen and white less and he said no. he said that it might be a harrin. So I looked it up and it didn't look like it either. So what was it that I saw???"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Object Features":"Wings","Date of the Event":"10/04/2011 08:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32366.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32366.html"],"Case Number":"32366","City":"Rocheport","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
