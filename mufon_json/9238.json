First Street. I noticed a dimly light object the size of a small Winnebago camper was about 20 over the roof of a house on right-hand side of E. Johnson between North 1st and North 2nd Street about 100 yards from where I was stopped at the light. It was evenly and dimly lit to a nondescript gray especially on its belly and was slowly moving down the row of houses traveling toward me to the south. I watched it while I approached and subsequently waited for the light to change. I thought maybe the police had a helicopter out looking for a burglary suspect that someone reported. Things didn't add up. There was no spotlight scan the bushes below for a bandit. There was no other lighting on it; frankly I couldn't tell where the top of it was. Most helicopters have lighting on or about the base at the center of the rotating the blades. There were no lights to indicate a cockpit. And there was no noise. I shut the heater off in the car and listened - it was silent. It had since left the row of rooftops and had slowly started to make its way across Johnson Street, heading toward the southern portion of the old Mautz paint factory. The light changed to green and I started to pull away from the stop light toward it. When the object was over the boulevard my theory that it was a helicopter pretty much failed. For one thing, if it was helicopter, being that low to the ground its downdraft should have kicked up some of the snow and buffeted the small shrubs - neither one happened. And if it was helicopter I certainly should have heard it now as I was approaching it and soon to be practically underneath it. As I went to pass under it I noticed a large seam on its belly that looked like a \"T\" with the horizontal portion of the \"T\" being at the end of the object that appeared to be the \"front\" (as defined by the direction it was moving). About the time I realized it wasn't normal I was just about to pass under it and sure enough I did. While briefly passing underneath, I remember feeling odd, almost like I had an overwhelming urge to fidget and I did awkwardly rumpled myself in my seat. I was slowly starting to freak out and question my sanity at the same time as I continued driving north when I noticed another car. It was traveling south and approaching the boulevard. I remember the car being a tan 4 door and most of all I remember the guy was driving with his face practically against the windshield and craning his neck to look up. He saw it. From the street light I could tell he had short brown hair and was Caucasian. When I got home I was completely activated. I wanted to wake up everybody in the house and tell them what I saw, but didn't. The next morning the news had a report of a UFO over by Milwaukee Street that had all but landed in the street while a police officer looked on. But it was earlier in the day. And so, I guess I'm nuts too. Whatever,��� it was what it was and I���d give anything to talk to that guy in the other car."],"Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-89.39528","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9238.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9238.html"],"Region":"Wisconsin","Log Number":"US-01252008-0008","Latitude":"43.074142","City":"Madison","Object Features":"Other","Tags":"City","Summary":"Slow, low and quiet it traveled down the street over the roof tops","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","trends":["There have been 23 other sightings in Madison","There were no other sightings in Madison on or around February 1st 1984"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"9238","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00"}
