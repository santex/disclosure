I was BBQ'ing and looked up after a few seconds and noticed was looked like a long cyliner shaped object with NO wings flying at a fairly fast rate in the clear sky. It was traveling South to North passing over the Woodinville, WA area. I never changed path or altitude for as far as I could see it. Again it had no wings, it had a reflective character to it and silent. I know there have been some reports of many orbs on July 4th in the area, but was curious if anyone knows what I saw. I typically see aiplanes fly East to West at a fairly low altitude always emitting noise. This was a non-typical flight path and silent."],"Summary":"Shiny non-winged object flying South-North in a straight path Seattle area","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07052012-0089","City":"Woodinville","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40265.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40265.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.158568","Case Number":"40265","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Woodinville","There were no other sightings in Woodinville on or around July 4th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.755265,+-122.158568(40265)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40265) map </A>","Region":"Washington","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 06:00 UTC","Latitude":"47.755265"}
