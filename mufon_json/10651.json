But was taken almost imediatlly after I lost sight of the origanal object. The picture was of an object traveling from south to north. It seem intresting enough to post as it did not quite look like a jet. And it was at a high altitude. I am going to take some pictures of jets with cem-trails and see if it is just my camera making them look like that or maybe she did take a picture of something different."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"10651","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-05042008-0004","Tags":"City","Summary":"McKinney Re - white sphere traveling from north to south","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in McKinney","There was one other sighting in McKinney on or around May 2nd 2008"]}
