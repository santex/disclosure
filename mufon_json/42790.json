I had been out there about 30 min. when I saw a V shaped object traveling very slow and just above the tree tops, moving from north to east in a straight line. I walked out on to the lawn and watched it until I could not see it any longer. I don't know if it shot off, or went invisible. I just could'nt see it. It was gone. I felt very scared and I went back to the porch sat down and started to pray. I then felt some type of liquid hit my forhead. When I reached up and touched the spot it felt sticky. I went inside and looked in the mirror and it looked like blood. This is the second time I've seen a UFO. The first time I didn't report it. I should have because it was very eventful, I was too afraid of what people would think back then."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"42790","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42790.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42790.html"],"City":"Broken Arrow","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
