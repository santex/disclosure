I drove around a bend in the highway and saw all of these stars in the sky, one was brighter then the rest almost like a planet, then it winked out like someone turned off a switch. I asked my wife, \"did you see that?\" and she said \"what?\", and I told her a star had just winked out, she said \"really?\". I told her it was just there now it's gone. I tried looking at the stars to see more but with the slick roads and deer I just drove on. I thought to myself \"did I really see that?\", but I had, I knew I did."],"Longitude":"-120.186196","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Star winks out","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27470.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27470.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/19/2011 12:00 UTC"}
