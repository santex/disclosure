In parking lot looked up and saw 3 circle like objects. The color started off like a pinkish red. Disappeared before our eyes. Started driving home and spotted 2 of them. I grabbed camera and got out of car. I went to take picture when 3rd one reappeared. It was bigger and looked like a fireball. It was moving faster as though it was trying to catch up with other two. Lost behind some trees, we decided to drive up hill. Tried to video tape again until they disappeared. At one point video taped them in same spot for up to 3 minutes with no movement (hovering) Later at home watched video and noticed something my plain eyes didn't see. Orbs or other circle objects flew right inside the other circle object. It was very odd. I'd like to mention that it was an almost full moon, a few obvious stars in the sky but the rest was as clear as can be. It was not a plane. It didn't always move in straight path. It made no noise. It wasn't a meteror, I've seen those.
