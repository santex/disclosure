I was a kid age 13, I was sleeping outside like I always did, I really love sleeping outside on the lawn. Anyhow I woke up about 3 am and saw an object in the air approximately less than 500 ft above me, the object was traveling NE, it had no sound. It was a triangle shape with three fire holes at each point of a triangle, I felt like it was another craft of the Air force, I never saw anything like that to this day. I saw it fly over the mountains, it was a full moon that night, a few minutes later the moon began to be bright orange color. I told my parents what happened that night, they just blew me off. If anyone has ever seen an object such as this leave a post."],"Object Features":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-05102013-0003","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Cedar City","There were no other sightings in Cedar City on or around June 11th 1993"],"Latitude":"37.685247","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.685247,+-113.060853(47310)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47310) map </A>","Summary":"flew overhead in shape of a triangle with three fire holes at each point of the triangle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"47310","Longitude":"-113.060853"}
