This morning, I was looking high in the south and noticed 3 faint stars. Then I noticed that 1 of the stars was moving. I have seen many satellites and this was traveling far too slow, but if it was a plane it was traveling extremely high and fast. After watching it travel due south for a short time, it flashed with a brilliant white light and went dark. I continued watching for about 30 seconds and there was a second flash of light like the first, but it had moved off of the course it had been traveling on, a bit to the south-east. I tried watching more but I lost line of sight from the rooftop. About a month ago, I spotted the same thing. Probably something military, but I don't know."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/24/2010 05:55 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26728.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26728.html"],"trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Medford","There were no other sightings in Medford on or around November 24th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Medford","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Unusual lights in sky.","Date Submitted":"11/24/2010 09:30 UTC"}
