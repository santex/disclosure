I was at a friends house. So I started driving home. There's a stretch of 6 miles between my town and the town I was in. Its all open fields except for two house before you hit the fields. There was a full moon out, and I know there was one house left before there were no more houses. I noticed a bright light shining on top of a tree. I thought there's no telephone pole there. I slowed down to a stop, I could see the shape very well. There was no one on the road. The light turned 90 degrees. So I sat there and watched the light. It was about 60 yards away. It turned and started going across the road I was on, at tree top level. It had a blue and red light, one on each side, with a large white spot light shining on the ground as it went across a field. It went very slow and just kept cruising at tree top level going across the field. It wasn't a helicoptor or plane. It was sitting still above a tree. The next day I went to work and a co-worker said he saw the ship going across the field."],"Date Submitted":"10/13/1978 10:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.30898,+-76.593301(7088)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7088) map </A>","Case Number":"7088","Date of the Event":"10/13/1978 10:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7088.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7088.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
