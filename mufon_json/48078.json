Thought it was a plane then the object became brighter. A plane at first then realized it wasn't. Passed right over me and then I said to myself, I better get this on video. Ran into the house. Large ball of white light Didn't seem like plane, no blinking lights that I could notice and no distincive shape NO SOUND! Moving fast, southwest to east Hard to say the height of the object, but similar to normal height that a plane would be flying, where you can make out all of the details of the plane Video footage taken on iphone. The footage that I have is after it passed over me. At first I thought it was a star and then I noticed movement and it came closer and got bigger. I then thought this has to be a plane, until it got brighter and was making no sound. You can usually hear a plane either as it's passing over or after it has past overhead. This made no sound at all. It was weird. I ran into the house to get my iphone and caught it going away from me. UNREAL! 4th sighting in my area since last year!
