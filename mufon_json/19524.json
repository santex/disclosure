I did not sleep to well and was restless all night I woke up and looked at the clock it was 4:00 a.m. I got up out of bed and looked out the window and marveled at all the stars so clear in the sky (Living in the city I dont see that very much)thats when I noticed a cone shaped object, it was stationary and seemed to have a cloud around it and also a hint of lights which seemed obscured. It was the strangest thing I ever seen. I knew something was there but I couldnt quite make it out. Every time my eyes glanced away from it for a second and then came back to try an focus better was this hint of lights around the cone shape object. I must have watch for about 5 minutes or so and at no time did it move. I was getting a little nervous about what I was seeing I didnt want to watch anymore and tried to go back to sleep. All day long Ive wondered what it was that I saw."],"Longitude":"-74.183064","Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Object Shape":"Cone","Latitude":"41.339689","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-09202009-0064","Case Number":"19524","Summary":"Cone shaped object , stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19524.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19524.html"],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around September 20th 2009"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
