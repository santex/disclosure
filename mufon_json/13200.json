{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"13200","Tags":"City","divs":["sighting detailsi was at home playing football in the back garden, afterwards i went to lay down on the grass, as i was relaxing something had caught my eye in the sky. so it got me looking up at sky it was quite clear sunny day with some clouds about, as i was trying to find what got my attention, eventualy i spotted this object by the way it was flashing in and out i guess thats what caught my eye in the beginning. it looked to be shiney\\metallic object i would estimate the size probaly 10-20ft across and the distance it was at i would say it was about few hundred or several hundred feet up in the sky (hard to estimate its size and distance) but it was in view range. anyway this object kept on blinking in and out of sequence, like it was on a timer, it was kind of hard to keep a track of it as it was flashing in and out for every half a second to say about a second i would say. it kept doing this for the majority of the sighting, which lasted for about 10-15mmins. i thought is this object flashing because the sun was reflecting off it, or is this thing actualy doing it, this object looked to have some sort of controlled appearance to it, like an intelligence, simular to what a satelite does. also what i found strange was the actual object it self, the shape of it was so unusual, it got me thinking is this object only showing a small part of the shape to something which was there. i have no clue what i witnessed but it was nothing i have ever seen before, at the time i was realy baffled and probaly looked to have a confused look on my face(scratching my head sort of thing). i lost track of the object as i went to go get my binoclures, i came back, and i couldnt find this thing."],"Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.528151,+-86.79401(13200)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13200) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"07/13/2008 02:20 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder, Flash, Square, Rectagular, Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13200.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13200_submitter_file1__UFOobject.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13200.html"],"Latitude":"33.528151","Region":"Alabama","trends":["There have been 48 other sightings in Birmingham","There were no other sightings in Birmingham on or around July 13th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/13/2008 02:20 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"A shiney metallic longish rectangler/triangler flashing sequence object","Longitude":"-86.79401","City":"Birmingham","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"GB-10242008-0003"}
