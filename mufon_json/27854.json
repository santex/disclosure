I caught sight of what looked like a jet at aproximately 30,000 ft. But as I looked at it, I realized this was not a jet because it had no wings. I watched it a few minutes before it vanished in the sky. This is the second time I have seen this type of UAP. It was shiny metallic with sunlight reflecting on it. Its body was long like a jet. There was no vapor trail. I was in my car driving so I could not detect any noise."],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Other","Longitude":"-104.977713","Latitude":"39.743544","Log Number":"US-02162011-0009","Object Features":"Other","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.743544,+-104.977713(27854)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27854) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Colorado","Date Submitted":"02/16/2011 12:32 UTC","City":"Denver","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"27854","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around February 16th 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27854.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27854.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
