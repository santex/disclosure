At first I thought they were landing lights of jets coming towards us, but as we watched, they became bright orange and fiery, like the exhaust from a rocket launch. The skies were absolutely clear, and the full moon was lighting up everything so we could see that there was no smoke or contrail coming from the objects. We watched as the objects appeared to go straight up, then turn in different directions (toward the east and south), as they appeared to leave the atmosphere. The objects were about the size of half the diameter of a penny at arms length and were about two pennies apart. The observation lasted maybe two minutes."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25611.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25611.html"],"Region":"California","Case Number":"25611","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-118.459048","Summary":"Two fireballs seen south of Santa Monica","Log Number":"US-09282010-0019"}
