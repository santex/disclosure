Five extremely bright lights in a horizontal row very big only saw them for a second or a second and a half. I could not pull over because I was in my car. When I went down a side street the trees were to tall and I could not find it. I would like to know if anyone else in the area saw this as well. I just can't believe no one else saw it and I would really like to know what you find out. I would estimate from first light to the last light it has to be hundreds of feet long because it was over a mile away. I couldn't believe what I was seeing."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-71.191035","Object Shape":"Circle","Date Submitted":"04/09/2013 06:45 UTC","Latitude":"42.185711","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Norwood","There were no other sightings in Norwood on or around March 31st 2013"],"City":"Norwood","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Massachusetts","Date of the Event":"03/31/2013 06:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.185711,+-71.191035(46693)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46693) map </A>","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-04092013-0012","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None"}
