It suddenly turned out into space, and disappeared. It was about 600 yards away. Three days later I was walking near a close by field, and I saw it in the north taking up a large part of the sky. It went along at about 35 mph for 7 seconds then it turned straight upward disappearing into space. Its vapourish tail completely followed it into space, leaving no trace. I saw this object two other times, and once just a month ago outside my living room window where in that same hour I saw two other types of UFOs. One was an airplane looking thing, which was 50 yards from my apartment, and made no noise. It had a very big tail wing. And it was orange and black. I saw it for 8 seconds. And I saw a small dot of white light that would flare out very bright then dim then bright. It traveled at about 10 mph going eastward. Thank you."],"trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Garden Grove","There were no other sightings in Garden Grove on or around November 30th 1996"]}
