{"Tags":"City","City":"Winchester","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Log Number":"US-12232008-0002","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["sighting details this is a copy of my original report, made on ufoinfo.com - i think i submitted it the day after the sighting occurred: \"ufoinfo sighting form report location: winchester, virginia date: march 9th, 2008 time: 10:35 pm number of witnesses: 1 number of objects: 1 shape of objects: spherical, star-like weather conditions: clear, calm, 40's description: i was on the porch of my home last night when i observed a yellowish-white star-like object. it was initially about 45 degrees above the horizon and moving toward my position from the northeast. we are under a major flight corridor here, and we see lots of commercial aircraft. in fact, there were several typical aircraft in the sky at the time - but this was definitely not one of them. it was larger and more brilliant than any of the stars in the sky. the color was very odd, similar to the \"creamy yellow\" of the holmes comet which appeared several months ago. altitude seemed very high, perhaps 30-40,000 feet. speed appeared slow, but at that altitude might have been around 200 mph or more. as it approached from the northeast on a straight line of flight, it reached a position about 75 degrees off the horizon when it instantaneously slowed to about half it's former speed, almost as if it was deciding where to go next. it then turned from it's southwest path and took a new heading directly to the west, resuming its former speed. the most remarkable thing was that this did not seem to be a light that was attached to some object, but rather an entire object emitting light. after the object made it's turn and it began to move away from my position toward the west, the light it emitted seemed to \"flicker\" several times - ever so briefly appearing red\\white, then returning to it's former coloration and intensity, which it maintained during the entire 3-4 minute sighting. i've never seen nor reported anything like this before.\" another similar sighting from woodbridge virginia, describing \"four or five yellowish-white lights hovering low in the skyline, clustered together\", was reported to the same source from an incident on march 5th\\6th of this year. finally, a report was made on this site of an incident that occurred on december 7th near danville, virginia describing a \"yellowish-white short streak in the sky\" and a \"very bright rod-shaped object\" with a \"yellowish-white radiance or cloud\" surrounding it. i'm sure i saw another incident reported somewhere that described a yellowish-white object sighted near roanoke this summer, but i was unable to relocate the information in order to reference it here. but cmon . . . how many objects - of any kind - have you heard described as being \"yellowish-white\" in color ?? the color was the key, because it was so unusual that it attracted my attention to the object and caused me to observe it. the bizarre angular movements were observed as a result. could it be that several complete strangers in the state of virginia are just coincidentally reporting odd aerial objects using such an unusual color descriptor as \"yellowish-white\" in 2008 ?? maybe 2009 will tell."],"Summary":"Not Provided","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Winchester","There were no other sightings in Winchester on or around March 9th 2008"],"Region":"Virginia","Latitude":"39.18566","Sighting Duration":"00:03:30","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Longitude":"-78.163334","Date Submitted":"03/09/2008 10:35 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14498.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14498.html"],"Date of the Event":"03/09/2008 10:35 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.18566,+-78.163334(14498)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14498) map </A>","Case Number":"14498"}
