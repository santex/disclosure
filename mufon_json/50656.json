Then I saw a bright white light moving slowly towards the north, it lasted only a couple seconds and disappeared. At first I thought it was a shooting star but thought it was moving very slow (as I have viewed many shooting stars in my lifetime). so I told my little girl that it was grandma just checking on us and she gave me a hug and smiled. Then approxitmaly ten minutes later we saw a large bright orange dot moving north well behind were the first dot was spotted. I ran inside and got my wife, son, and brother inlaw and we all walked out back to watch it. It moved about ten inches northward and made an abrupt turn to the west, went about two inches and turned again going south, then east, then south again. It proceeded to go, in a straight line, south untill it was out of sight dimming towards the end probably due to the earths atmosphere refracting the light."],"Region":"Maryland","Case Number":"50656","Log Number":"US-09072013-0022","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"white light moving north first only lasted a few seconds, second orange burning light moved in multiple directions, lasted 3-5 mins","City":"Cumberland","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Longitude":"-78.741801","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"09/07/2013 01:25 UTC","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/06/2013 09:55 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:07:00","Latitude":"39.683166","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
