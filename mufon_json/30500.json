Both my son and myself observed a shadow cast upon broken clouds. This shadow appeared to be about 25'-50' in width from the ground. Stretching horizon to horizon,from NNE-SSW. When I first saw it was not moving , but after pointing out the phenomena to my son it started moving rapidly in south by south-easterly direction. There were also contrails in the area all of which seemed to be stationary. The clouds were moving mostly in an easterly direction, with a ceiling above thirty-five thousand feet. While watching the shadow there was a brake in the clouds where the moon was visible, but there was no sign of what was causing the shadow.The next day I called N.O.A.A. to find out if any one else had seen it, or weather or not they knew what was. They told me that it was a contrail. Being that I spent 10yrs. in the Air Force, along being an avid sky watcher I knew better. Contrails don't move any thing like that this thing did."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-08102011-0030","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Latitude":"48.59702","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.59702,+-97.667306(30500)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30500) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/10/2011 05:43 UTC","Region":"North Dakota","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30500.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30500.html"]}
