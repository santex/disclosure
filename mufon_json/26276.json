I happened to just look up into the sky noticing how clear and blue it was. Suddenly I saw a white sphere coming from the Southwest. I thought it looked funny because there were no ���wings or tail��� that an airplane would have. It was small���I can only describe it as the same size as a large star you would see at night. There was no sound or contrails coming from it. The first white object was zipping very fast, just like a ���shooting star���, but it was flying straight, even with the horizon, not shooting down in an arc motion as a star would. Then, another white sphere came speeding from the same Southwest direction right along side the first one. The second one neared the first one, it was getting closer and closer to it���I wanted to see if they would ���join or connect��� with each other, but they disappeared behind some puffy clouds off into the Northeastern distance. By this time, I was at a stop light and the light turned green, so I had to drive ahead. These objects moved so quickly, I didn't have my camera with me, but I don't think I'd even have time to grab a camera and try to videotape them."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"10/15/2010 02:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/01/2010 01:20 UTC","Log Number":"US-11012010-0010","Latitude":"33.745314","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Rancho Mirage","There were no other sightings in Rancho Mirage on or around October 15th 2010"],"City":"Rancho Mirage","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-116.40927","Case Number":"26276","Summary":"2 white spheres speed across the sky","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California"}
