Looking to the northeast, through the nearly bare trees I saw two bright lights on top of an object. It appeared to be cigar shaped. Moving very fast to the North west.As it was still dark the object was not very vivid, though the lights were bright.It appeared to be closer than a mile away. Absolutely no sound.Lasting only a few seconds. It apperaed to be very large. Hard to tell size with no reference points. I checked time after siting and it was 7:01 to 7:03. Lost sight of it as it flew away as it was very fast. When I first saw it I thought I was seeing something unreal because there was no sound. I told my wife I think I saw a UFO. I was still processing what I had seen."],"Date Submitted":"10/29/2009 08:46 UTC"}
