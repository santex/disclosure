It was dark. I happened to look up in the sky and I saw an extra bright light and as I looked at it, it would move slowly to the right and left of me and would come closer and then move back. I went back inside and got my wife and daughter to come see if they were seeing what I was. They saw the same thing. I got my binoculars out and looked at it and could see it better. Still have no idea what it was. It has not been back in the sky since then each time I checked. The object had a bright light with 5 small lights below it. It appeared to be all one object. The small lights moved with the large object. The object moved only a few degrees across the sky. The object was viewed in the NE sky at dark from Stephenville at about 45 degrees above the horizen."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Texas","Longitude":"-98.192513","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/09/2008 07:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9736.html"],"trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were 8 other sightings in Stephenville on or around January 9th 2008"],"Latitude":"32.227896","Disposition":"Unknown"}
