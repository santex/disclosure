The sky was cloudy so you couldn't see any stars. About a mile from where Mill creek starts at Lebanon Rd, we looked up toward the southeast and saw a round star like object that glowed green. We saw it for about two seconds as it fell through the clouds. It was going way faster than any plane or helicopter I've ever seen. It flew downward at a 40 degree angle running parallel to us in the car. We only saw it for a few seconds because there were tall trees to the left of us. I would say that it was about 8 or 9 miles away from us, and a few thousand feet above us. Our part of Orange County is pretty populated, so I'm sure someone else had to have seen it. There's no way you could have missed a large green light flying through the clouds at night. I have no idea what it was, but I know I���ve never seen anything like it before."],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8823.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8823.html"],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Efland","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.081188,+-79.169032(8823)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8823) map </A>","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/07/2008 08:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-01112008-0004","City":"Efland"}
