What made it weird was that it kept flashinga very bright light, similar to a lighthouse motion, very quick and randmoly. Aswe approached the craft, it would begin to move one way as it were goingsomehwere, and all of a sudden it would stop and emit another beam of light.There was one or two lights on the craft, and we became certain that it wasneither a helicopter or a small plane due to its movements and lightpositioning. The guys in the car behind us luckily got it on tape, its visiblefor about 15 seconds and then it suddenly speeds off in the blink of an eye. Thecraft was quite close to the ground, compared to any airplane. It was strange."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1518.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1518.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/05/2002 06:00 UTC","Log Number":"","Date of the Event":"02/05/2002 06:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","City":"Amherst","Longitude":"-72.516667","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Region":"Massachusetts","Latitude":"42.366667","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.366667,+-72.516667(1518)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1518) map </A>","Summary":"Appeared to be a small plane from far until we got","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Amherst","There were no other sightings in Amherst on or around February 5th 2002"]}
