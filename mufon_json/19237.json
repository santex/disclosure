It was odd so I got up and said to my husband, \"what is that?\". We both went to the front porch and watched for a minute when I told him to get the camera. It was directly in front of us about 1,000 feet up (husband's estimate). He snapped a couple of pics and I watched it until it was out of my sight. It was a very still night, no wind. There was no sound coming from the object. It moved from north to south at a steady clip, never changing altitude. It didn't scare us, it was intriguing."],"Summary":"No sound, moving in a straight line.","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Corvallis","There were no other sightings in Corvallis on or around September 10th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
