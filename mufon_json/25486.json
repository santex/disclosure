To the left of the moon (which would be to the East)there was a bright \"star\". It wasn't blinking but emitting a steady bright light like most stars do. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me because the star seemed to be moving very slowly in a Southern direction. As I watched it I realized it was moving but too slowly for a satellite. I stepped to the door and asked my wife to come out to see it. She saw it and also said it was moving very slowly. A band of clouds were coming from the South at which time the star disappeared behind them. We watched for about 10 minutes as the clouds moved away but the \"star\" had disappeared."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"09/17/2010 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.7648,+-95.366453(25486)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25486) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"25486","Object Shape":"Star-like","Latitude":"40.7648","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Shenandoah","Log Number":"US-09172010-0013","Country":"United States"}
