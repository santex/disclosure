As I approached the Academy St exit ramp,I saw what at first appeared to be a string of red and green lights blinking slowly. As my car neared the lights, I found myself directly under an immense,low-flying craft. It was a huge, boomerang-shaped craft--it had a dark grey body and red and green lights along its \"wings\". It moved so slowly, it appeared to be floating. It was completely soundless. I tried to keep the object in sight,which was no easy feat since I had to keep my attention on the road. By the time I was able to park my car, the boomerang had vanished. When I first noticed this craft, I assumed it was some type of jet. The longer I watched it,however, the more I realized how impossible it would be for a jet to move that slowly, especially at such a low altitude. I also can't undersatand why nobody else has come forward about this. At the time of this sighting, there were at least a dozen other vehicles besides mine in the area."],"Summary":"Object moving south down rte 9--flying/floating slowly; immense, silent flying low.","City":"Poughkeepsie","Date of the Event":"05/12/2004 09:40 UTC","Region":"New York","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Poughkeepsie","There was one other sighting in Poughkeepsie on or around May 12th 2004"],"Date Submitted":"01/07/2010 08:47 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21394.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21394.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.701401,+-73.91642(21394)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21394) map </A>","Latitude":"41.701401","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Log Number":"US-01072010-0016"}
