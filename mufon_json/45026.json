{"Date Submitted":"01/04/2013 10:57 UTC","Case Number":"45026","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving home saw 1 orange light traveling from the SE. Pulled into the drive and watched as the light traveled to the east and started to fade. Then looked to the South and saw 3 more traveling in the same direction as the 1st in a triangular formation. They pretty much traveled the same path and started to fade. Saw a 5th light from the same location as previous 4, traveled the same path then faded away. All lights were traveling the same path, speed and altitude about the speed of a helicopter. They were blinking pretty fast similar to anti-collision but were constant. Don't believe I've ever seem anything like that."],"City":"Overland Park","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/04/2013 09:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01042013-0023","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45026.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45026.html"],"Latitude":"38.985778","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Overland Park","There were no other sightings in Overland Park on or around January 4th 2013"],"Longitude":"-94.666822","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"witnessed 1 orange light then 3 in triangle formation then 1 trailing.","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Kansas","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.985778,+-94.666822(45026)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45026) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30"}
