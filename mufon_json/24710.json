I kept driving as these dots got bigger, there was about five of them. As i went up the hill (as i live on a very steep hill), these dots turned into circles to the left of me. I couldnt take my eyes of them. They seemed to be moving not too fast but quite quickly. I stoped the car in confusion, locked my doors and looked up. Then it went from five circles to two. I did think i was just been silly and was thinking of all these other things it could have been, but it couldnt have been anything else. I like to think there is something out there, hopefully nice and kind haha. There are billions of things we don't know about this world. I would love to know, but for some reason its all a secret to us!!! I stayed there for about a min then drove of fast as i got scared on my own. Got home and the whole family were laughing at me, i dont care because i know what i saw that night. It could have been something or nothing. :)"],"Longitude":"-2.241196"}
