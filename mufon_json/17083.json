We got the binoculars because it appeared to be on fire. Upon further inspection it looked like a disk or oval shaped object with an orange fireball around its' mid-section. It wasn't the typical flame that trails an object losing altitude, rather this object gained altitude fairly quickly and the fireball seemed to surround the object in a HUGE spike-like fashion. My wife believes she saw a pulsating white light, however I did not witness this. There was absolutely no noise involved. The object over the course of the next minute or so continued to gain altitude until we lost sight of it behind the clouds. We wondered if this could possibly be some type of missle but quickly dismissed that idea. All we know is this was not any type of aircraft we're familiar with. We're still completely in awe of the whole event."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Killingly","There were no other sightings in Killingly on or around May 23rd 2009"],"Date of the Event":"05/23/2009 08:15 UTC","Summary":"Saw what appeared to be an aircraft on fire.","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/23/2009 08:15 UTC","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Connecticut","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.831389,+-71.850278(17083)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17083) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-71.850278","Case Number":"17083","City":"Killingly","Log Number":"US-05232009-0008"}
