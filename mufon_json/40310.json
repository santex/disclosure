We heard someone we know beep as they drove by the front and glanced over our shoulder and noticed what looked like a glowing red-orange balloon in the sky that was moving steadily to the northeast and getting smaller (maybe from moving away) until it disappeared. This lasted for several minutes. We thought maybe it was a firework but had never seen one float along like that for so long. We tried taking a picture, but it turned out blurry (it was still on fireworks setting) so we took a short video of it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.988126,+-81.176496(40310)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40310) map </A>","City":"Barnesville","Case Number":"40310","Latitude":"39.988126","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40310.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40310.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
