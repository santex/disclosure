I first thought it might be an odd shaped balloon, because it was smooth and shiny. Gray in color. and it wasn't making any noise. As it passed over our house I thought \"No it's not a balloon, there is no wind and this thing is going aprox 40 mph.\" There was no engine pods. no lights. no windows. no control surfaces. no trailing edge. ( All wings that I know about aren't rounded at the rear edge Like this craft was.) I've been to oshkosh a few times so I've seen a lot of planes, and I build and fly RC planes."],"City":"Sugar Grove","Date Submitted":"07/06/2010 11:12 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24296.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24296.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"41.768458","Region":"Illinois","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
