Central Illinois. 12:45 AM. Altitude less than 300 feet, more than 100 feet First heard it as it approached from the west about a quarter of a mile away, last heard it as it passed over our house heading due east. I woke up and was laying in bed, within a 25 seconds of waking I head a thrumming sound coming from the west passing over the house heading east. It made a deep deep (marble bouncing on a table) sound. An even sound with an even space, each cycle was a second in duration. Buuud-ud-ud-ud-udum............Buuud-ud-ud-ud-udum............Buuud-ud-ud-ud-udum............Buuud-ud-ud-ud-udum............ Four thrums to cover a quarter mile of sky. Quarter mile in four seconds. It also didn't have the Doppler effect, thus the thrums were an even cadence and tone and volume. As it passed over the house I felt the vibration of the last thrum."],"Case Number":"34756","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Illinois","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-01102012-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.6658,+-89.04222(34756)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34756) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Hudson","There were no other sightings in Hudson on or around January 10th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/10/2012 02:33 UTC","Longitude":"-89.04222","Date of the Event":"01/10/2012 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
