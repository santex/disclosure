When I got home my daughter kept telling me the had seen a second sun. She told me how she had been riding in the back seat of the car in her booster seat and observed this great light she called a second sun. The sun should have been on the west of the car. My daughter was telling my mom to look at the second sun. My mom initially told her the sun was over on the other side of the car. But because my 5 year old was so persistent, my mom finally looked. My mom and daughter both described a brilliant light as big and as bright as the sun that was changing colors and hovering. Their account was so dramatic regarding this light that was as big as the sun that I called the media and asked if there were any reports of this light. There were none. I do not know the actual date. I only know that it was early fall in the year or two prior to our moving to Missouri. We moved here in 2004."],"Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10282010-0005","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Alabama","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","trends":[],"Longitude":"-86.895258","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.326961,+-86.895258(26155)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26155) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/28/2010 11:35 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Other"}
