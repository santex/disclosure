I was on the back porch of the house property star-gazing. I saw what I thought was a star suddenly moving in the very distant night sky. Then it seemed to stop and then it moved again. I decided to get my camera and tripod and document the event. I guess I thought maybe it could be a satellite, but I didn't know. I never lost sight of the object and probably have over ten minutes of footage of whatever it is. In the footage there is a glow around the object as a result of the focus; and there are trees in the foreground to more clearly demonstrate the object's movement. Note: I did not see a glow around the object before the achieved focus."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11035.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11035.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"41.142519","City":"Pleasantville","Longitude":"-73.777809","Summary":"I captured a UFO on miniDV tape with a tripod.
