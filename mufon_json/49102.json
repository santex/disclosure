Thru the sunroof we saw something hovering above just over the tree line. It had a formation of the big dipper...4 lights in sort of a square and then 3 in a sort of handle like the big dipper. behind this were 6 or 7 lights in a straight line. the lights were orange. Not fire, not glowing...just orange lights in a perfectly square form. It hovered as we kept driving and as we moved on we could see it going south in a straight light. I have never seen anything like this. I do not believe in aliens etc..but i know what I saw. It was real whatever it was. There was no sound that we could hear. There was no other cars for miles on the road. It was dark, no street lights. On google image...I have seen photos that look almost exactly like what I saw."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Norton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"something large with approx 14 orange lights in square pattern hovered over our car as we drove North on Rt. 21 towards Cleveland","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"41.029222","Region":"Ohio","Date Submitted":"07/21/2013 08:55 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/20/2013 09:40 UTC","Country":"United States"}
