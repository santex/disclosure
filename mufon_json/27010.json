Saw 3 orange orbs in tight (but more flat than narrow) V formation with orange wakes the width of each orb and one orange orb trailing about twice the distance of the space between the orbs in the V, the trailer orb aligned with the center orb. I commented to my husband who, of course, couldn't see them from his angle! I watched them move westward. They passed in the vicinity of an airplane and the plane looked as though it was standing still in comparison. It was quite exciting. I listened to the news and checked the papers the next day and did not hear a word about it."],"Case Number":"27010","Date Submitted":"12/16/2010 03:47 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12162010-0006","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"3 orange orbs in a V formation trailed by one orange orb","Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Circle","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27010.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27010.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/10/2010 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
