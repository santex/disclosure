I looked up and they were gone. A coupple minutes later there they were again but this time in a ladder shape paralle to each other but now there were 9 red lights instead of 8. they were moving and as they were moving they were forming into really weird shapes that almost looked like a z or almost a k. then they were flashing for a second than stoped. I could not see they for a couple seconds but when i did there were only 8 again.. theyh started droping down but like floated down until there was one left in the sky but than i could not see it anymore and it disappered. At first i thought it was a ufo but other people thought it was a landing thing for air plains. It was very very weird."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15559.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15559.html"],"Region":"New Jersey","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States"}
