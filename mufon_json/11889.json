We spotted a very bright light, a starburst shape, that was high in the sky and moving in a SE direction. It was very bright at first. It was moving slowly in an erratic type motion, almost wobbling as it headed SE. We commented that is was definitely not an airplane or a meteor. It started to fade, then was just a spot of light. It turned red and then disappeared. At the same time we saw a meteor shoot across the sky, so it was markedly different than the meteor. The whole event lasted about 30 seconds. We knew we had seen something remarkable and different than we had ever seen."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.662048,+-122.964018(11889)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11889) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/02/2008 10:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11889.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11889.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
