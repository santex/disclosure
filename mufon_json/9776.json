{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking home from the library when I looked up, and saw an apparent severe meteor shower, as the sky was all streaked. I occasionally would look up at it when one time I did I saw a sphere high in the sky come down to the ground. It was about the size of a basketball, as it suddenly stopped and hovered a foot from the ground in a field across the street from me. It hovered for about 3 seconds then in one sweeping fast motion flew straight up, and out into space at a high speed. I do not know if there was any connection with the meteor shower and the sphere. Thank you."],"Latitude":"33.775505","Summary":"A sighted sphere during an apparent meteor shower.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9776.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9776.html"],"Longitude":"-117.937648","Date of the Event":"11/30/1989 04:40 UTC","City":"Garden Grove","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.775505,+-117.937648(9776)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9776) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Garden Grove","There were no other sightings in Garden Grove on or around November 30th 1989"],"Case Number":"9776","Log Number":"US-02282008-0036","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/30/1989 04:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON"}
