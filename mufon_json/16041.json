Lots of birds singing. No other noises. I was taking photos of a historical mansion and I found an object in the sky of one photo once I got home. I never saw this while I was there, nor did i hear it. I take careful notes of the ambient sounds out there as I usually record for EVPS (often I am successful). there were no planes, helis or anything else there,that I heard. It doesn't look like a bird to me. it appears to be too large and pretty high up in relation to the tree and the house. I would like professional input please"],"Case Number":"16041","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.927264,+-86.86028(16041)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16041) map </A>","Latitude":"35.927264","Date Submitted":"03/09/2009 01:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Teardrop","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Franklin","There were no other sightings in Franklin on or around March 9th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Franklin","Log Number":"US-03152009-0020","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
