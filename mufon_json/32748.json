The meteor was so close and bright that bits of debris and flames were visible. Thinking nothing of it we continued our conversation when approximately 1 minute after the meteor I looked up and saw a triangle of lights directly over us flying silently in the exact same path, from NE to SW, as the meteor. The object was moving quickly but from the moment we saw it till it finally disappeared into the horizon took about 15-20 seconds. The meteor may be a coincidence, but I figured I might as well include it."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"32748","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Features":"Unknown"}
