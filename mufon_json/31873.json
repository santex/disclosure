{"divs":["Sighting DetailsGot out of a restaurant with my girlfrend and her family. We saw about 20 plus ufo's ascending from the east to west and would Disintegrate. They blinked out almost right above our heads. They had different fleet line ups some that were closer to each other would group up in triangulate positions, and disintegrate quicker than the ones that weren't by one another. they were glowing orange with small red lights on top. I notice that a airplane changed its path to get a better look. I did get video of it but however i left my cam at my parents place i will update with it tomorrow."],"Region":"Illinois","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Plainfield","There were no other sightings in Plainfield on or around September 17th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Case Number":"31873","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"41.623035","Log Number":"US-09182011-0003","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Plainfield","Longitude":"-88.196369","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31873.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Got out of a restaurant with my girlfrend and her family.
