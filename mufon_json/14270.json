{"Summary":"Large triangle with yellowish light at the tip, and 3-4 lights along the sides.","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date of the Event":"06/15/2006 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsit was summer 2006. my two sons (2 and 4 at the time) and i had just returned from shopping at wal mart. it was around 8:30-9:00pm, and it was warm because i remember we all wore shorts. that's why i figure it was june\\july. anyways, we live on an indian reservation in central cali,and there are not many lights (streetlights, etc). it's in the foothills of the sierra nevada range, so we have a nice big clear shot of the night sky. anyways, we pulled up next to the house and i got out to open the van door for my boys. soon as i opened the door and my 4 year old jumped out, i happened to catch movement in the corner of my eye. i looked up and i saw a huge triangle of lights moving silently from east to west over the oak tree behind our house. i'm not good at estimating size or distance, but i would say it was roughly the size of a large airplane, and it was flying about as low as the water helicopters do when they are fighting fires. it was low. there was a light at the tip, and i'm thinking 3 lights down each side. i seem to recall four lights making up each side of the triangle. the bottom had no lights. i couldn't make out any craft, other than the lights. i told me son, \"hey look at that\" and he says to me \"it's a spaceship\". lol the weird thing is, it moved without a sound. but, just about the time it got to the hills to the west (couple miles away?) all of a sudden you could hear the roaring sound of like a bunch of fighter jets, coming from over the mountain range, which is 12-14 miles from the house. i don't know if it was the \"ufo's\" engines or if there actually were jets following it. i went inside the house and put the local news on, and nothing. nothing on the radio either. i thought about calling in and asking if anyone else had seen it, but i just let it go. funny that no one else around the rez has mentioned it since. how could i have been the only one to see it?? well, me and my boys. i have a theory. i think it could be us military aircraft. i mean, the \"flight path\" would have been in line with china lake nafb and lemoore nafb. and, it's federal land."],"Latitude":"36.0702","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12072008-0002","Country":"United States","Region":"California","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.0702,+-119.015108(14270)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14270) map </A>","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14270.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14270.html"],"City":"Porterville","Date Submitted":"06/15/2006 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"14270","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Porterville","There were no other sightings in Porterville on or around June 15th 2006"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-119.015108"}
