I also ruled out a plane as well due to it looked like it was on fire the light continued to flicker. a few seconds after that there was another one at a distance ( if i were to guesstimate the distance between one and the other i would say half of mile) also the same thing same description as the first.... i took photographs but very blurry due to not the highest resolution and the distance between us and the ufo were farther then my camera can zoom to. My friends and family all viewed this and in amazed of this.... this lasted a little over 5 minutes.. i advised this a friend who is also believer of UFO...the direction from to... they came from 192 degrees south tours 327 degrees NW. my feelings were excitement, wow i cant really explain it. lost sight when they both disappear"],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Kendall","There were no other sightings in Kendall on or around January 1st 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Oval","Case Number":"44922","Country":"United States","Summary":"was very at least a little slower then a plane. it was 2 of the same figuer flame like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.671234,+-80.352067(44922)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44922) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44922.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44922.html"],"Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"25.671234","Log Number":"US-01012013-0047"}
