Object rose for about 6-8 seconds, stopped for a another few seconds and bottom of object started to glow orange-red and then moved at a 45 degree angle from it's rise going towards the west. Object continued moving west for another 7-10 seconds and stopped completely again. At this point, the object started to change from the blue color to a solid glowing red in about 4 seconds and then object shot up straight into the night sky at what seemed like light speed. Object never made a sound and if we would have had cameras then, the object was so clear, that I am sure the pictures would have provided a very clear image of what we saw. On the following night, another group of friends that we had told about our sighting, drove out to the area in question and were supposedly chased by two white lights which they said turned out to be two, military like choppers. They said they were frightened by the chase until the choppers turned back after a few miles of being chased down Black River Village Road and Old Cavern Hwy."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.2287,+-104.068858(37641)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37641) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","City":"Malaga","Country":"United States","Region":"New Mexico","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Malaga","There was one other sighting in Malaga on or around September 3rd 1993"],"Log Number":"US-04212012-0018","Latitude":"32.2287","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37641.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37641.html"]}
