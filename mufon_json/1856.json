I usually stand out and watch for falling stars. Directly overhead Isaw a moving light. As my eyes foucussed I could see that the light closelyresembled the right edge of a capital D (letter). The light was faintly whiteand blurred like neon. The object appeared to be at a great distance and wasabout the size of my index finger. The object moved rapidly from directlyoverhead to the western horizon. Perhaps a second of time lapsed or at best asecond and a half. The sky was very dark so visibilty was very good. There wasno audible sound related to the object in fact it seemed unusually quiet to me. Perhaps the silence was due to my own curious feeling mixed with a little awe."],"Case Number":"1856","Date Submitted":"09/06/2002 04:48 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
