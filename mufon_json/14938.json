It seemed out of place. I called a friend outside to help verify what I was seeing. We agreed it was out of the ordinary and wathced as long as the very frigid evening would allow. The sky was clear,exceptionally cold, and near zero temperature. He returned indoors and I continued to my truck, got what I needed and headed back indoors. As I walked away from my vehicle I glanced over my shoulder to get one last look at the object and it was gone. I called my friend back outside to show him that the object had disappeared. Neither one of us had a rational explaination. Just wondering if anyone else saw something similar about that time?"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.601181","Summary":"Bright flashing red orange star like anomaly low North West horizon.","Log Number":"US-01152009-0013","Case Number":"14938","Date Submitted":"01/15/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14938.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14938.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Cortland","There were no other sightings in Cortland on or around January 15th 2009"]}
