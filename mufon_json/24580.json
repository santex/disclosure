{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were relaxing on the porch,in chairs on either side of our front door, facing north. I noticed what I thought were lightning bugs in the near sky. I was amazed at how fast they were blinking as they seemed to disappear behind a large tree, or disappear as these insects do. The upper light was above,away, and ahead of the lower. Both blinking as if talking... almost synchronized but very fast. I then noticed them blinking in breaks in the tree, and still the same estimated distance apart. I told my wife to watch as they started to clear the other side of the tree (they were moving from west to east). I asked her to explain to me what she was seeing, and her story was exactly what I was seeing. I watched as they seemed to turn north as they approached the next tree that would block my line of sight. They either slowed and disappeared, or turned north and sped off."],"Date Submitted":"07/17/2010 02:22 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-83.547412","City":"Toledo","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.668718,+-83.547412(24580)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24580) map </A>","Summary":"Two UFO's, one above, away, and ahead of the lower.
