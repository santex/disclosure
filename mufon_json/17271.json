Its flew from the west to the east. it must be a very high altitude I mention it looks very big, compare to a airplane from my distance a couple of mm to the distance of 10 cm. On front of the two shadows was a flashing light very slow flying it make a halve circle. At an higher altitude i saw like a star flying, what i saw often in the past time. I was very excited and scared in the same time, because they must be really Big. I really dont know what's going on there ....?"],"Country":"United Kingdom","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Brinsworth","There were no other sightings in Brinsworth on or around May 31st 2009"],"Region":"England"}
