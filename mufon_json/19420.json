The light was brighter on the outer edges and darker in the center, almost like an upside down V. about 10 minutes later, I noticed what looked like a star moving across the sky from south to north. my wife thought it might be a plane. it was very high and was not blinking and the light stayed consistant the whole time. About 20 minutes after that I saw the same light traveling the same direction. the brightness or the shape of the light did not change as it went across the sky. We never heard a sound from any of these objects."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.0546,+-74.912497(19420)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19420) map </A>","Case Number":"19420"}
