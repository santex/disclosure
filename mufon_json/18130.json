(no alcohol\\drugs involved). i noticed something i couldn't i.d.. about 200-300 ft. above a cluster of trees i saw a reddish glowing light moving in my direction. i then hollered for my grandma to come look. we both watched as it made a gradual turn from eastbound to the south. as i was fixating on the object my grandma said \"look, there's another one\" it followed the exact course of the other(about a 1\\2 mile behind the other). i should point out that we heard no sound nor could we see any sort of attached apparatus(i.e. hot air ballon or parachute etc.) they seemed circular in shape and although i had nothing to use to scale the size, it seemed to be about the size of a tire you would find on a bulldozer. at this point my feelings were an equal mix of intrigue and fear. the approx. speed was 14- 22 mph. once they were heading south towards seattle, they made a slight increase in altitude. they never vanished. we watched until they passed trees on a hill gradually fading out of sight. we didn't call 911 because honestly how does it sound to say \"it's july 4th and i'm seeing lights in the sky! (in 2001 i had my first unexplainable event while in central mexico so i'm not a skeptic.) the event lasted about 12-18 min. from first sighting to the point where it was out of our field of vision. unless a few rich men constructed two devices to create a hoax, i can say with absolution that my grandma and i saw two ufo's who thought they'd get a closer look at what us crazy earthlings were doing sending colorful explosives into the sky. and perhaps they thought \"no better time to check out the place since the sky is full of lights of all colors and shapes\""],"Latitude":"47.718978","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Spokane","There were no other sightings in Spokane on or around July 4th 2009"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:17:00","Summary":"aside from obvious fireworks, we saw 2 reddish lights(no sound) moving at a steady pace. trailing apart from each other.","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 11:10 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Washington","City":"Spokane","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.718978,+-117.427903(18130)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18130) map </A>","Case Number":"18130","Longitude":"-117.427903","Log Number":"US-07172009-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18130.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18130.html"]}
