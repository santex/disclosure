I was watching TV. I saw a large bright glowing reddish orange light traveling west and ran back inside to get binoculars when I got back outside it was further west and behind the palm trees. I got into the car with my son to go to the park to observe and take a video. It was gone! We went to nearby industrial park across the street to see if it was anywhere above the Everglades. All we saw was about 7 helicopters in the area by 595 & 75. Please note the industrial park borders the Everglades at the end of Sunrise Blvd. It looked like a giant transparent hot air balloon that was on fire. It was about 75 feet above the lake. It was moving at about 10 mph. almost like it was drifting by and gaining altitude. We were completely freaked out and wanted to know what it was! We never experienced anything like this before."],"Region":"Florida","Longitude":"-80.312658","City":"Sunrise","Case Number":"44253","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"11/30/2012 10:27 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.15655,+-80.312658(44253)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44253) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cone, Fireball, Oval","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"26.15655","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44253.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44253.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Large bright glowing object passed over lake","Log Number":"US-11302012-0007"}
