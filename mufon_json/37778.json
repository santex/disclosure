I noticed a shining rectangle rotating horizontally and slowly. It apeared to be flat, one side was reflective and the other dark. At first we thought something was blowing in the wind, but it was very high up and stationary, not moving randomly. We tryed to make sense of it, did something fall from a plane? no fluttering movements the way something would have if it was falling. A kite? no strings and over a construction site with nothing around. Our minds refused it, but it kept bothering us, so we turned around and by the time we got back to the spot it was gone."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"43.348753"}
