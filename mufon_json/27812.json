I saw what I though to be a shooting star, yellowish in color. It seemed faster than a normal shooting star. As it streaked down at an angle...suddenly as it hit an approximate altitude...instead of the normal burnout disappearance, the speed slowed to half and it suddenly moved horizonally until I could no longer see it due to structures in my view. NO WAY that was a shooting star. NO WAY it was any known aircraft! The speed and change in direction were extremely apparent. I was excited and my heart was racing the instant it's speed and direction were noted. I ran inside to tell others what I had just seen."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 126 other sightings in Indianapolis","There were no other sightings in Indianapolis on or around February 13th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"27812","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27812.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27812.html"],"Weather Factors":"Windy","Region":"Indiana","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/14/2011 11:46 UTC","Log Number":"US-02142011-0008","Latitude":"39.774736","Summary":"Not a shooting star!","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/13/2011 10:25 UTC","City":"Indianapolis"}
