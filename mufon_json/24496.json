The last person to go to bed is supposed to lower them. As i was the last one up on the night in question, I proceeded to lower the blinds. I first noticed the object because I saw lights like that of a jumbo jet (note- Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is only a few miles away). So my first impression was it was a plane ready to land. However, I notice there was something odd when I didn't hear any noise. In addition, it was moving too slow to be a plane. The object moved slowly for approx. 3 minutes and 35 seconds, before abruptly accelerating. I followed the object until it was outside my plane of vision. During the sighting, at first I was annoyed because I thought the noise might wake people up from sleep. After I realized there was no sound, I was bewildered until I fell asleep."],"Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24496.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24496_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24496.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
