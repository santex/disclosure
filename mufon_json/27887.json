He looked over to his right, south west direction and noticed it hovering there. He told me to look, so I did. It looked like a ball of orange light hovering about 500 feet away in the top of the tree line above the mountain. At first thought, it looked like the top of the trees were on fire but it wasnt. We watched it hover there for about 3 minutes. It flashed once and then my husband said it looked it went into \"warpspeed\". He said it disappeared quick into a small dot. I was extremely excited because this is my first UFO experience! We KNOW it wasnt an air craft of any kind."],"Longitude":"-83.430394","Latitude":"38.18825","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02182011-0009","Case Number":"27887","City":"Morehead"}
