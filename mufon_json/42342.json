I was standing on my back porch getting ready to lock the doors. I looked up at the midnight sky and observed this object for about 1 minute just \"floating through the air\". There was no doubt that this was no ordinary aircraft. It had no blinking lights, warning lights or sound.It continued on a NNW direction until I also witnessed 3 aircraft come from a SSE direction following or trying to catch up to this light.
