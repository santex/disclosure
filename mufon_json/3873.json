I notice a triangler shaped Object with three circular lights, one light on each point of the triangle. This object was floating in the direction toward toronto CN Tower from mississauga's lake shore area. At first I thought this object might be a blimp then I thought a triangler shaped blimp? never seen one of those before. At this time of night? hmmm As I was walking home I notice this oriental lady walking by. I remember thinking to myself should I stop this lady and ask her if she sees the samething. I'm not sure if I ask or not. But I remember coming home seeing my brother outside having a smoke as the object floated away over lake ontario."],"City":"Mississauga","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3873.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3873.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/31/1995 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"3873","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-79.63491","Date of the Event":"05/31/1995 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-09212005-0005","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.598865,+-79.63491(3873)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3873) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City"}
