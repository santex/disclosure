After cleaning, I figured some nice pictures of it would be nice. I parked it in a nice spot in the yard and began taking some pictures. I went for a short ride and then came home a couple hours later and put the pics on my computer and that's when I noticed an odd object in one of the pics. At first, I said to my girlfriend \"What the hell is that?\". She took a look and I zoomed in on the picture and realized what it was, and we just stared at it for a while. I then recalled that shortly after the picture was taken that my cellphone battery had just died. I never saw or heard anything while I was taking pictures, just happened to spot it after uploading the pics."],"Region":"Virginia","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.435903,+-78.649394(48300)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48300) map </A>","Object Shape":"Disc","Log Number":"US-06212013-0010","Latitude":"37.435903","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"48300","Longitude":"-78.649394","Date Submitted":"06/21/2013 09:17 UTC","Summary":"taking pictures in my yard and discovered apparent UFO in one image"}
