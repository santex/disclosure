{"Source":"MUFON","City":"Denver","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"08/27/2011 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy fiancee and I were at the Broncos VS. Seahawks game at Mile High Stadium. We went to the balcony area on the 5th level and looked out over denver. A bright light dropped from the sky and hoovered over the city. There was no pulsation of light or color, nor sound. The object went from a stand still to an immidiate crossing over the entire down town area. The object dropped 90 degrees downward and then zig zaged its way up to cloud level. The bright object disappeared behind the rest of the stadium. My fiancee caught the object coming back through the clouds in the opposite direction faster then anything she had witnissed before. The object jet off and disappeared in a matter of less then a second into the sky above."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31598.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31598.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"09/06/2011 08:52 UTC","Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"39.745671","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:10","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Case Number":"31598","Longitude":"-105.018928","Summary":"bright light traveling incredibly fast and changing direction several times","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other","Log Number":"US-09062011-0025","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around August 27th 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.745671,+-105.018928(31598)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31598) map </A>"}
