It look sold dimond, or triangle shape 10 - 15 miles twards the south of me. I pulled my car over, by that time it covered the total horizon, at it's hight it had to coverhundreds of miles in a few seconds. Two minites later I saw one plane going north-east at 3,000 to 5,000 feet. it was out of sight before I could get my cell phone out for a pic. The wholr thing was less than 15 seconds. No plane can cover that amount of space. I lost it by distance not the horizon. I was on my way home after shopping and looking at the moon and planets when I noticed this movingaway from my direction. I never saw anything like this before. When I got home at 6:12PM I had two cell phones with me and one said I had 2 calls, but my phone didn't ring."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.290493,+-88.018409(45183)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45183) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Mundelein","There was one other sighting in Mundelein on or around January 13th 2013"],"City":"Mundelein","Object Shape":"Diamond, Triangle","Date Submitted":"01/13/2013 08:32 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Log Number":"US-01132013-0012","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
