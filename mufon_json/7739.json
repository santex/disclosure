{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was sitting in my car i looked to the right and i seen what i thought was some sort of firework but i didnt hear anything it was shaped like a U but filled in at the top it was florescent green with a white light inside of it i am not sure if there was a tail but it almost looked like something was in front of it rather than behind it it was 60 ft in the air right above the tree line there was a plane flying behind it to the north this object i seen in the east this is definately something i have seen many meteors and shooting stars they are no where near as big as this but it seemed to move as fast as a shooting star the colors around it looked a greenish color like some of the shooting stars i have seen before but this object is huge compared to any meteors i have ever seen if the object was arms length it would be the sixe of a cereal box i cant tell how far it was but it looked as though it was 60 feet high right above the tree lines again i was sitting in my car i leaned over looked out the passenger door i just happened to look over when i seen this object the plane that was passing by could have caught it on radar i dont know i was freaked out by this i look at the night sky alot i know the differnce between any planes, meteors, satelites i know this was either a large meteor or a ufo being that it was florescent green and a U shape i can honestly say it probally wasnt a meteor definately not a plane im not sure because it happened so fast but it almost looked like a tail below the U shaped object"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-08232007-0009","Case Number":"7739","Date of the Event":"08/23/2007 10:35 UTC","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","Summary":"i seen a u shaped object, florescent green with a white light inside it vanished in a split second","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.89178,+-75.116286(7739)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7739) map </A>","Latitude":"39.89178","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7739.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7739.html"],"Longitude":"-75.116286","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"08/23/2007 10:35 UTC","City":"Gloucester City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Gloucester City","There were no other sightings in Gloucester City on or around August 23rd 2007"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"New Jersey","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01"}
