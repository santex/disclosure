Rate was not rapid (but too fast to be a flare, and no report from firework heard) - I saw it descend about 15 degrees at least in terms of the arc of the sky - almost straight down. No trail visible behind fireball - there was still a little light on the western horizon, maybe that obscured a trail. Ball had a \"halo\" around it - VERY light clouds visible in that direction. Was several times brighter than venus."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.210922,+-77.185495(6545)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6545) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/11/2007 08:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball"}
