{"Country":"United States","divs":["sighting detailsi was in my backyard facing northeast watching the sky for anything of interest. i had just watched two meteors and was hoping for more when my wife spotted a soft red\\yellow light headed south under high clouds. we first thought it was a helicopter because it was moving slowly and low in the sky. as we watched we noticed there were no flashing lights at all, just a fuzzy light changing from red to yellow to orange and back to red, but not in any set order. what stuck us was that it was below the cloud line ruling out a satelite. as we watched for four to five minutes we watched the light move out from under the high clouds and out into the open sky when it just disappeared. by that time i grabbed my binoculars and scanned the region of sky where it disappeared i couldn't see anything except for the stars in the background. additionally, the area it disappeared in was an area of the sky just near and approaching sky harbor international airport. never once was there any noticeable structure or blinking lights suggesting an airplane and it moved very slowly standing still from time to time. after it disappeared we both said, now there's one for the records. it was definitely unusual. we watch the sky often."],"trends":[],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-11182012-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43991.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43991.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/18/2012 12:27 UTC","Summary":"red-yellow fuzzy light, not blinking, below clouds moving in slow meandering pattern, sometime stationary, watched for about 5 minutes then it faded out once over Sky Harbor Airport","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Case Number":"43991","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Region":"Arizona","Date of the Event":"11/17/2012 08:30 UTC","Latitude":"34.056368","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.056368,+-111.085701(43991)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43991) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-111.085701","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
