I do not know why why he or she was doing this for, but it made a quite a few very weird strainge manouvers. like a acrobat. I thought it was going to crash right into Midway Airport, and that had really scared to death! Why would a Military Aircraft be doing aireobatic manouvers right in the middle of a public comercial airport? Does anyone knows the reason for this???...
