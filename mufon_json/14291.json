It was 8:35am. It was such a clear day the sky was crystal blue. As I passed a farm on Saxonburg Boulevard, I was looking directly into the sky as I was approaching a curve in the road, thinking about how beautiful the sky was and how I would not have too many days like this to ride my motorcycle. I saw a stationary, diamond shaped shiny object up in the sky. I was about to pull over to take a picture but when I came around the curve, I looked up at the sky and the object was gone. I looked in all directions, there was no object to be found anywhere. It made me feel quite small, but I felt like I had witnessed something spectacular. Every day I look up into the sky at that exact spot to see if I can see the object again. Unfortunately, my sighting was only about 7 seconds long, I wish that it had been longer and I had seen the shape move."],"Latitude":"40.448635","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Region":"Pennsylvania","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"11/07/2008 08:35 UTC","trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around November 7th 2008"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Diamond, Flash","City":"Pittsburgh","Date Submitted":"11/07/2008 08:35 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14291.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14291.html"]}
