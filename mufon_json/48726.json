{"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my family were outside on the 4th of july when we noticed a floating orange light in the sky. this was my 3rd time seeing them so could tell it was neither a fire work or a plan. we watched the first one and it went up at a diagonal angle slowly then pulsated then disappeared. Then we saw another one do the same exact thing. it also disappeared in the same place. then another one came. followed by two more. the last one was bright red. they were all pulsating. and one by one they disappeared. Since it was 4th of july everybody was outside. I think my neighbors saw it to cause they were all watching in that direction. it wasnt a fire work or a plane. It could have been a chinese lantern. but like i said i keep seeing these. The first time i reported it. but i didnt the second time. but now that i saw this i thought it needed to be reported. I know other people in my area saw it to so i hope my report will be followed by theirs."],"Longitude":"-86.570487","Case Number":"48726","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 08:25 UTC","Region":"Tennessee","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48726.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48726.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.521861","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","Log Number":"US-07062013-0014","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.521861,+-86.570487(48726)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48726) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/06/2013 01:50 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"(GS) We saw 5 lights moving in a straight path for around 5 minutes.
