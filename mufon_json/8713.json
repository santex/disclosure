Looking up in the sky, I spied what I thought was a star. It looked just like a star in the sky. I noticed that it was moving. I thought, \"Strange.\" I watched it as it came across the sky. Then, it came to a dead stop. I assume it then went straight up into space, because it grew dimmer and dimmer, til it was gone."],"trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Princeton","There were no other sightings in Princeton on or around December 26th 2007"],"City":"Princeton","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"\"Star\" glides across sky...","Date Submitted":"12/26/2007 05:49 UTC"}
