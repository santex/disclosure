There was no big sound, just a muffled pop. When it exploded concentric rings came from the center in a plane. They were all colors of the rainbow, and I could feel them pass through me because I was at the same elevation as the event. It felt like vibrations, or if wind could pass through you. Roughly 3000ft. I was looking out the window over a scene of the whole mountains south of the highway 17 over pass and Monterey Bay, and it was broad daylight. The news reported it as a meteor. I believe it was a ufo crash. There were no visible debris. And it came in realllly fast!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.235808,+-121.962375(24401)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24401) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07102010-0011","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Explosion over Santa Cruz Mountains.","Date Submitted":"07/10/2010 07:19 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Case Number":"24401","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-121.962375","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Los Gatos","There were no other sightings in Los Gatos on or around June 13th 2003"],"City":"Los Gatos","Country":"United States"}
