I was actually scanning the sky for passing satellites. Looking toward the eastern sky, at first I saw three orange triangles moving across from east to west. No sound or any movement variation between the three lights. As I watched them fly above, the triangular lights were brighter toward their centers. As the lights were overhead, you could see a structure holding them together. It appeared to be transparent like a cloak. Planes were also in the area passing that appeared the size of ticks compared to the size craft. As I moved to get a better view, everything disappeared."],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Date Submitted":"06/18/2012 11:00 UTC","Longitude":"-83.358286","City":"Clarkston","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/15/2012 11:20 UTC","Case Number":"39495","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06182012-0022","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.718517,+-83.358286(39495)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39495) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
