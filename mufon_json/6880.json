a picture would not even due the sunset any justice and neither would seeing a photo or video of the ���craft��� i had seen. as my brother hurried towards the backyard, his eyes were not adjusted to see what i was seeing. i felt alone in enjoying this, but none the less it was beautiful. as my brother was out in the backyard with me, only three were remaining heading towards the northeast sky, and eventually the city lights obscured it from total sight as they moved apart from each other, where the middle one stopped moving the way it did towards the left light craft. the lights were like that of a medium star that you would see in the night sky, but it did not pulsate or give off rays, (as if a kid were to draw the sun where rays are being placed around the sun) such as the stars exhibit at night. the light was oval shaped but not totally, it seemed like a solid light but not emitting light out wards (it's as if the energy of the light was contained in its structure), and it was definitely thousands of feet up in the sky. i know that we have bad depth perception when estimating the distance in the sky at night, but i have looked at objects fly over my house at night, so i have some confidence in my statement. also the estimation has to be drawn by how big the object was, so if i were to guess the size, just one of the lights that split up had to be bigger than a conventional airplane. there were no other planes or conventional objects in the area. it did not move in a straight line in the southwest to northeast direction, but swiftly and naturally. the main word is ���naturally���, which was the way they moved. my brother went on playing his video games, but i am changed forever. i have studied and researched \"ufo's\" all my life, with the disclosure project research and other sources under my belt. if i were to tell someone my background in what i know about \"ufo's\", i think it would add less creditability to me, but since i know so much about it, subjectively i have a better chance at determining what i saw. i ask myself, \"why am i so special to have these lights tell me to come out and see them move so naturally and beautifully\"? they wanted me to see them, they wanted me to do what i have been meaning to do, and that is to go back outside, and meditate, and get away from technology like i have before. this was my goal that night and the sighting was a confirmation. this sighting was meant to be personal and even though it was a confirmation of what i should do personally, they came with an obvious message that was given to me, just as the message to go out that night and look up at the night sky. the message that they wanted me to give is that, \"they are definitely here and they are almost ready\". i don't mean to be so dramatic but this is my truth, my reality, my life, my experience and overall this is fact. i immediately started writing about it to get everything that i saw and felt in detail so it will not slip into memory. i just really hope i was not the only special one this night so that this can be collaborated on by many other eyewitnesses. thanks for your consideration to take my account seriously. allan.
