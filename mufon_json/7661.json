Then I saw what appeared to be a half-deflated mylar balloon or perhaps a white garbage bag floating in the air. Suddenly it expaned into a huge white disc and began doing slow graceful movements such as circles and zig-zags. Then another identical disc appeared and they did maneuvers together. I called out to the other workers to come see the flying saucers, and immediately one of them took off and disappeared, while the other one turned on its side and appeared to change into a small plane and slowly move away. The other workers came out and saw the 'airplane' and thought I was an idiot. But I saw what I saw. Oh by the way. There was another supervisor who was with me the entire time who saw everything and reported it to others in the same way."],"Date Submitted":"08/10/2007 11:50 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Fort Collins","There was one other sighting in Fort Collins on or around August 10th 2007"],"Object Shape":"Disc","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Two bright white discs over a field right outside work","Latitude":"40.59262","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-105.078323","Region":"Colorado","City":"Fort Collins"}
