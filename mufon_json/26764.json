As we continued on the freeway, I opened up our sunroof in the car and as we traveled directly underneath I could see the black massive triangular shaped object hovering above with no sound, the lights all turned white. I watched it slowly travel south through the rear window. No longer was the triangle in view only 3 tail white lights. We exited the freeway to get back on heading south (same direction as object)but could not see it any longer. I lived near an SFO for over 20 years and worked for the airlines for a short period of time - this object was NOT A PLANE."],"Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26764.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26764.html"],"Region":"California","Date of the Event":"11/26/2010 09:36 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"San Leandro","Date Submitted":"11/27/2010 08:46 UTC","Log Number":"US-11272010-0016","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in San Leandro","There were no other sightings in San Leandro on or around November 26th 2010"],"Longitude":"-122.156077","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.72493,+-122.156077(26764)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26764) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
