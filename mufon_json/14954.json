{"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14954","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside for a cigarette, and was looking at the stars, I noticed one really bright star (just checked and it is west of Orion at 7:12pm). When I was looking I saw what I thought to be an airplane, I watched it for a minute and didn't see the normal flicker of lights that an airplane would have. I kept watching it and called my wife out to see it as it kept moving east. She came outside and I told her that it could be the ISS or a satellite. It was moving in a straight line, She and I were looking at it as we noticed it became significantly dimmer, and then slowly faded out of sight within 3-4 seconds."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.67348,+-122.072966(14954)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14954) map </A>","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Hayward","There were no other sightings in Hayward on or around January 16th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Log Number":"US-01162009-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14954.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14954_submitter_file2__PassGTrackLargeGraphic.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14954.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/16/2009 07:06 UTC","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-122.072966","Latitude":"37.67348","Country":"United States","Summary":"Looked like a bright star, noticed it was moving eastward at really high altitude","Date Submitted":"01/16/2009 07:06 UTC","Tags":"City","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Hayward","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO"}
