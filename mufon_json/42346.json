It is almost continuous. Every few seconds. A bright white shooting star as well. Multiple small airplanes flying fairly high. These planes are going E to W. Every 3 mins. or so. The flashing light doesn't appear to be lightening as it is very clear out tonight. About as clear as it ever gets. Seeing some chemtrails now though. The high planes I think. Problem with our magnetic field, maybe? So much activity in the sky all happening at once. Thank you."],"Date Submitted":"09/06/2012 09:11 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-75.234316","Object Shape":"Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42346.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42346.html"],"Summary":"Continuing right now.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
