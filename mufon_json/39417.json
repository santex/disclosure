{"Object Shape":"Star-like","divs":["Sighting Detailswhile looking up in the sky on the night of June 16th 2012 at aproximatly 10:30pm I saw a star that began to glow in a very bright orange color and grew in diameter for a few seconds, then it returned to its original glow and size (starlike) and started racing across the sky towards the west very fast, to fast to be a high altitude plane or even a satelite. A few seconds later another starlike light was observed speeding in the same trajectory and moving at the same speed or even faster,all this occured in a 20 second timeframe."],"Case Number":"39417","Summary":"starlike light started to glow in a bright orange and came back to original brightness and left westward very fast","Log Number":"CA-06172012-0018","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39417.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39417.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-71.242796","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Quebec","There were no other sightings in Quebec on or around June 16th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/16/2012 10:30 UTC","City":"Quebec","Country":"Canada","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.803283,+-71.242796(39417)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39417) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/17/2012 03:45 UTC","Latitude":"46.803283","Region":"Quebec","Tags":"City"}
