The solid white light approximately the size of a house was slowly flying in a straight line from North to South at an angle to their bedroom. They were able to watch the object for about two minutes until it passed out of view from their window. As soon as the light was not visible from their bedroom window Ann grabbed a spot light and rushed into the back yard where she continued to watch the light for approximately another three minutes. She flashed the spot light at the light but had no response. She watched the object slowly moving to the south until it disappeared right in front of her eyes. Ann has seen several unknowns around Grants Pass peak since moving into the area about 8 years ago. She enjoys watching them and is very curious as to why there is so much unknown activity around the mountain"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
