{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting details it was last friday night ,may 24 2013,my wife & i were traveling west on cairo hollow rd.(limestone co. in north alabama). as we were going through some trees , up ahead we saw a very bright light in the sky. my wife asked me what it was , & i was just about to reply ,probably a plane w\\ landing lights on, when we saw another one come out from behind the trees ahead. then another one & another & so on.eventually there were about 10 of them in a line. there were 2 or 3 out front then there were 6 in formation , 2 - 2- & 2. it was one then another just behind & above the 1st. there were 6 like this , then there was one by itself kinda taking up the rear. they were extremely bright and a vivid orange. the brightest orange i've ever seen in the sky. there was a full or near full moon that night & they rivaled it's brightness, only they were of a much diferent color. let me say here that i am very familiar w\\ all objects you see in the night sky. i have been an amateur astronomer since i was a kid in the late 60's-early 70's. i have a celestron telescope & have taken a lot of really good photos of nebulae, galaxies, etc. over the years. i also have a background in engineering & was a math major in college. i tell you this to let you know that i know every single thing that you would normally see in the sky.this was nothing i have ever seen before. these things were so unearthly looking, & strange that i can honestly say ,that when we stopped & i got out of the car on this lonely country road, i was actually scared. i mean they looked so unreal. they were heading south at a steady pace but not too fast.depends on how close they were, but they didn't seem to be that far away ,because we seemed to be getting more up under them before we stopped. they were pulsing a bright orange & sometimes got brighter & then dim a bit. they were far bigger than anything in the sky with the exception of the moon.the point on the road where we stopped ,according to google earth was- 34 deg 52min 15sec n & 87 deg 08min 18.58sec w as they got to the south of us the strangest thing of all happened. they just were gone. they were there & then they just were'nt. i have no idea where they went,but i'll tell you this, we were both shaken & a bit unsteady as we started to drive again. i want to stress again that we are not nut jobs or crazy people, just a normal couple (other than being musicians-haha) & this was something i just can't explain. my best friend is a florence ala. police officer & he can tell i don't usually run into things i can't explain. this was not any type of aircraft . when i got out & we turned the car off, they were dead silent , no sound at all.they were not planets ,i know all the planets & besides ,they were moving. they weren't meteors, they were too slow ( unless they were really far off -top of atmosphere)but i think they were much closer.they were not weather. were not fireworks, or flares. i thought of flares when i 1st saw them ,but but soon i could see that they were moving horizontally & intelligently. so anyway, i've gone through everything i can think of ,but i just can't think of anything that fits.the total duration was approx. 2 min. we felt strange for a few days & couldn't stop thinking about it. they were just so strange there are no words to truly describe them.............steve"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Rogersville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-05302013-0016","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Alabama","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.85899,+-87.20867(47743)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47743) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/24/2013 09:00 UTC","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47743.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47743.html"],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"05/30/2013 07:00 UTC","Case Number":"47743","Longitude":"-87.20867","City":"Rogersville","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Summary":"My wife & I were driving west .
