{"City":"Cleveland","divs":["Sighting DetailsMe and my gramma were driving at night..looked towards sky saw a glowing object hovering over trees. Looked like a star but it then glowed brighter and very very slowing seemed to be moving in a straight path over the trees..could no longer take a picture it was cloudy and very dark then disappeared. I knew it wasnt a star it seemed brighter and bigger. Even my gramma thought it was unusual that it actually moved and disappeared over treetops.."],"Object Features":"None","Case Number":"49070","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49070.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/49070_submitter_file1__finepixcamera017.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/49070_submitter_file2__croppedobjectcrop.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49070.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date of the Event":"07/17/2013 08:19 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Cleveland","There was one other sighting in Cleveland on or around July 17th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"Texas","Date Submitted":"07/20/2013 07:40 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"glowing object hovered over trees looked like star","Latitude":"30.34406","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.34406,+-95.081988(49070)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49070) map </A>","Log Number":"US-07202013-0016","Longitude":"-95.081988","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
