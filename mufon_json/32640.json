{"Summary":"Craft sighted with multiple lights blinking sequentially, hovering or moving slowly","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving home from Kansas City to Lawrence, Kansas on highway K-10, heading west near De Soto. I spotted a craft with a series of lights blinking in sequence. The craft appeared to be hovering. I pointed it out to the other passengers in the car and noted that it appeared to be similar to the reports we've read of sightings over Lee's Summit, Missouri. As we neared the De Soto exit, the craft seemed to be moving slowly overhead, moving in a northwest to southeastern direction. If I had to guess, I would say it was several hundred feet up, but it was difficult to gauge size and distance. As we crossed the path of the craft, my wife looked up at it and described it as \"triangular.\" I noted the time to be 8:13."],"Date of the Event":"10/16/2011 08:13 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in De Soto","There were no other sightings in De Soto on or around October 16th 2011"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10162011-0028","Country":"United States","Case Number":"32640","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.987541,+-94.966028(32640)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32640) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32640.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32640.html"],"Date Submitted":"10/16/2011 10:35 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"De Soto","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Kansas","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-94.966028","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"38.987541"}
