And when we stoped for gas and cigerattes for my sisters hisband my sister pointed out about 10-15 mysterious objects hovering in one direction. At first i thought they were ballons but then i realized they were moving to fast and to \"Different\" And when they were hovering the were very shifty. They didnt going in one direction exactly, they were moving side to side and almost tobling. I was always a believer in UFOs. But i never thought I would see one and i certinly never thought i were to see more then a twelve. I was in misbelife when i saw them. My brother in law and sister were also in misbelife.
