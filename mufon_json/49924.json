Object flies northeasterly and has repeated this five nights in a row. Object is an extremely bright white light and when viewed through binoculars seems to have a red area frontward.When viewed with the naked eye appears as a ball or orb of bright white light. As an nightly observer the area is ripe with unknown objects. There are what I call \"flashers\" stationed in the sky nightly and some seem to mimic known constellations like Ursa Major and Minor. They are plentiful and when viewed flash red, white, green. They appear to adjust themselves in the night sky and appear to \"dance\" as though they are trying to maintain position. Have been watching the night sky for four + years and have witnessed many unusual events . At this point I have become accustomed to the \"experiences\" and search for answers. Would like to add that I view the objects with stargazer binoculars and the objects moving are definitely not planes, helicopters,flares."],"Longitude":"-63.597223","Log Number":"CA-08172013-0010","Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.871803,+-63.597223(49924)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49924) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/16/2013 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49924.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49924.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Brilliant glowing moving object","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Other","City":"Wellington"}
