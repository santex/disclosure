When I used the cam coder zoom It looked like two spherical objects attached. The object looked totally like a star so I did not really care much. It stayed in the east side of the sky. However, yesterday the object brightness was changing from very bright for few minutes then the light diminish to almost nothing for few seconds then it gets bright.
