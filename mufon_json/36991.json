It was really late one night while living on the eastside of Detroit,during a drive with a family member. I noticed a red dot in the sky. Being a persistent stargazer I watched it and noticed that it probably wasn't a natural phenonmenon. The dot was hovering initially and I told my cousin to look at it. It started to move westbound, and we followed it for about 2 miles. The red dot split into 3 red dots they then moved along for awhile. Then they returned to a single red dot and flew off fast. There are lights in the sky alot in Detroit especially around the City Airport on the eastside. The lights are usually stationary, glowing a faint red, blue light, that seems to fluctuate in intensity. I've seen as many as 6 out at a time. Several family members have also noticed the strange lights near City Airport. I tried to record on my ancient camcorder and the lights are too faint for me to see. The last time I saw the lights near the airport would've been around June 2011."],"Log Number":"US-03292012-0004","Region":"Michigan","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.341397,+-83.039764(36991)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36991) map </A>","Summary":"UFO sightings","Date of the Event":"03/01/1998 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-83.039764","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
