{"divs":["sighting detailsthe sighting took place just a few days after my 11th birthday.i was playing alone in my parents backyard into the early evening hours when i felt as if someone was watching me.the sun had already set but the sky was still light enough to be able to easily make out features.i turned to the south (and slightly east) looking to see if anyone was there.i saw noone.i turned back around to continue playing when the feeling of being watched intensified and i heard a low sound almost like an electric buzzing (sort of like a denser version of the electrical static heard when standing under\\near high power tension lines). this time when i turned around i not only looked straight ahead but up as i noticed something metallic partly obscured behind and above a large avocado tree in the yard.at first i thought that the \"goodyear\" blimp whas in sight (an object that was quite common in s. florida in those years),but with a different hum.i headed wsw in the yard to gain a better vantage point not obscured by the avocado tree when i realized that this was not the blimp.the object was football shaped and about 10yrds long and 5yrds at the fattest point in the center top to bottom.it was about 1\\2 a mile away and 1200-1500 feet up.the color was a dull metallic that seemed to glow in certain areas for short amounts of time before glowing in another area.i could not make out any set pattern to the glowing areas.the object had no basket\\engine module underneath and no propeller or rudders.in front it had a series of rectangular windows similar to a cockpit's.that area was also slightly jutted out and squared.along the entire front,side and back it had a rim similar to a hat brim widest in the front and less wide all around.i noticed no writing\\marks on the object. at first the object seemed to be hovering and the front was facing nnw and turning slightly towards the wnw.i was felt threatened and was both terrified and frozen for a few minutes.finally i was able to move behind a bush to seek safety (the feeling of danger would not stop).when i looked through the bushes at the object it had stopped turning and hovered there for a while.i gathered my courage and ran to the back of my father's p\\u truck parked in the back yard next to the shed.the object seemed to follow me by facing me at my new vantage poit (i could see its front again)but this time it had also lept forward to be almost directly above.the noise\\humming was now gone and it had traversed this distance (1\\2 a mile) in the blink of an eye.as i gathered up the courage to run for the back door of the house i also screamed and was met by my grandfather who looked up in time with me to see the object head staight up without making a sound and dissappearing from view within seconds.we had just enough time to see what looked like small half round glass orbs on its belly (they resembled the security domes at stores imbedded in the ceilings).once the object had started to rise i felt less panicked and normal."],"Date Submitted":"10/26/1981 06:15 UTC","Summary":"A football shaped object hovered about 100 feet above tree-line then sped off.","Case Number":"8947","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Other","Object Shape":"Blimp, Egg","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"25.705056","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8947.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8947_submitter_file1__sketchesanddrawingsfirst1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8947_submitter_file2__sketchesanddrawingsfirst2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8947.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in South Miami","There were no other sightings in South Miami on or around October 26th 1981","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.290755","Log Number":"US-01162008-0033","Date of the Event":"10/26/1981 06:15 UTC","City":"South Miami","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.705056,+-80.290755(8947)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8947) map </A>"}
