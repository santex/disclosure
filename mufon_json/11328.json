Nothing I know could accelerate that fast and come to a complete stop. I did not hear a sound but my wife claims she heard a hum. They seemed to be miles off. We watched for about 20 minutes they continued to go into and out of formation, and then went to bed. At first I was thinking of going to get a ranger or something then realized how dumb an idea that was in the middle of the night. I thought about signaling with a flashlight but I decided I would not really like them to know I was there. I was kind of excited and a little scared. I'm guessing on the date but we didn't tell anybody for years about our sighting. We were not drinking or on drugs of any kind."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
