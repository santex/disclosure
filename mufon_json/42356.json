Suddenly, the basketball size, light blue ball of light appeared in the sky, moving away from me with astounding speed. Did not observe it for more than a second. First impression for me was \"its a meteorite\". Then, analyzing it in my head I realized, the sky already was light from the Sun and I never seen meteorite that big and and at that low altitude (it was under the cloud cover). And I never seen light-blue meteorites. It disappeared in the sky after short distance, leaving a slight black smoke-like trail, that dissipated withing seconds. We have Edwards Air force base in close vicinity, but I never seen anything like that. At the speed it was traveling and disappeared, one would expect a sonic boom, but there was no sound at all. Never seen anything like that, and decided to report it, while it is still fresh in my mind."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Case Number":"42356","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-118.165757","Summary":"Blue, meteor like.","Log Number":"US-09072012-0005","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.660447,+-118.165757(42356)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42356) map </A>","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Lancaster","There were no other sightings in Lancaster on or around September 7th 2012"],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","City":"Lancaster","Date of the Event":"09/07/2012 06:11 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42356.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42356.html"],"Latitude":"34.660447"}
