They changed their shape into a straight line a fourth red orb appeared , they split up moving around each other . One stood still , the other 3 went back into a triangle formation . As I started to take a picture with my digital camera the triangle stoped moving.One orb grew bigger pulsing red and then my camera just powered off. Tried to turn it back on and it would not do anything.We watched as the triangle looked as if it wasn't going up but down till we couldn't see it .
