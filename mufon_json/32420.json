{"Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Case Number":"32420","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs the other witness said I too have been seeing these lights for 2-3 years now. I saw them but not on the date he said, I saw them on the 5th, they seem to come in those months he mentioned and always around the same time. Was way to windy for these to be flares that didn't move. I too reported this to the news over a year ago and was asked to do a story on KTXS news which I did. I'm assuming it was his video they used on my news story. I was in Abilene at Kirby lake when I saw these at 8:45pm looking east of abilene. Not flares these lights always seem to show up around the same time of the year and around the same time. Always does something different as far as the light patterns go. Something weird going on out here for 2-3 years now. Wish someone with professional equipment would come out and check it out. If you're in the area look east of abilene between 830-915ish."],"trends":["There have been 63 other sightings in Abilene","There was one other sighting in Abilene on or around October 5th 2011"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32420.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32420.html"],"Longitude":"-99.733022","City":"Abilene","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"10/05/2011 08:45 UTC","Latitude":"32.373793","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"10/07/2011 05:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.373793,+-99.733022(32420)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32420) map </A>","Summary":"Orange Lights Again","Log Number":"US-10072011-0009","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
