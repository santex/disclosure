I went into my girlfriend's house and immediately asked for her camera but unfortunately it would not focus on the object, she did however come out and witness the same thing that i saw. All I can say is that it looked like a star, but it was broad daylight High noon, but closer than a star like in our upper atmosphere, we watched for about ten minutes until a cloud passed in front of it and then it was gone. It didn't do anything fancy just kinda hovered there in the same spot, but literally disappeared from one minute to the next."],"City":"Kent","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.388174,+-122.225563(19071)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19071) map </A>","Longitude":"-122.225563","Case Number":"19071","Summary":"stagnent ball of light looked like a star but in broad daylight.","Date of the Event":"09/04/2009 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-09042009-0009","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
