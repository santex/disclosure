As I usually do, I looked up to the sky and happened to notice a very FAST moving object in the sky moving South to North. I initially thought it was a satellite, but it was moving entirely too fast for that. For a second I thought it might be a meteor, but it gave off a red hue and in the same second I had this thought, it changed direction. It didn't change direction sharply, however, it made S curves through the sky. I'd never seen anything like this before and as a 34 year old night owl, an outdoor smoker, someone fascinated by stars, the moon, aircraft, and satellites, I've seen a lot over the years, but I have no frame of reference for this and its speed and direction change defies all human boundaries of flight. I eventually lost sight of the object as it continued on its northern flight path to the more well lit Indianapolis downtown sky."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-02122013-0003","Summary":"UFO over Greenwood/Indy","City":"Indianapolis","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
