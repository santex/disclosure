{"divs":["sighting detailsi was in our back yard going to my shop when i saw a bright light moving across the sky. when i first saw it, it was about due north. it was moving west slowly. i at first thought it was a satellite. then it stopped moving and seemed to be brighter. i watched it for maybe ten minutes. it had a bright white light below what looked to be pulsing or rotating red\\green\\blue. there was no sound. it hovered for a while, then moved a little west, dipped down some, moved up, and then remained just above the treeline. i called out my wife and kids to see it. they all agree it was not characteristic of any airplane or helicopter. it did not move like an airplane would move. if it was a helicopter close enough to see it that bright we would have heard it. aircraft do not have green lights. this is not an area where there are frequent helicopters except the occasional fly over from a medical chopper or sometimes a chopper out of nacogdoches airport. i continued to watch it for an hour. it mostly hovered but slowly moved down behind the treeline. when my wife came out she saw another object very similar through the trees to the west. that one wasn't there as long and it moved away. i did not see where it moved."],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Lufkin","There were no other sightings in Lufkin on or around September 4th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-94.756206","Case Number":"42304","Object Shape":"Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","City":"Lufkin","Summary":"Bright white light below pulsing red/blue/green","Log Number":"US-09042012-0023","Date Submitted":"09/04/2012 11:48 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"31.382245","Date of the Event":"09/04/2012 09:01 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.382245,+-94.756206(42304)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42304) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42304.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42304.html"]}
