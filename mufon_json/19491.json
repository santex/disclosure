Light had a beam shining down from it. Moved into a misty cloud, light began to dim and then went out. Mist traveled for another 15 to 20 seconds and then evaporated, the light and mist were gone. The odd part is that this was a cloudless, star-filled sky. After the mist dissipated, the stars were visible again. Very strange. I was taking trash to the dumpster behind my work. At first I thought helicopter, but then I realized there was no sound at all. I called my wife after the sighting and told her that I just saw something weird in the sky."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/19/2009 08:00 UTC"}
