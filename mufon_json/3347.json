At first we thought it was the tram going up the mountain, but it was too high for that. Then we thought it had to be a plane, but it wasn t moving. And it wasnt a star because it was 4 blinking lights kind of moving around. Then, all of the sudden it zoomed off at an unbelievable speed, making a LUEEEEEEEEEEEEEE sound. I thought it was kind of weird, as I don t believe in supernatural occurances, but I thought I should send it to someone because there is a high-tech military airforce a few miles away, and it might be worthy to look into.
