I notice a red light in the distance going up the hill up really fast and I thought to myself that it must be a CHP chasing some car up ahead. Then the light takes off into the sky so I keep an eye on it while I was driving. From the very distance on my right, the craft made it ways to the right side of the light polls next to my car on the freeway. I would say about fifty yard or so to the right of my car and with the twilight at the time, I was not able to make out the exact shape of the craft except the few lights of the vehicle (similar to the small craft in the Close Encounter of the Third kind movie). When the craft was approaching us I pointed it to my friends and ask them if they are seeing what I'm seeing and my friend confirm \"Yes, what the hell is that?��� I look at my speed and I was going exactly 55 MPH. After a few moments, the craft slow down and cross the freeway from behind me to my left side and after a few moments stop dead in mid air. There weren't any noise from the craft for we turn off the radio. The craft shone 2 search lights making a circular motion from the front and as I was pulling ahead, the craft went from stand still in mid air to continue flying along my left side while keeping a distance so I can't see the details of the vehicle and by now it was dark. The craft move ahead of my car while keeping a distance and cross the freeway in front of us and went back to my right side and after a few moments zoom away out of my vision. And that is the story on my encounter."],"City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.781941,+-119.413832(10951)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10951) map </A>","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
