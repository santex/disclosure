{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe photo I'm submitting was taken in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in northern California looking east. Aerial object unseen at time of photo. As an avid picture taker around here, I have experienced this photographic anomaly many times. However I must say this is the clearest and most defined of such photos. As some previous such photos have shown these aerial objects to be closer to me then this one appears to be, it always blows my mind when I discover them, and wonder for a moment or two if \"they\" saw me taking pictures! That's about the size of it. Thank you."],"Date of the Event":"04/14/2010 12:00 UTC","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22948.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/22948_submitter_file1__070.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22948.html"],"Summary":"Downloaded photo has aerial object","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.779961","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/24/2010 12:59 UTC","Log Number":"US-04242010-0005","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.779961,+-119.416352(22948)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22948) map </A>","Case Number":"22948","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-119.416352","trends":[""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed"}
