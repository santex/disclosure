{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was staring at the clouds, while I was laying on my towel at the public pool. It was a partly cloudy day, and the clouds were moving North-east I believe. Then I noticed two side-by-side metallic spheres moving the opposite direction that the clouds were moving. They seemed as if they might have been 15-25 feet in diameter. I blinked my eyes several times, and I even looked off to the side to make sure it wasn't bubbles in my eyes. It wasn't bubbles in my eyes because I could still see them with my peripheral vision. I watched them until they disappeared behind the treeline. I did a little research finding out that there were no weather balloons which looked like that. Then I wrote it off knowing the truth wouldn't be disclosed anyway, anytime soon."],"Date of the Event":"07/01/2000 04:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Killeen","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.118899,+-97.726376(18790)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18790) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-08212009-0011","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"18790","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18790.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18790.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Killeen","There were no other sightings in Killeen on or around July 1st 2000"],"Summary":"Two metallic non-lighted spheres","Longitude":"-97.726376","Latitude":"31.118899","Date Submitted":"07/01/2000 04:00 UTC"}
