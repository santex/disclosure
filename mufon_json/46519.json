I changed the direction of my camera and shot a few pictures successively. There were two different objects, one which flew from the top down, and 1 minute later, another object that flew from the bottom upwards. I photographed these objects from my window, in the apartment where I live in Cologne. It happened in the East. While taking pictures I thought they were quite normal planes or jets, but then I saw something else in the photos. In the photos they look like flying double-or triple-rods, and do not look like us famous flying objects. In some of the photos you can see many small unidentified flying objects that accompanied the large UFO's. When I saw the result in the photos, I was very excited and decided to report my sighting."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.940221,+6.922919(46519)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46519) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46519.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46519.html"],"Latitude":"50.940221","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
