The lights were as bright as the stars so at first it appeared as a cluster of stars started moving across the sky. As it picked up speed, I realized it was actually moving and was a craft. We live close to a small municiple airport, but I heard no engine noise. It had more lights on it than an aircraft and the lights were only white. The lights were not real bright so they blended in to the stars. Based on the lights not being real bright, I realized what I was watching was probably further away than I first thought and therefore probably a lot larger as well. For reference, at arms length the object appeared to be about 2.5 - 3 inches across. I watched it cross the sky in a southeastern direction."],"Longitude":"-124.22196","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in North Bend","There were no other sightings in North Bend on or around April 4th 2007"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"43.414431","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Diamond","Region":"Oregon","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"04/04/2007 09:40 UTC","Summary":"craft moving southeast across sky","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"6754"}
