I looked down to my GPS to see where my dogs were and than looked back up at the moon and noticed two bright objects appeared below Jupiter forming a triangle. I immediately knew this was strange as I have been watching the moon grow over the last week and have not seen these objects before. I stood there sorta puzzled and than the objects started moving down from Jupiter staying the same distance apart and fading away. I felt as though I was watching an X-files type show and as they dissapeared I got goosebumps. Very, very strange but its nice to know others saw this!"],"Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-10202010-0007","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/19/2010 08:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Saw two bright objects below Jupiter forming a triangle with Jupiter being the top","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Baroda","There were no other sightings in Baroda on or around October 19th 2010"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Michigan","Longitude":"-86.478875","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25988.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25988.html"],"City":"Baroda","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"25988"}
