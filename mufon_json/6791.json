{"Latitude":"48.173986","Case Number":"6791","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/07/2007 06:45 UTC","City":"Camano Island","Disposition":"IFO","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Sphere","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","divs":["sighting detailshere is the report i sent to ufosnw.com date of sighting: april 7, 2007 time of sighting: afternoon (exact time unknown) date sighting reported: april 9, 2007 duration of sighting: 11 seconds location of sighting: camano island, washington (see map) latitude: 48.19 degrees north longitude: 122.5 degrees west number of witnesses: one weather: cloud ceiling 5,000 to 7,000 feet. light rain in area. visibility 8 to 10 miles. description (in witness's own words): i took this footage on the afternoon of saturday, april 7th, 2007. you should be able to see clearly an orb\\balloon? the orb\\balloon was stationary and then rose up. i didn't see this object at the time so i didnt zoom in on it. i was just filming the family farm and happened to notice this while i was viewing my footage. i have a higher quality video also, but i'm not sure if you could view it. it is a 35mb .mod file (from a jvc harddisk camcorder). second report by the witness (in response to my questions): ok the orb is first visible at 3 seconds into the video clip in the middle right hand side of the screen, you will see like a white ball overlapping a power line with water in the background. it is stationary. at 7 seconds you see the object start to rise. watch very closely upper right hand corner at 13-14 seconds and you can clearly see a spherical object against the blue sky. third report by witness: glad you saw what i saw. it is indeed very interesting. the film is taken facing south\\southeast. the closest business is right next to where this was, the camano island fire department, right next to that is a small park and a group of businesses (camano island coffee roasters is one) it is known as terry's corner. the actual farm where i believe the orb is hovering over has an antique shop and the guy raises grass fed beef. the thing that gets me is that i can only really think of one real possiblity for what this could be and that is a weather balloon. but that really doesn't make sense being that it was perfectly spherical (not what i know weather balloons to look like) and it was above my neighbor's farm, and it was hovering for a few seconds, did not rise like a helium balloon would. also the fact that it was a fairly low altitude (50-100 feet?) makes it seem even less likely that it could be a balloon. the only other thing that i can think of, that i don't take seriously is \"swamp gas\"? (because there is a pond right next to that area as you can see from the sattelite view.) this isn't one of those \"lights in the sky\" kinda things, its so clear and at a low altitude, it should be easy to explain away if there is a good explanation. i'm going to go visit the farmer guy and ask if he saw anything (or were launching any weather balloons?) and i'll also call the fire department and ask them since they are right smack dab next to where this happened."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Camano Island","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6791.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6791_submitter_file1__WMVERSION.WMV","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/6791_submitter_file2__orb1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6791.html"],"Summary":"Orb captured on video accidentaly","Longitude":"-122.528214","Date of the Event":"04/07/2007 06:45 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-04112007-0002","Region":"Washington","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.173986,+-122.528214(6791)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6791) map </A>"}
