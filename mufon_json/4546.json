{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI woke up and looked out to see an extremly brigt object that appeared to be changing shape and color. As I watched, this object appeared to be moving very slowly higher in the sky. Occasionally I would see a red dot ant to top of the shape which seemed vertically oblong. I got my digital camera, went otside, zoom in and took two 3.5 megapixel photos about a minute apart.When I process the photos on my computer, and blew them up it was appearant that this was some type of UFO. I have saved the originals and am happy to submit them."],"Summary":"Bright object , moving slowly, larger than a star changing shape and color.","Latitude":"34.970442","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.970442,+-78.945306(4546)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4546) map </A>","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Hope Mills","There were no other sightings in Hope Mills on or around March 15th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4546.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4546.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-78.945306","Object Features":"Appendage(s)","Log Number":"US-03162006-0001","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Hope Mills","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"03/15/2006 04:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"4546","Region":"North Carolina","Date Submitted":"03/15/2006 04:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
