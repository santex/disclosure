At first I thought it was just a firework but then realized it was hovering and moving very slowly. After looking closer it looked like a fireball floating through the sky just over the tree line. Made no noise and moved very slowly. I turned up Grove St and stopped near a corn field looking to my right to see if I could see it again, and it appeared to be hovering over the same area. I did not stick around any longer to see what it would do because I was a little freaked out."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"48764","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Summary":"Appeared as fire or a dull light, floating North","Longitude":"-75.621686","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Slatington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.751175"}
