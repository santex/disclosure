Behind her in the sky at about the height of the tree line I noticed a bright larger sphere moving toward the earth. It was amber in color. Curiously it was going much slower than a meteor. I quickly asked my friend what was this thing. She turned to watch it for a few seconds and then it very oddly turned right and disappeared. Later this evening I went into my backyard to star gaze and saw two meteors streaking across the sky. The object I witnessed in the parking lot definitely did not move as these two meteors."],"Region":"California","Date of the Event":"10/23/2008 07:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-10232008-0019","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Morgan Hill"}
