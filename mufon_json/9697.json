They appeared to flash in one spot and immediately flash in another significantly further away from the original spot. The areas seemed random. We have no way of knowing how far away or up they were, but the event appeared to be unusual. We have a fair amount of air traffic over our home and this looked nothing like the typical large or small plane or helicopter. We watched for approximately 30 minutes. The lights never appeared any further away. They just flashed quickly in one spot and moved to another. From my trajectory on the ground and facing west the flashes were covering an area of four to six feet. Then they simply stopped. I thought maybe a UFO and wondered what a weather baloon looks like. I also considered that maybe the satellite bombing project went wrong. I asked my boyfriend his thought. He said must be a UFO and went inside."],"Date of the Event":"02/21/2008 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/21/2008 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"9697","Summary":"fast moving strobe light clusters","City":"Portsmouth","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Portsmouth","There were no other sightings in Portsmouth on or around February 21st 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9697.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9697.html"],"Log Number":"US-02242008-0005","Region":"New Hampshire","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
