It isn't my house, so my direction may be off. I can confirm it later though. It was the same color as a planet or star, but much larger and brighter. It did not veer or alter speed. At first, I figured it was a jet, except it was moving way too fast. It disappeared behind the trees and we could not find it again. I think it may have been a satellite re-entering the atmosphere, but I figured I would report it anyway. Just in case someone else saw it. On a side note: it looked exactly like three UFOs I saw at a slumber party about 20 years ago. Except those UFOs danced around each other, darting all over the place. About ten junior high boys witnessed those UFOs for a lengthy time. We sighted them when it was dark and were still watching them as dawn came. That sighting also occurred in the Powers area."],"Summary":"Fast moving onject"}
