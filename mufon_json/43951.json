{"divs":["Sighting Details5 Objects were observed taking off approximately 2.5 to 3.5 Kilometers away. Video recording of the objects were taken by two cell phones. 2 videos are 2-3 minutes long. The objects did not all follow the same flight path. Accurate distance could not be determined due to unknown size. I am a military contract and Army veteran and have deployed 5 times to the middle east, when I saw the lights they appeared odd and that is what caught my interest. Only emotions were curiousity. Visual contact was lost when the objects dimmed."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Clayton","There were no other sightings in Clayton on or around November 16th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"43951","Longitude":"-75.08563","Date Submitted":"11/16/2012 08:23 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/16/2012 06:30 UTC","Latitude":"39.665125","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11162012-0014","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","City":"Clayton","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Region":"New Jersey","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.665125,+-75.08563(43951)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43951) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"5 objects were observed taking off and were recorded for approx 3 min","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43951.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43951.html"]}
