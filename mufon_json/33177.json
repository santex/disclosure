{"Region":"New Jersey","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailswhile visiting the cape may county zoo with my wife and grandson, we were in the process of eating our lunch at the picnic tables and i looked up and saw a large plane flying over and i noticed a flask of light. the altitude of the plane was approximately 20,000 feet and flying in a north\\east direction. it was apparent that a silver like cylinder was flying along side the airplane. at first i thought it was a military plane and was being escorted by a military jet but the object had no wings. it was shadowing the large commercial jet towards the rear of the plane. the objects distance from the plane looked to be a full wing span. i could see the sun reflecting off the cylinder and i managed to finally take a few photos but the photos show that i did not capture the object because of todays digital cameras. its almost impossible to see anything on the small screens. i just started shooting photos in the general direction and one photo did capture an object in it. the object looks dark gray in color and it looks to be at a lower altitide than the jet that passed over. i have one original photo and one photo of a rendering of what i actually saw. i have also included a google earth photo of the flight path of the object. i am a chief investigator with mufon in new jersey. if you are not looking up into the sky, you will never see a ufo. the time of day was 1.23 pm and the sky was partly cloudy. no winds notices and the temperature was aprox 65 degrees."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.089804,+-74.821119(33177)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33177) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Middle","There were no other sightings in Middle on or around November 6th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"39.089804","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33177.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33177_submitter_file1__11-6-11CAPEMAYCOURTHOUSE--NEWJERSEY--KENPFEIFERWITNESS.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33177_submitter_file2__UFOOVERTHEZOOHEADINBGNORTHEAST.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33177.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Summary":"observed a silver cylinder flying next to a commercial airliner","City":"Middle","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-74.821119","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Log Number":"US-11062011-0018","Date Submitted":"11/06/2011 08:58 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/06/2011 01:23 UTC","Case Number":"33177","Tags":"City"}
