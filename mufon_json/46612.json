I was riding east when I saw a \"falling star\", so I stopped to look at it. When I stopped, the object was a couple hundred feet from the earth's surface. It then shot west flying right over me. It was the brightest white light I have ever seen. It was silent. It had a trail behind it which resembled glitter. The shape I could barely see was round. I thought to myself, a \"falling star\" does not go East to West. I was extremely calm, the object disappeared in the West. I knew I had seen something special. Never have seen anything like this before. Very glad I saw it!!"],"Case Number":"46612","Date of the Event":"04/03/2013 08:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Scottsdale","Date Submitted":"04/05/2013 10:03 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.514947,+-111.889041(46612)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46612) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Features":"Other","Region":"Arizona","trends":["There have been 42 other sightings in Scottsdale","There were no other sightings in Scottsdale on or around April 3rd 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46612.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46612.html"],"Country":"United States"}
