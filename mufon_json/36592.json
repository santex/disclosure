{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile on my deck in the south hills, looking east, northeast. I witnessed a bright object come into view, I watched this star like object that appeared to be pulsating red green and blue lights, slowly move vertically, seeming to stop occasionally and then continue to move vertically over a 40 minute time period in which i watched the object, before i went inside. There were multiple planes in the sky, some moving towards and away from me. This object looked nothing like any of the planes in the sky around me. It was very bright, and pulsating. Moving very slowly in a hovering, vertical motion. I tried to take a picture of the object, but it was so small that my camera couldn't really pick it up."],"Log Number":"US-03192012-0022","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Case Number":"36592","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"40.37952","Date Submitted":"03/19/2012 09:32 UTC","City":"Pittsburgh","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/19/2012 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Summary":"Steady bright light with flashing/pulsating red, green and blue lights.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36592.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36592.html"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.37952,+-80.052106(36592)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36592) map </A>","Longitude":"-80.052106","trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There was one other sighting in Pittsburgh on or around March 19th 2012"]}
