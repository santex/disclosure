I parked the car in the alley and started walking towards the house. I then spotted two pulsating red lights hovering. I rushed to the house to tell my mom. She was inside watching her primetime show. We ran outside and that is when we notice that there were more red lights pulsating. We grab the camera and started filming. They started to go left towards Palmdale. Then we spotted the next set of pulsating lights. behind the first object. We also recorded that object. We noticed that a white solid light followed the red lights. After we lost sight of the objects, we heard helicopters and other crafts flying around."],"Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/29/2011 07:35 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Santa Clarita","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"32201"}
