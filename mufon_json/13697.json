I didn't see or hear anything and was only stopped for a few minutes. When I got home and uploaded the pictures to my computer I instantly noticed something wasn't quite right. There was a black and silver object somewhere between 5,00 and 10,000 feet up, flying at almost a 45 degree angle. Although its very small in the picture you can tell its not a plane. In the background you can see another object about a mile or two away. In another picture that was taken about a minute after you can't see anything until you zoom in, then it appears. The object had moved over a mile in less than a minute and had leveled out. I thought about calling the airport and the police station to see if they had any other reports that day, but decided against it figuring I would be added on to a list of crazy people."],"Case Number":"13697"}
