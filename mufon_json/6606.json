{"Date of the Event":"02/28/2007 03:30 UTC","Summary":"two saucer shaped object hovering and drifting East over Hollywood.","Case Number":"6606","Region":"California","divs":["Sighting DetailsPlease call me. I've been trying again and again to send you the pictures .No way. Something's not working with the attachment section.... They were two far away objects high in the sky with weird behaviour. I first thought they were birds of prey. Then i realized they could not be birds or planes as they don't come in round black \"donut\" shapes...or was it red triangles? They seemed to be shifting shapes! I rushed into the house to grab my camera and my roommate. We stepped outside and saw...A red and black donut shaped \"Whatizit\" and an arrow shaped one. I would like to think they were balloons, but they really looked weird. The second object ( I mean the one that was following the other) turned bright and disappeared into a cloud in a flash !! ?? That was far from us and we could not believe our eyes. On the pictures they really look like saucers!!! Someone else than us must have seen those. This was right over Hollywood in the middle of a sunny afternoon,on Feb 28 2007. 2 witnesses here..."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6606.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6606.html"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Circle","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-118.242015","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around February 28th 2007"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03232007-0002","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.055044","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"02/28/2007 03:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.055044,+-118.242015(6606)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6606) map </A>","City":"Los Angeles"}
