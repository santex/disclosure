It was about 7:43 PM on August 21, 2008. It was very overcast so I came home after shooting 40 frames.After I shot the 40 frame series of photographs and while looking through them later I noticed an object in the sky in one of my shots. I am attaching the original photograph and a tightly cropped image of what I saw in the picture. Also I am including an original photo shot from the exact location of the one in which the object showed up. I am not sure of what it is but it looks like a UFO to me.
