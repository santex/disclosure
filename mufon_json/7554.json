I thought it could be a plane. My balcony faces east. I started to film the light and it flashed and blinked on and off and moved erratically about the sky. Changing from smal blinking light, to big blinking light to a really big multicolored light and moving back and forth across the sky. I noticed after uploading the video that in the beginning up and to the right of the main object another dim flashing light zooms off screen. While observing the light I felt curious and determined to film it to see exactly what it was. I don't feel it was a plane at all."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Aspen Hill","Date of the Event":"07/21/2007 08:21 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"On my 2nd floor balcony noticed light in eastern (I think) sky started filming","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7554.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7554_submitter_file2__StillDiskA072107UFO016.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7554_submitter_file3__StillP072107UFO011.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7554.html"],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/21/2007 08:21 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.088913,+-77.063584(7554)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7554) map </A>","Case Number":"7554","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.063584","Latitude":"39.088913"}
