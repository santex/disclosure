I had taken several at the beginning of December and was reviewing some with the moon setting when I saw a small object in the sky in the photo. When I enlarged the object I could see the object was not a star and does not appear to be an airplane but is clearly three-dimensional. I was not aware of the object's presence when I took the picture of the setting moon. It has a very odd shape that I have never seen before."],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"California","City":"Joshua Tree","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.07555","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"01/06/2013 04:16 UTC","Case Number":"45057","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.07555,+-116.321854(45057)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45057) map </A>","Object Shape":"Oval, Saturn-like, Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
