I looked up at the stars, as I always do, when I observed red light coming across the sky (direction NE to SW). I, at first, thought it was a helicopter but it made no noise and the light was not flashing. My wife and I stood and watched to see where it was going or what it was going to do when it stopped, just hovered, and then moved back and forth a bit. I couldnt believe it. I looked around for anyone who might be out walking so they could see it as well but no one was around. As we watched, my wife thought the orb was getting smaller but I remarked that no, it was moving straight up and away from us, very fast. We stood and watched as it got smaller and smaller and then just disappeared."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Date Submitted":"09/10/2013 09:01 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.395174,+-81.737228(50734)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50734) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50734.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50734.html"],"Summary":"Round red light with slight white glow around outside edge","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"41.395174","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09102013-0011","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Parma","There were no other sightings in Parma on or around September 9th 2013"]}
