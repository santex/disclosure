It was a warm Summer night.I was staring at the night sky. I noticed a violet light which seemed to be very far out. You could tell it was in space by the distance. The color was close of that to a black light as it seemed almost fluorescent, it was traveling quite fast for the distance at which I took it to be. It's path was straight and I watched it for about 5 minutes.I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I noticed a neighbor down in the driveway and yelled to him.I asked if he could see what I saw but I was on the fourth floor and there was a building blocking his view.He thought I was crazy and didn't want to come look. I looked back and the object was still there,I had to find it again and noticed as I watched it that it split into two. The second object continued with the first then angled off then shot away in reverse direction at a 45 degree angle deep into space, as from my perspective. The first object then increased in speed and disappeared from view as well."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-70.65781","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Wareham","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
