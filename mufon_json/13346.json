We were headed W on highway 377 when at around 7:50 pm we saw a series of strange lights. The best way that I could describe it is that there were about 3 sets of lights, with each set having about 3 white lights each. They were in a sort of semi-circle shape. All 3 sets never were shining at the same time. It was the first set on the far left that caught my attention. Then they started blinking every couple of seconds back in forth in no particular order. this lasted for about 20 seconds or so. What was really funny was that I got my phone out to take a picture, and right when I pulled it out they were gone. Immediatley after they dissapered we saw 2 planes flying very low to the ground. We live out in the country, so once we got home we sat outside to see if we could see anything else. The planes patroled the area for a good 20 minutes or so. The lights were so close that I seriously think they werent but maybe two to three football field lenghts away. It was pretty neat and scary at the same time!"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Circle","Longitude":"-98.340928","Summary":"3 sets of 3 white lights blinking back and forth","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/28/2008 07:50 UTC","Region":"Texas","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/28/2008 07:50 UTC"}
