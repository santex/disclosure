And I looked up and saw a massive \"v\" shaped object hovering out side of the city....... There were 6 bright white on the bottom. 3 on each side of \"V\". It was a dark color black or drak grey...... I saw for at least 30 seconds it may have there longer..... As I was watching there wasnt any noise, just light traffic....... Then is just vanished...... After that I was still driveing and looking and I could see planes where the object was..i counted at least 10 or more planes and they were what looked like searching. When I got home the planes where still there and were there for like an hour ..... I wish I was not driving so I could filmed it and taken pictures...... But hands down the coolest thing I have seen..... I always did believe in that stuff..... But not now I am 100% positive...."],"trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in York","There were no other sightings in York on or around January 25th 2012"],"Longitude":"-76.721085","Date Submitted":"01/26/2012 10:34 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35284.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35284.html"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"35284","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.966068,+-76.721085(35284)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35284) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"V shaped object hover out side of city","Date of the Event":"01/25/2012 06:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-01262012-0024","Latitude":"39.966068","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
