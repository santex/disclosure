The next morning I visited the same area and noticed a circle with a purplish tint approximately 10 ft. in diameter. It remains today after 3 weeks from time it first appeared. My neighbor said he saw a bright light above the hill on the night of Wednesday, August 14, very late that night when he drove home. He said the light came over and eveloped his truck inside from above. I have taken and preserved a sample of the \"purple dust\" that still exists on the grass leaves."],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.27773,+-82.452621(50382)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50382) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"09/03/2013 01:07 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Elkhorn City","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
