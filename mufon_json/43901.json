The ranch was a large ranch, almost 1000 acres, and was out in the middle of nowhere in eastern Central California, Fresno being the closest large town (city) about 35 minutes north. My UFO story begins one night during harvest that lasted three days. (Wine grapes are harvested at night when the fruit���s sugar is at its highest.) My experience started one night about 2am while I was out watering down the roads driving a large tractor and that pulled a large water tanker that sprayed water onto the roads to keep the dust down during harvest. I was at the eastern most edge of the ranch listening to my Sony Walkman ( I think I was listening to Boys to Men���) when I noticed a red light out in the field to the east of me looking out towards the Sierra Mountains. This red light did not look too far away, probably out about a half a mile. I was driving south and was watching the red light thinking it was helicopter and pondering how strange it was that it was out in the field. Then I noticed the red light was coming closer to me and I began to get nervous. Never for a moment did I believe this was an alien craft, but rather a helicopter piloted by humans that were about to fly over me, and even harass me out in no-mans-land. The red light got closer and closer and suddenly when it was about 100 yards out the red light turned into a bright white light shining in my direction. I was then positive these people in this helicopter meant no good and wanted to harass or even harm me, so I put the tractor in high gear and took off back to the office that was nearly two miles away. I got back to the office and began to recall what occurred and it was then that I began to realize or ponder if what I saw was actually a UFO. I never saw the helicopter, nor did I hear it, all I saw was the red light coming towards me that suddenly turned white which gave me a very formidable feeling. Absolutely creeped out I didn���t go back out to the vineyards that night and fell asleep in the office. The next day I didn���t think too much about what happened and went back to work that night watering down the roads as I had the night before. I remember staying out of the eastern most portions of the ranch and staying close to the harvesters where all the workers and machines were hard at work. It was then that I had the most bizarre experience of my life. I was watering down one of the main roads where the gondolas dumped the grapes into the bins of the big rigs to be taken to the winery. There were four harvesters that night; one would start down a row followed by the second, third, and finally the fourth. As the fourth harvester went into the vineyard I was approaching from about 50 yards away. All the bright lights of the machinery and tractors lit up the area and there I saw hovering over the harvest about 40 feet in the air and 100 feet from me a dark gray circular spacecraft about the size of a large SUV. It appeared to wobble in the air and it was shaped like two bowls glued together with a short cylindrical top. I could see rivets and round nodules protruding here and there, something you would relate to sensors. I could see no windows, just dark gray metal and its alien characteristics. Terrified, I began to get my tractor closer to the workers wanting to point out what I was witnessing, but something inside of me made me pull away from them, fearing they would panic by seeing the hovering craft. Remembering that moment I don���t think I have ever been that genuinely scared before or since. Again, I raced back to the office and played sick so I didn���t have to return to work. The third day, still pretty frazzled from the previous night I was out and about the ranch on one of the ATVs, feeling rather safe from the daylight I was looking about the sky, and there high in the sky above the riverbed that ran along the vineyards was the craft. I was far enough away where it didn���t frighten me so I stared for a moment when almost instantly flew off into the distance disappearing from sight. There you have it, my UFO story. To this day, 20 years later, that memory still boggles my mind. Did I actually see a UFO? Did I see a spacecraft piloted by or operated by intelligent beings from another planet? What exactly did I see? Did that really happen? I suppose I will never really know. I���ve told my story to people throughout the years and I���m pretty sure they look at me like I���m insane. Once I told my social psychology professor about my experience and he said I was in a wakeful dream state and it was all a dream or hallucination. I know what I saw really happened, I know what I saw was real, but it is still hard to grasp what seeing such a thing really means. If what I saw was real over that three day period, then that means the reality in which we live in is very different than the reality that our society has been brought to believe. All of which is fascinating. Thank you for reading my about my experience! Sincerely, Chris H.
