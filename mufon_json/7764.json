In my back yard in South San Jose near highways 85 and 87. At approximately 1:00am Sunday morning I was stargazing. 2.) I was already looking up at the night sky. 3.) At first I thought it was a flashlight or searchlight moving across the bottom of the cloud, but then I realized there was no beam coming from the ground upwards, and that the \"light\" remained just as bright even when it passed through the cloudless part of the night sky. 4.) I was amazed I could not see any physical object as I could see clouds and stars \"through\" it, as though it was invisible except for it's vapor trail. 5.) It moved very swiftly across the sky. There was no sound like from a plane or helicopter and it was not like a solid ball of light as you might expect from a comet or meteorite. It remained a constant speed, size and intensity. 6.) It eventually seemed to disappear into the clouds where I lost track of it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7764.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7764_submitter_file1__UFO_07_22_071.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7764.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.304628,+-121.844874(7764)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7764) map </A>","Longitude":"-121.844874","Tags":"City"}
