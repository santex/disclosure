One light remained stable and secure to the left of a hazey white light appearing from ground level. They all would come in from the right of this haze and go down behind tree cover and disapear into that light. They would come back out of the light also. Others moved all around the bright light (R). circling it like it was its parent. All of a sudden a dim light appeared coming straight towards me and my daughter. then an airplane passed by it and it turned abrubtly and slowly started following small airplane. They would go dim and start blinking very quickly and the others would signal in return like morse code with lights. IT WAS AMAZING! Came back inside at 930pm. They all faded and then started back up around 10pm."],"Case Number":"45273","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-122.634159"}
