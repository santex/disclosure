They made a wide turn using the Capital Building as a reference, coming from the South West and going back to the South West. The crafts appear to be ���V��� shaped. I could not hear any noise. One other person who worked at the Post Office saw the same thing at her home that same time that night. Not to far from Harrisburg is the Letter Kenney Army Base. This base is supposed to refurbish military equipment. However, in the back of the base are underground bunkers with two large hanger doors. They also have a large landing pad in front of the doors. No helicopters are present at the area. The place is restricted and not even the State Police know what is going on in this underground bunker. This base is South West of Harrisburg and this is the direction where the strange crafts were coming from and the direction where they went. Also in the Harrisburg area at the same time, rope style vapor trails have been seen in the sky in early morning. No conventional air craft make such trails."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24808.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24808.html"],"Date of the Event":"02/20/2005 05:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 26 other sightings in Harrisburg","There were no other sightings in Harrisburg on or around February 20th 2005"],"Log Number":"US-07282010-0005","Longitude":"-76.881278","Date Submitted":"07/28/2010 01:22 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.27931,+-76.881278(24808)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24808) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","City":"Harrisburg","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile"}
