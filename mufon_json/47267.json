{"Summary":"a bright object descended really fast then flew a straight line fast","Object Features":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving along Champlain blvd. in LaSalle Montreal. I noticed a plane in the sky but also another object beneath it. My first thought was that it was a helicopter, but it was really going fast. The plane was flying at 45-50 degrees above the object was like 25-30 degrees above the horizon. This object descended really fast like it just dropped, to about 10 degrees above the horizon and flew at a really fast clip to the north. I watched it for about 3-4 minutes before it disappeared beneath the horizon. I kept thinking that I don't recall planes flying that low at that speed over a city. Just wonder if anyone else saw this."],"Object Shape":"Oval","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City","Log Number":"CA-05082013-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47267.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47267.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"47267","Date of the Event":"05/07/2013 10:30 UTC","Latitude":"45.51179","Region":"Quebec","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/08/2013 10:10 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.51179,+-73.545792(47267)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47267) map </A>","trends":["There have been 47 other sightings in Montreal","There were no other sightings in Montreal on or around May 7th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Montreal","Longitude":"-73.545792"}
