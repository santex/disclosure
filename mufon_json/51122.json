We then headed south on Freshly toward the Wal-mart on State Street and used the phone to video it. We drove into the parking lot between JC Penny and the Dollar store and just watched it. It didn't seem to be moving, and we couldn't tell if it had been moving or just been stationary the whole time because we were moving in the car? There were 3 cars pulled over to the side on Freshly when we were headed toward state street and the people seemed to be pulled over looking at the same thing we were."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.919346,+-81.103661(51122)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51122) map </A>","Region":"Ohio","Case Number":"51122","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/26/2013 08:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-09272013-0012","Object Flight Path":"Stationary"}
