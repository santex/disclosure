{"Source":"MUFON","City":"Kunming","divs":["Sighting DetailsIn May , 2011 I went to Yunnan province for travelling. It was the time when I went to small minority tribe village. I took some pic. and I came back to my home Seoul, Korea. I organized my pics which were taken for Yunam travelling. and I found that pic. I tried to enlarge my pic. and that point shaped like triangle. I've been wondering since finding that pic. I believe that the point is not dust on lens. and as you can see distance was too far to see like kite or any plane. Please find my pic out and reply your view thank you for helping me."],"Date of the Event":"05/21/2011 02:58 UTC","Log Number":"CN-06132011-0005","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Kunming","This sighting has never been favorited."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.037721,+102.722202(29523)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29523) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29523.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29523_submitter_file1__064.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29523.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"25.037721","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"102.722202","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"China","Summary":"shaped triangle ufo.","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Triangle","Case Number":"29523","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Yunnan","Date Submitted":"06/13/2011 01:44 UTC"}
