{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI stepped out of my apartment to have a cigarette, it was cold. I glanced at the sky as I do frequently and saw a glowing object that was moving. It was not a clear night, there was a dull grey cloud covering. The object did not move erratically, no flashing lights no associated anomalies just a glow which I observed for less than a minute until I lost it behind a mass of clouds or it disappeared on its own. It was not a satelitte or the space station. I would have reported it sooner but have been offline until recently. This was the first time I had seen anything that I could not identify or reason away. I was of course enthralled and promptly phoned a friend of mine who is ex military and a pilot, described the event to him and he was skeptical but receptive. It was a startling event being the first time I personally had experienced anything solid. Vivid dreams are compelling but just that, dreams. This was really there."],"Country":"United States","trends":[""],"Date of the Event":"11/15/2007 08:15 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-85.597664","Log Number":"US-03122008-0006","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.554766,+-85.597664(9917)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9917) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9917.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9917.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/15/2007 08:15 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","Case Number":"9917","Summary":"Glowing object, moved across the sky south to north.","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.554766","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00"}
