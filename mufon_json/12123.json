{"Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was working the early shift at Tim Horton's. So I left the house about 5:30am. I was riding my bike. As I was turning onto a major street, I stopped dead in my tracks. I had to look upwards. It was over the lake.(Nippissing) I rubbed my eyes a few times thinking it was a trick. I saw a few cars go by and slow down at this time. I got off my bike and stared. It hovered. It looked like a balloon filled with the same stuff they use in street lights. It kept me staring for about 10 minutes. Then it was gone. No sound. No bright flash. I was left there stunned. I couldn't remember where I was going or what I was suppose to be doing. I finally got my stuff together, and got on my bike and rode to work. I didn't notice I was shaking, until a co-worker mentioned it. I told her what I had seen. She said it was probably a weather balloon. I called the next day and found out that the weather balloons are let go in Sudbury. Not North Bay. Any info would be greatly appreciated. I also have more....."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"CA-08182008-0013","Case Number":"12123","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12123.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12123.html"],"Latitude":"46.317645","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-79.45793","Date Submitted":"06/08/2000 12:00 UTC","Summary":"It looked like a glowing white baloon in the sky","Country":"Canada","Date of the Event":"06/08/2000 12:00 UTC","City":"North Bay","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.317645,+-79.45793(12123)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12123) map </A>","Region":"Ontario","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in North Bay","There were no other sightings in North Bay on or around June 8th 2000"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
