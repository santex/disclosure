We had been looking at the planes and stars for awhile when I first saw it. A little ball of light north of us heading west. It was very high up, but we noticed it wasn't blinking like the planes. It was much higher than any of the planes was and traveling much faster. But what really convinced me it was not a plane or helicopter was when it stopped in mid flight. It just hovered there for about 20-25 seconds and then started shooting back and forth very quickly. Faster than anything I have ever seen before. First to the north, and back to the south. It repeated the motion about 10 times for no apparent reason. Then continued on it's path westward for about 30 more seconds, then started to grow dimmer, as if it was rising. Then in less than a second, it was gone. I'm not going to lie, I was pretty scared. Me and my friend agreed to not talk about it, but about 2 minutes later, I happened to look to the south and saw another object heading west as well. This one was much brighter and gave off a bright orange-red glow. This one appeared to be much closer than the first, and was traveling much faster. We observed it for about 50 seconds, until it stopped, shot up, and disappeared like the one before. After that, we were so spooked that we got out, and went inside. A couple things I noticed that convinced me it wasn't a plane were the fact that it made no noise, made no trail like the planes, were so high, went so fast, made a constant glow instead of blinking, ascended so high that they disappeared, and jerked back and forth as fast as the one did. I am very sure this was NOT of this planet."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31563.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31563.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Me and a buddy were swimming around 10pm and saw 2 strange lights.","Case Number":"31563","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"40.425367","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date of the Event":"08/15/2011 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-09052011-0021","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown"}
