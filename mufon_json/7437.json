(we live in the country & can see for miles on a clear night such as this). after approx 5-10 minutes, as i turned to take photos in the east, i noticed this very, very, widespread flashing in the eastern sky, behind my house. what made this so unusual, was the coloring and the way it flashed. if it had not been a perfectly clear night, i would have wrote it off to heat lightning...as it resembled heat lightning perfectly, almost to a tee. the flashing was very widespread in the sky, and as i walked towards the backyard, i could actually see this flashing from way up in the atmosphere\\sky, all the way down near the ground (thru our trees\\woods) as well, (we own just under 5 acres)...this i found to be very odd....and it seemed to be concentrated only in this area the entire time. i continued to watch it, and took photos, which did not show the flashing in the sky at all...i did however, capture lots of brilliant energies & orbs. as i was outside, a friend of mine, who lives 4 miles (3.8 to be exact)\"northwest\" of me, called me on my cellphone. she had taken her dogs outside one more time, before retiring for the night, when she too noticed this unusual flashing far off in the southeastern sky. she had summoned her entire family outside with her, and then she called me because she said it looked like it was over my way, and she, as well as her family, were puzzled by the strangeness of it as well. the flashing as i said, was intermittent. it would flash for a few minutes, then would stop for a few minutes, sometimes for 5 or more minutes. as our cellphone conversation continued, i headed back into my home, and asked my family and a friend, to please come outside and see this as well. as i said, the flashing reminded me exactly as heat lightning would. it covered a good area of the sky, yet i could also see fashing down thru' my woods. the color of the flashing, was a pinkish\\slight reddish\\white. it continued to flash intermittedly on & off for a good 30-45 minutes...but became more steady before it quit altogether. i went through everything, that i thought could, trying to rationalize this flashing, but to no avail. after doing some follow-up calls and investigating over that weekend, i followed up with a call to the clinton county sheriff disptcher on monday, and confirmed there was nothing to explain this \"lightshow\". i do know, and have since confirmed, that it was not fireworks, bonfire, strobes, lasers, flashers...nothing conventional that could explain this. patty d. mufon fi"],"Tags":"City","trends":[""],"City":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-07142007-0004","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"32.320881","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/14/2007 08:13 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
