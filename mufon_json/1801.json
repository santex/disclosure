{"divs":["Sighting DetailsTraveling east on Old Route 60 in truck with mother at dusk. Still light outand sky clear but sun went behind mountains. I looked out windshield to seefirst star to make wish. I saw dull grey triangle with rounded corners, dome incenter of underside, and multi-colored flashing lights around rim almostdirectly above us. I said, Mom. What the hell is that? She looked and said,Oh my God! Oh my God! and I told her to pull over. We pulled over in front of7-Eleven and got out. UFO was moving slowly overhead to NE with no sound. Ilooked around to see if anyone else saw it but no one was looking (one guy waswalking into 7-Eleven). The craft travelled in straight line slowly NE untiltip of front went over mountain. It looked as if it was direclty over themountain very close. Then it shot off at ungodly speed in that direction anddisappeared."],"City":"Rand","Date of the Event":"08/01/1985 07:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"08/01/1985 07:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Dome","Latitude":"38.286667","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1801.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1801.html"],"Log Number":"","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Unidentified flying triangle in 1980s","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"West Virginia","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-81.561667","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.286667,+-81.561667(1801)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1801) map </A>","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Rand","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Case Number":"1801","Source":"MUFON"}
