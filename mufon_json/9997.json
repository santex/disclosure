1,500 ft or aircraft carrier sized, only wider than an aircraft carrier (the uss nimitz is 1,092 ft long). we stood there speechless watching in fascination as the 3 craft (object and 2 fighter escorts) flew almost directly over us. when it was over we all turned and looked at each other and someone said \"what the heck was that?\" i think that the realization that it was obviously a man-made craft kept us from being scared, my reaction was one of fascination and excitement at seeing such a huge object, obviously of human origin flying just above us. wonder about the technology behind such a device and what the heck is it used for and how do they keep something so big a secret. we lost sight of the object when it flew over the mountain that we were at the base of. the obejct and it's jet escort were traveling in a southeasterly direction. we observed the craft and it's escort for about 1 - 1.5 minutes while they flew almost directly over us. it looked like they were flying so slowly that the fighter jets were struggling to stay in the sky, but on further reflection, i think this also was an illusion due to the enormous size of the object. other things i remember: at the center of the fuselage on the underside, there was a soft white light emitted from rectangular area directly between the wings, about as long as the wing attachment and about 1\\2 as wide as the fuselage. the sides were vertical from the bottom of the object straight up, until it met the \"roof\". the back end of the object was flat and looked like a steel farm building, complete with pointed roof. none of us had been drinking at that point and we were not using any other mind-altering substance. we all saw it and remarked upon it and have discussed it many times since. this object was definitely man-made, but is not listed in any catalog of military aircraft that is available to the public. besides the three of us, i have talked to 2 other people who live relatively near taos (within 75 miles), that have seen either the same object or something very similar, both of these witnesses also saw fighter jets escorting the object at the time of their encounter as well. unfortunately, we did not have any type of camera with us at the time (last time i ever go hiking without one!). but i have provided a drawing of what the object looked like. in the 2 years since i have seen the object, i have reflected on what we saw that night and i have wished many times that i had carried a camera with me that night. however, i probably would have been too dumb-struck to actually use it had i had one. i and my hiking partners all feel that this object was man made and some type of secret military aircraft with technology that was far more advanced than anything we have been led to believe is currently available."],"Date Submitted":"09/21/2006 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9997.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9997.html"],"Log Number":"US-03202008-0016","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet -
