When they said they saw something in the sky. They were lights that changed formation but gathered up, they didn't leave each other. Then my sister called me out to see, I saw it last and saw it in a V formation. I saw these dull lights floating in v formation, they seemed dull or hazy because there was foggy clouds. I clearly saw them. They seemed to go over the clouds but my mother said they were under. They left heading towards downtown Los Angeles direction. I was shocked at what I was seeing because it was so odd I didn't know what to think. At last I lost sight of it after heading past a big cloud."],"trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around March 13th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46213.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46213.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Other","City":"Los Angeles","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"46213","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-03152013-0006","Region":"California","Object Features":"Other","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
