{"Country":"United States","divs":["sighting detailsi was at the aziscoos campground in milton mills, me at campsite #5, next to the bennet-bean covered bridge. just after sunset i was star gaizing the partial moon and gadging my silouette in the moon light. it was partly clowdy and i was watching the moon dissapear and reappear through the clouds and was spotting the emerging stars in the after twilight. i first had spotted some falling stars falling from the east just a little to the southern lattatude from me. it was then when i spotted what i first thought was a double star emerge above the horizon to the west. soon i learned that it was rising fast into the sky. as it grew closer i could see that there were more than two lights. when it was almost completely overhead i couled see more that two lights. actually there were two sets of lights; the forward set of lights were tightlr grouped of an unknown number that resembled an arrowhwead, and the rear set of lights were widly space apart in diamond formation it reminded me of the supersonic bomber \"valkyrie.\" the most forward of the rear lights was strobing a yellowish light(that i estimated as the center of it's mass) while all of the others were shining a blueish white light. at first it was silent, but then as it grew closer there was the sound of a jet like engine. but it soundede quite distant as it flew by. when it passed, the aircraft was clearly the source of the rumbling noise. the craft flew from the west to the east at about 5000 ft. it gave me the impression of a delta wing aircraft( with the diamond formation of lighta) with a forward canard (as the arrowhead.) from it's height i wuold estimate it's size as between a 707 and 747 by the spacing of it's lights. but i could not get an exact out line of the craft. i could only judge it size by the lights. it traveled from horizon to horizon below the clouds cover from the west and traveled due east over the rangley lakes region of me. it flew at a subsonic speed as it gave no sonic boom, but it was fast. this aircraft did not conform to any faa approved navagational lighting of red\\blue - port\\starboard arraingment. no marking were notised. i have live in boston, ma and in manchester nh, both of which have major airports. i have seen aircraftof all sizes and this one was like something i've never seen before."],"Case Number":"23385","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-70.962969","City":"Milton","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Milton","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Latitude":"43.500604","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05202010-0013","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/20/2010 11:31 UTC","Summary":"Low flying aircraft, sub sonic- but big.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.500604,+-70.962969(23385)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23385) map </A>","Region":"Maine","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23385.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23385.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/19/2010 09:05 UTC"}
