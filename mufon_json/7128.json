I was looking out my window and I noticed something unusual in the sky it wasnt moving it was kind of just hovering in one spot. The initial thing that made me notice it was the colorful lights that were flashing brightly off of it almost projecting. Im not sure of all the colors but I definately saw blue and red and I know it wasnt a plane be cause it was there for a long period of time. Then at one point I noticed it move a little a bit to a left then up a little but it mainly stayed in the same area. The color intervals of the lights were changing rapidly, blue and red being the two most common of the bunch. After a while I stopped looking, and at about 2am I looked to check and it was gone. The approx area would be around simonds high school. thank"],"Summary":"colorful flashing lights","Country":"Canada","Region":"New Brunswick","Case Number":"7128","Log Number":"CA-06012007-0001","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/01/2007 09:05 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like, Other, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.277655,+-66.062088(7128)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7128) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Source":"MUFON","City":"St John","Latitude":"45.277655","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in St John","There were no other sightings in St John on or around"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7128.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7128.html"]}
