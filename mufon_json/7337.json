{"Summary":"Three spectacular UFO sightings and possible alien June 20 near K.C.","divs":["sighting detailssighting #1: 10:00 pm or slightly before. my brother frank, age 45, and daughter maria, age 30, and myself were sitting out in our back yard patio around a table talking when my brother jumped up and said \"what the heck is that!\", looking up at the sky towards the north from our home in independence, mo. my daughter and i then jumped up to look and we saw a very large, very bright white circular object traveling from west to east. this was two-three times the brightness of venus, and the size of approximately 4 747's, or three-four times the size of venus. there was a smaller, less bright object following approximately 500 ft behind and slightly left of the larger object that did not change position. i guessed them to be at about 1000 ft. we noticed a jet airliner way above these objects. the ufo's were moving at a fairly fast clip - and we ran across the driveway into the street (about 100 ft) to catch sight of the objects through the trees but lost them. the sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds or slightly more. i found out the next day that the iss was traveling in the same area at nearly the same time, however, these objects were way too low and too bright to have been the iss and shuttle. now for the really strange part: a couple of minutes before this happened my husband told us he was going to the warehouse to check on something. i thought it was odd because it was so late, but i thought he would be right back. i was mad that he missed this sighting by two minutes -he always seems to miss stuff like this. now when we ran through the driveway i saw his work van there and so thought he had not left yet. after we lost sight of the objects, the three of us moved out of the street into the driveway and were talking about what the objects could have been, when i noticed that my husband walked from the driveway up the porch steps to the side of the house. it was dark outside, but not pitch dark-- and light was coming out of the sliding doors on the porch so the area had some illumination, but what i could see was as a black outline of a person and he was walking strangely. then i noticed that my car was missing. i said \"wait a minute, where is gene?\" to my brother and daughter. they said \"he must have left in your car.\" at that point, i got a very creepy scary feeling and actually started to shake. now i don't scare too easly, but this was different. as i thought about it i realized that whatever it was had long arms down to the knees and swung his arms in an odd manner, more like what an ape would do, and i realized at that point that it could not have been my husband that i saw! the three of us collected ourselves after a couple of minutes and decided to go inside to look in every room in the house but nothing was there. i realized that it was probably not a human being, and chills ran up my spine. my brother needed to go home, and since he had been dropped off after a training meeting at the police department where he is a volunteer, he needed a ride. my daughter took him home and i went along because i did not want to be alone in the house. after dropping my brother off we stopped at my daughter's house to see the work that her husband had finished building a fountain and patio, and i stayed for a while talking with them because i was too afraid to go home yet, then she took me home at about 11:25 p.m. mh husband was not home yet, so i got a big kitchen knife and turned on all of the lights outside the house and on the lower level, locked the doors, then went to the living room to read and wait for him to get back. i did not turn on the t.v. so i would be able to hear any noises. sighting #2: 11:39 p.m. maria had to drop of some important mail at the post ooffice in downtown independence, and when she came out of the doors something caught her eye over a building on the square that was 1\\2 block from the post office in a northerly direction. she said it looked like something the size of a streetlight, a very bright white light, and fell-- free-fall-- from a height of about 60 ft above the building. there was no trail of light behind it. she thought it must have fallen into or just behind the building and was going to go check on it, when she saw a silver truck parked at the side of the building with someone sitting in it. for some reason, she thought that was odd at that hour and decided not to pursue finding the object. note: the building she saw this thing over happens to be right across the street from our two businesses. maria called me and told me about this. we were both incredulous that a second sighting could happen to her on the same night. i told her i was a little concerned that my husband had not yet returned, and it was getting late. a few minutes after we hung up he arrived. when asked why he decided to go to the warehouse so late, and he said he needed to move some stuff around for new stock coming in. i still thought it was strange, though. i told him what had happened and he was amazed and mad that he didn't see it. i was so stressed out that my neck hurt and i told him i wanted to get in the hot tub on the porch but i wanted him to stay downstairs so i wouldn't be alone. he went in the living room and fell asleep on the couch while i got in the tub. i did not feel a presence of anything around, but was still keeping an eye out. maria had suggested that i meditate and and ask what was going on with all of the (extremely) strange stuff that night. i did so, and to my surprise i heard four strange voices talking - it was conversation from an air base and i wrote the entire conversation down right after hearing it! basically, it was about a bogey appearing on radar and they sent a jet up to chase it. note: i am not adding that down here but if anyone is interested i can send it. i don't know what all of the jargon means - i don't have any experience with planes, but i got the impression that this was a real ufo event. sighting #3: now i came out of it and did not hear anything other conversation going on although i felt that was not the end of it. i got out of the hot tub, looked skyward, and saw a bright whitish\\yellow object the size and brightness of mars go from eastto west. it had a trail like a shooting star, however, at this point i wonder what it really was!"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-06282007-0004","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.096836,+-94.410627(7337)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7337) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Circle, Oval","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There were no other sightings in Independence on or around June 20th 2007"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.096836","City":"Independence","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7337.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7337.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/20/2007 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"7337","Longitude":"-94.410627","Region":"Missouri","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/20/2007 12:00 UTC"}
