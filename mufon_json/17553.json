After a while all of the houses were bought out in that area and our house,on the top of the hill,with the police acadamy at the bottom,was later removed.The police acadamy is still there.Its all still there,the Park and the school that I attended near there, in Echo Park.But the BIG QUESTION remains too.Where did the thing I saw go?,and Are there anymore like it out there?"],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00"}
