{"City":"Miami","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Diamond","Case Number":"46977","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was smoking a cigarette when I first noticed the lights. I was looking at the star when I saw two lights that seemed so far away to appear star like but definitely within the atmosphere. I studied the object and determined they were UFO's. They were two glowing lights orange in color. They would move toward each other in a straight line then move apart. They did this continually for the entire time observed. I felt amazed, it seems I somehow always get what I ask for as I have wanted to see a UFO for the longest. I stopped observing the object because I was told by the police to go home as there have been an increase in home robberies by my house."],"Latitude":"25.632686","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"04/23/2013 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.632686,+-80.337113(46977)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46977) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46977.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46977.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Two orange lights would move toward each other then away then back for entire time observed.","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"04/25/2013 12:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 97 other sightings in Miami","There were no other sightings in Miami on or around April 23rd 2013"],"Longitude":"-80.337113","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-04252013-0014"}
