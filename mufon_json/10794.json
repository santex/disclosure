I saw something from the corner of my eye. I looked up and saw a flat, circular object (maybe) that was as bright and white like the moon. It was gliding acrossed the sky, moving pretty fast. It went right through the tree branches, and on the other side of the tree branches, it disappeared. It was large. To big to be a falling star, it had no tail, so it could not of been a comet...Its movement was smooth....and it was flying evenly, accross the sky and it stayed that way until it disappeared. I have never before seen anything like it. It could maybe be considered a disc....Who knows......It was probably the most mysterious thing I have ever seen in my life."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Wilkesboro","There were no other sightings in Wilkesboro on or around May 17th 2008"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10794.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10794.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Wilkesboro","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
