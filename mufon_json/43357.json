I stared at it, marveling over how bright it was in comparison to every other star. After 5 minutes I noticed the light seemed to be getting bigger, very slowly, almost as if the star was moving closer. It did not move about the sky and no flashing occurred. I got a terrible feeling and hid myself behind some tree branches, and then took the dogs in, without looking back. The next night, I was determined to find out what star or planet it was, but alas when I went outside to see it again, it was completely gone. Since then I have researched planets, stars, satellites, and the space station and none fell into the description that I just gave.
