It remained unmoving. It was approx. 5pm so it was dark, though it appeared before any other stars in the sky. I watched it for over 30 mintutes until I noticed a red stream like cloud coming from the sea heading directly towards it. The stream was almost vertical. It moved fairly slowly, but obviously it must have been much faster if the light was very high altitude. It probably took 30 seconds or so for the red stream to reach the light...it came very close but went slightly past it and carried on moving up until I couldn't see it anymore. Anyway, I observed the light as long as I could until cloud coverage prevented me from seeing it anymore. I keep looking out my window, but the clouds are too dense to see anything. I swear to god...something fired at this light in the sky."],"Log Number":"GB-11272008-0013","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"St Helier","Date Submitted":"11/27/2008 05:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
