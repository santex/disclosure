(looking past where the airplanes come and go.) this thing has been in the same general area for hours in the evening, not every night. however, i have seen it 3 times this past week. i go back hours later and do not see it there anymore. (i was sitting in my living room watching tv. you can see it through my sliding glass doors.) airplanes come and go from an airport between me and it. i can see the airplanes very clearly with my binoculars while the orb bobs in place - blinking. it's not an airplane. it could be a satellite or the space station. i don't know. if it was either, why is it usually gone around 9:30-10:30 pm? back in may or june 2008, i saw 5 orbs very similar to it positioned in the sky more to the north then east. (just outside of my house) i ran in to get my cousin; the way they glided into place and then bobbed was fascinating. by the time we got back out, only 3 were still there. one was positioned over some trees and we watched it bob there. i went back later and all 3 were gone. (i had been walking my dogs.) this past week there was this one in almost the same place (a little more to the left and up over the wires). a second more erratic one with very bright\\fast white blinking with intermittent red, green and yellow. i couldn't keep focus on it. sometimes it just disappeared and then reappeared in the same general area to the side of some trees. (i was standing on my porch just outside the sliding glass doors.) i never hear anything. it's all visual. every time i see it i feel intrigue and want to share it with others. i think this is a ufo but wonder why airplanes aren't chasing it and why it keeps popping up in the same general area time and time again. if i had a good camera, i would take pictures. it's far away so a cell phone or regular camera just wouldn't do it justice."],"Log Number":"US-01022009-0021","Tags":"City","Case Number":"14706"}
