(note: i was unable to determine with much certainty it's proximity to my location. taking a mathematical guess, i would say it was about 200-400 feet above ground and between 1-2 miles in distance; but then again, i wouldn't be surprised if somehow i learned that it was, in fact, a meteor well outside the earth's atmosphere - but it was much too bright and had so little movement!) anxious to get someone else's perspective, i rushed into the house to bring another set of eyes onto this magnificent object. it had moved so little during my observation that i figured, surely, i could bring my family out one at a time, if i needed. i first grabbed my mother-in-law, who was just in the kitchen, and rushed her outside! not more than 15 seconds passed while i hurried inside and returned to the front yard. but, sure enough, by the time we emerged from the house, this unbelievable object had inexplicably disappeared."],"Date Submitted":"02/21/2012 03:40 UTC","Longitude":"-75.275676","Date of the Event":"02/20/2012 10:25 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.243185","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35961.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35961.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania"}
