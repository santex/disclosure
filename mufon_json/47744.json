One night I went to our partially set up mobile home to get something I needed for the dinner I was cooking.My husband accompanied me. After I got what I needed and was leaving the house to return to the 5th wheel and a light caught my eye. Up above me to the east was what appeared to be a large window with two beings in it, facing each other as in conversation. The area around it was totally dark. The person or? on the Right was either taller or standing and facing, the one on the left that was either shorter or seated. Just then my husband come out of the mobil with a flash light and it was as though the light was turned off--Gone. I asked my husband to turn off the flashlight. He did, but it was gone. It didn't last longer than say 30 sec. But I know what I saw. Has anything like this been reported before?
