I grabbed the camera and went out on the deck and started taking photos, in the hopes of catching some lighting with my windmill in the photo. The tip of the storm was about two miles south of me. After the stormed had moved off for my perfect shot, I scanned through the photos and found this! I never saw it with my own eyes just caught it in a photo. It was not in any other photos I took that time. Let me know if you know what it is....Thanks!"],"Object Shape":"Disc, Unknown","Log Number":"US-05172010-0009","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
