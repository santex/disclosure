The sky was really clean, without any clouds, suddenly we saw on the horizon a strange white (white cloud colored) object that looked like a cigar and it appeared to be real far away. At the first time we tought it was a cloud, but it ws too fast and clouds doesnt get that shape. Then we tought it was an airplane but it was not leaving any trae or making any noise. I stopped the car, so i could take a picture but it vanished behind the buildings on the horizon which were like 1 kilometers away from that position we were standing. It was descending on a diagonal motion. I got kind of scared at the moment."],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Region":"SÃ£o Paulo","Date of the Event":"05/15/2012 05:20 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-23.555223,+-46.641415(40875)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40875) map </A>","Country":"Brazil","City":"Sao Paulo","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Sao Paulo","There were no other sightings in Sao Paulo on or around May 15th 2012"],"Log Number":"BR-07172012-0007","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-46.641415","Latitude":"-23.555223","Case Number":"40875"}
