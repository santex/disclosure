Disk like, looked as though it was slowly rolling and flipping head over heels. Drifted away until clouds obscured view. Definitely not a bird, plane or helicopter. Had a faint torsion field (for lack of better words) around the object. I was in my backyard looking southeast of Oakhurst, GA. looking up at the beautiful rain clouds when I spotted the object. It caught my eye because it stood out as something obviously anomalous."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40860.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40860.html"],"Case Number":"40860","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc, Other","Summary":"Morphing UFO","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
