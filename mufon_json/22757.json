We saw a large circular white light appear in the distance (guessing 2-3 miles) moving at a high speed from east to west in a straight steady line and then dissapear behind a mountain. We both saw this at the same time and aggreed a about what we saw. It was traveling lower than the mountain tops. This object caught our attention immediately and was with out a doubt a UFO. UFOs' are no surprise to us and we thought it was cool to see one."],"Latitude":"33.402802","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-04112010-0008","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Globe","There were no other sightings in Globe on or around November 30th 2002"]}
