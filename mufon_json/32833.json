I went into my parents' front yard and stood out there for about 20 min. Within 5 minutes I saw an oject moving through the sky. The object has white, yellow and red lights flashing sequentially and flying in a straight pattern in the NE sky. The object appeared to wobble a little moving side to side. It was moving much much faster than any plane I had ever seen at night. I then saw another object do the exact same thing about five minutes later, although this object was moving a little slower. I lost sight of both ojects as they moved through the sky and behind my parents house and were then masked by a hill."],"Log Number":"US-10242011-0016","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/22/2011 09:26 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"37.259157","City":"Vinton","Date Submitted":"10/24/2011 07:13 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Star-like","Summary":"Saw white/red/yellowish lights flashing in a systematic pattern.
