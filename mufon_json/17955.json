They shoot them every year at the local ball stadium (L P Frans) off of Hwy 321. We were parked near the Catawba River bridge at a closed resturant and were facing SW. What we saw was exactly like what I have read that so many others around the country saw that night. I have seen other UFO's as well, but these were obviously huge or traveled everywhere according to all the reports. They were scheduled to have the fireworks at 10 o'clock.. we saw two objects approx. 15-20 minutes before they started. One appeared out of nowhere.. almost looked as though it rose straight up out of the horizon, then it traveled toward us horozontaly then reversed itself into the opposite direction as it continued to rise again. Then it seemed to disappear out of sight. There were two of these objects. The second appeared approx. 10 minutes after the first one was gone. My husband, who is a non believer, made a joke about how someone in Hickory would report UFO's. These were not large balloons, as he had first suggested. The appearence of the fire did not go out as he had claimed it would after they rose. There is no way they were balloons. These objects were bright, orange & dark orange, round and appeared to flicker like they were on fire. The height is difficult for me when they leveled out, but was around cloud level.. These two objects were not helicopters, airplanes, satilites, balloons or like anything else I have ever seen... It has impressed me that so many people saw them over such a huge area.. seems to me like most of the US... What were they?.."],"Object Shape":"Circle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17955.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17955.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.742418,+-81.333767(17955)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17955) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.333767","Summary":"Orange floating firey type objects"}
