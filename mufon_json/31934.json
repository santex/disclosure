It took about 2 minutes for these objects to move from 0 to 40 degrees across my FOV where they either completely disappeared or where hidden by cloud cover. It was at this point when I noticed a large egg or teardrop shaped object appearing to moved slowly towards and float above my neighbor's house. It was at this point when I left in my vehicle, but the object still seemed to be floating in the area when I left. I would describe the objects as similar in color to fire or electrical sparks. The third object appeared to be made of plasma or some sort of non-solid substance.I was scared enough during and after that I wasn't in the right mind to record the event, even though I had a camera with me."],"Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Circle, Egg, Fireball, Sphere, Teardrop","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31934.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31934.html"],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"42.134843","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.134843,+-72.742558(31934)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31934) map </A>","Case Number":"31934","Region":"Massachusetts","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Westfield","There were no other sightings in Westfield on or around September 16th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-09192011-0033","City":"Westfield"}
