As I put the trash down, I glanced up and noticed this boomerang shaped object (almost like a winged shape) gliding quietly along and was oddly glowing (a very light blue hue). I looked down for a second until I grasped what I saw. I just stood there thinking how I needed a camera. It was cruising along at a very slow pace, maybe 100-200 MPH. Not fast at all. When it went behind a cluster of trees about 5 seconds later, I tried to run to the other street, but it was gone. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this. I've always been skeptical, but this has definitely changed my mind. Don't be surprised if I keep my head looking towards the heavens more often."],"Case Number":"22314","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-83.619127","Date of the Event":"03/15/2010 11:10 UTC"}
