If you put your pinkie up to the sky that is about the distance apart from each other. I first notice them by just looking up and saw them when they were almost over my head. I thought they were UFO's, satilites are usually more apart from each other and side by side or close to that, plus they were moving to slow. The objects were small and were very high and look oval and dark gray. At first they were moving North East at a slow pace and then they made a slow turn to the East. Not much on these because they were so high I didn't think they could see my flaslight and also they didn't have any lights on or running lights either one. It just went out of sight. I looked at my phone to see what time it was and it was 9:46pm Pacific time, but I didn't look intill about 10 minutes after they were gone approxmently."],"Object Shape":"Oval","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"50742","City":"Turlock","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-120.841994","Object Features":"Unknown"}
