I interrupted our conversation to have my two friends watch as well. We all agreed it did not look like a plane. It had no red or flashing lights and moved much faster than an airplane as it moved from the northwest toward the southeast over us. It basically traveled straight that direction but was making sudden slight shifts in trajectory that seemed to agile for standard aircraft. We all watched in amazement and walked out into the yard to keep an eye on it as it went behind the trees on the back edge of my property and eventually dipped under the horizon. My phone was inside and the only one of us who had one failed to get video before it was gone."],"Country":"United States"}
