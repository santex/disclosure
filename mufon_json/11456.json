I was jumping on my trampoline and my friend Nate noticed the object. It appeared to be a hot air balloon. After I zoomed in on my camera it appeared to be something I've never saw before.. unfortunately I was unable to get a picture of the UFO because the camera's batteries died on me. When we saw it we were so scared and when it went behind the trees by my house it disappeared..........................Around an hour later it came back out and there were the towns fireworks and when they started it dissapeared behind the coal mountain.
