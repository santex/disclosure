After making a drop I spotted what looked like an unusually bright star to the east. Since I was traveling homeward, in an easterly direction, the object stayed within my view for half and hour. I noticed that it was slowly going down on the horizon. This in my mind precluded it having a natural explanation. Because of its slow movement I felt this wasn't an aircraft. I also noted that this \"aircraft\" didn't have any hazard warning lights associated with manmade aircraft. Upon my arrival at my home I took out my field glasses and that is when I noted its oval shape."]}
