(we moved away from north dakota in 2011.) i was telling our computer guy about the ufo photo and showed it to him, and he showed me how to enlarge the view of the photo on screen -- at which point i noticed for the first time ever looking at the photo that there seemed to be a second object further in the distance than the very obvious large one closest to us. as best we could tell, the second, more distant object or craft looked in general shape and (somewhat fuzzy) detail still looked very much in general shape\\outline to resemble\\mimic the more easily apparent appearance of the large object closest to us. most of the questions you have asked about i cannot answer becasue neither my husband or i saw the craft(s) or object(s) in the sky at the time the photo of them was taken. it actually seems very weird to us that we did not see the closer object because we were looking in its direction and it is really pretty large looking \\close -looking. i can tell you that there were no kids out in the field behind us flying box kites.. and that none of the power poles distantly visible, nor objects or buildings in surrounding neighbor yards had things attached or attachable to them that could explain what we can see as a somewhat blurry, but really definite and large object looming quite close to where we were but (maybe??) 500+ ft above in the sky! the second , more distant but similar looking object is even harder to guess dimensions and elevation of than the near object... but as big as the near object looks it actually spooks me out that we did not see it at all until we got the film back.. what finally triggered me to send you the photo and this (likely rather unhelpful) 'sighting' report is that it really blew me away when i realized there was seemingly a second one of these odd objects in the distance! somehow that seemed even weirder than the fact of seeing the (equally inexplicable) closer object shown in the photo--! not sure why, but the thought that there were two of these things hovering or passing above made me think finally that this was all just too odd not to file a report , even though so many details are unknown (since we did not 'register' seeing the object(s) in real time. which is strange in and of itself given the size of the object closest to us! at any rate- there you have it !!"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"46.543297","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48444.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48444.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-102.871138","Date Submitted":"06/26/2013 11:58 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"48444","Region":"North Dakota","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s), Other, Unknown"}
