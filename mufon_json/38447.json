Plane fly around here all the time, but not that low to make that kind of sound. I was in my room, upstairs and it sounded like it was flying over the house. I went to the window and looked out, all i could see was this little white light in the distance. It blinked in a line, what looked to be three lights going across, all three white. It was really far in the distance by the time I got the picture, but the sound carried on for about 6 minutes."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/22/2012 11:30 UTC","Summary":"very loud rumbling noise, white light.","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"38447","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
