{"divs":["sighting detailsfirst picture...march 2007, i was on a weekend vacation in las vegas. woke up early in the morning so i could take pictures from the hotel window of the sunrise. i was not quiet happy with the quality of the pictures, so i never really looked at them. they were taken through glass from the 17th floor of the hotel. towards the end of the year (2007) i happened to go through the pictures and noticed something���.the lights in ���one��� of the pictures. the reason i never looked at these was the quality of the pictures���1. i had to find a clean spot in the windows to take the picture. 2. had my lens flush against the glass (no flash or tripod used) 3. they were slightly blurry. i have tried to eliminate all possibilities of the lights, but cannot. second picture...3\\25\\2006 - my husband was out taking pictures of the sunset, learning how to use his new camera. although we live at the north end of the flight path and have birds flying over, he timed his pictures so neither would be in the frames. he took 2 pictures back to back. while going through the pictures, this one was almost discarded as a flop. when i increased the size of the picture to see what these were, i can say that it isn't a plane or birds. with closer examination, i noticed that the dash on the right is above the vapor trail."],"Summary":"Amazing what you find in pictures after the event","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-02182008-0015","Longitude":"-119.772415","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9635.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9635_submitter_file1__100_4089ufo.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9635_submitter_file2__IMG_1899Guys.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9635.html"],"Latitude":"39.493056","Case Number":"9635","Region":"Nevada","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/28/2006 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 65 other sightings in Reno","There were no other sightings in Reno on or around February 28th 2006","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Reno","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"02/28/2006 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.493056,+-119.772415(9635)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9635) map </A>"}
