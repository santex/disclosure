It was traveling parrelell to the road in front of my house. As it came closer I could tell that it was made up of 6 or 8 red lights that made the shape of either a hexagon or an octagon. When it got strait above me it seemed to have launched a single red lighted object at a 90 degree angle to the main object. The main object continued due west and the other to the south. I watched both objects continue untill thay faded out of sight Please let me know if there has ever been a report like this one Thank you Ray Williams"],"trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Jackson","There were no other sightings in Jackson on or around July 15th 1982"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-84.392176","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.249449,+-84.392176(13957)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13957) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.249449","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13957.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13957.html"],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Octagon shape made up of red lights that launched another red object at a 90 degree angle.","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"07/15/1982 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"13957","City":"Jackson","Log Number":"US-11242008-0037"}
