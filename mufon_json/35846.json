{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI walked out of my house on the way out to work when I noticed the lights on the general direction of Homestead air Force base. They were moving on different directions in a zig zag motion... really weird, definitely not an aircraft. Took a picture with my Iphone and ran inside the house to get a real camera, by the time I came back they were already gone... time elapsed was aprox. 30 secs."],"trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Homestead","There was one other sighting in Homestead on or around February 16th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.475922,+-80.473997(35846)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (35846) map </A>","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Case Number":"35846","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Homestead","Date Submitted":"02/16/2012 11:17 UTC","Summary":"Glowing Light","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Latitude":"25.475922","Sighting Duration":"00:01:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/35846.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/35846_submitter_file1__photo.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/35846.html"],"Log Number":"US-02162012-0007","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/16/2012 06:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-80.473997"}
