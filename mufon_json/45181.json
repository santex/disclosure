The first shot with the horse was in the direction of the ocean. We made a U-turn as we passed the horse and the second photo of the birds was west of the horse. This picture was taken less than a minute after the first photo. I didn't see the odd shape above the horse until I auto-enhanced the photo in Photoshop. The second photo may be the original image."],"Date Submitted":"01/13/2013 03:57 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.343503"}
