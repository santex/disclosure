I was standing in my backyard of the house I grew up in and was 19. The two year electronics course didn't start a new class until the Fall of 66. Out of the corner of my left eye I saw a group of lights. I turned to look at them and they were headed North towards me from the South. One was a little faster and stopped overhead then the others stopped with it. I am not sure how long they stopped as I just stood there with my mouth hanging open. I had a Polaroid Land Camera with 3000 speed film in my hands and never thought to use it. They then continued North and about 45 degrees above the horizon they curved up towards space. I read about ufos but never thought I would see any. they were a dime at arm's length. I reported it to NICAP but said a nickel which was a little too big. They appeared solid and no stars were visible through them. I also reported to the Clinton Herald Newspapewr in hopes it would bring out other witnesses but no go."],"Date Submitted":"04/30/1966 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9910.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9910.html"],"Country":"United States"}
