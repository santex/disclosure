I noticed the northern lights through our back window, and leaned back to watch them. While my grandmother drove, she looked out the front window to try and see them, suddenly she said, \"Arie, do you see that?\" I looked up and saw a red, blinking light that was swirling around in circles.. probably about 500 feet up, at first i thought it was a plane or a satalite, but it was moving WAY to fast. the minute we noticed it, it seemed to speed up and rose up in the sky to a higher altitude, then it sped away at an amazing speed. I was amazed, we both were, we stopped the car while it was still in the sky, and i tried to get a picture of it. which failed."],"Date Submitted":"04/25/2010 10:39 UTC","Summary":"A bright red light, that swirled through the sky at an amazing speed","Country":"Canada","Case Number":"22967"}
