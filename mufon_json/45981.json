{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsEric was driving a production truck eastbound on I-84 to a commercial shoot. Noticed waterfalls ahead and stretched his arm toward the open passenger window to get a shot. This picture was taken before Exit 30 on I-84 at the waterfall above Wahkeena Rearing Lake. Put the camera away until later that day at the hotel, noticed the object and what looks like a vapor trail behind it while looking through the pics on the camera. The card remained in the camera until February 3, 2011. Downloaded it to the laptop and stared at it until now. The idea was to take a picture of a waterfall, not of something odd in the sky. This, whatever this is, is what was on that frame."],"Date Submitted":"03/01/2013 05:54 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.543796,+-122.383813(45981)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45981) map </A>","Log Number":"US-03012013-0006","Case Number":"45981","City":"Troutdale","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Troutdale","There were no other sightings in Troutdale on or around November 1st 2010","This sighting has been favorited 2 times.",""],"Region":"Oregon","Date of the Event":"11/01/2010 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Taking waterfall pics while driving and this is what was caught.","Object Features":"Dome, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Longitude":"-122.383813","Object Shape":"Egg","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45981.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45981_submitter_file1__DSCN0004copy.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45981_submitter_file2__NearBensonStateRecOregonUFO.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45981_submitter_file3__FotoForensic.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45981_submitter_file4__Exit30BensonStateRec.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/45981_submitter_file5__Exit30BensonStateRec1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45981.html"],"Latitude":"45.543796","Country":"United States"}
