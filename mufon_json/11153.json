I noticed only one bright 'star' in the NW sky. The sun had already set but the sky was still light so no other stars were visible...only the moon. I got my Orion binoculars and looked at the 'star' and noticed that it was an oval bright white with light greenish and pinkish colors. The oval was in a vertical position. My husband and I looked at it for about 10 minutes and decided it must be a planet. I was going to go inside and look on the internet to see if I could find out what it was. Then my husband and I noticed, (with our naked eyes), that it started fading. I looked through the binoculars again and could see that it was sparking or sparkling like fireworks do when they are falling. It seemed to drop slightly and then slowly faded out. There was no sound and not a cloud in the sky."],"Longitude":"-81.704314","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.169554,+-81.704314(11153)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11153) map </A>","Date Submitted":"06/13/2008 08:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/13/2008 08:45 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
