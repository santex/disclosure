As she was letting in the dog, she looked up and said \"Look Papa\" as she pointed above. I didn't see anything initially, stepped outside and looked around the house and sure enough, saw three round, orange lights moving at a very high rate of speed from east to west. There was no doubt, this was NOT an airplane or helicopter. There was no sound to it and the speed really stood out. They moved so fast and then faded away. I was absolutely STUNNED when I saw this, and to know I wasn't the ONLY one seeing it, as my granddaughter was the one who drew my attention to it. This was definitely not like anything I have EVER seen before in my life! I've attached a drawing our 8 yr old granddaughter drew of what she saw, then a drawing of what I saw."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
