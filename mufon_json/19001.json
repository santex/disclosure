{"Country":"Australia","divs":["Sighting DetailsPre dawn on the 8th of July 2009, I checked the sky at 6.45am - Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. There were no clouds but there was a very light haze and a light breeze. The Sun was below my horizon and dawn was close. I could easily see 1st magnitude stars and Jupiter and Venus were equally bright in the Northern sky. Equidistant between them, almost as bright and the same colour, was what I initially assumed to be Saturn on the ecliptic. As I watched, ���Saturn��� disappeared - like a light being switched off. I checked afterwards with binoculars and there was no sign of anything in the vicinity. What I saw wasn���t moving and there was no noise. There was no sign of aircraft navigation lights. What I saw looked exactly like a planet i.e. not twinkling like a star. The only satellite bright enough would have been the ISS, but I checked and it was over Russia at the time. I checked my SkyMap software and there was nothing astronomical and bright enough in that position. Saturn wasn���t currently visible in the Australian sky. I can���t see it being a weather balloon or a satellite because apart from it being stationary, it was high (about 60 degrees) in the sky and the sun was rising, not setting so it wouldn���t have blinked out. I���m well aware of the behavior satellites (normal and Iridium), Chinese lanterns, weather balloons and aircraft lights; I���m positive it wasn���t any of these. This is not a spectacular sighting, but I���ve been an amateur astronomer for over 50 years and it���s got me stumped."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Latitude":"-37.808887","Log Number":"AU-09012009-0005","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"144.96624","Summary":"Like something astronomical blinking off","Date Submitted":"09/01/2009 11:02 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19001.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19001.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","City":"Melbourne","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"19001","trends":["There have been 40 other sightings in Melbourne","There were no other sightings in Melbourne on or around July 8th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-37.808887,+144.96624(19001)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19001) map </A>","Region":"Victoria","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/08/2009 06:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
