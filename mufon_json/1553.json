The sound lasted for 20 -30 secondsthen faded. After that I thought I heard an airplane. A minute or two later Igot up to go to my living area which has four glass sliders on the west side. Isaw a very bright light in the west which seemed to be hovering over the northend of Yarmouth island. I kept staring at it wondering what it could be. I triedto look at it through my binoculars, but the stabilizer needed new batteries. Icouldnt hold it steady so it made the lights dance. The light was very brightand after a few seconds appeared to be rising above the trees. I thought it wascoming closer and decided to wake my husband. He arrived just in time to get aglimpse before it disappeared lowering the sky and going behind the trees on theisland. After that it was gone."],"Object Shape":"Oval","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"New York","Region":"New York","Case Number":"1553","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.722613,+-73.999113(1553)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1553) map </A>","Summary":"I sighted a very bright colorful object in the wes","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around February 1st 2002"]}
