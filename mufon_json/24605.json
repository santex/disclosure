She saw the incident too. I saw a fireball fall from the clouds (it was overcast). Ar first I thought it was a meteor. Then the fireball split into four then disappeared. A few seconds later, all 4 reappeared above the plane where they had vanished. They hovered for a few minutes moving back and forth from left to right and back again. They appeared to be about 5 miles away but no more than ten. They glowed yellow like a flame the whole time then disappeared behind the clouds again. I've never seen a plane act this way and never seen one glow like a fire."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/17/2010 10:54 UTC","Region":"Ohio","Log Number":"US-07172010-0029","Country":"United States","Case Number":"24605","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-84.357243","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around July 17th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24605.html"],"Summary":"Fireball like burning satellite.
