{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside with my family by the fire when i went into the house to let the dog outside to join us. It was getting late, anywhere between 11-12, when from the back porch I saw a steady, white star-like object pass slowly for about 30 seconds until it finally dimmed slowly until it went out. It was high up and only just as large as one of the stars. I don't know what I thought at first because the object was moving to slow to be a shooting star, and too fast to be a transiting planet. The object moved in a straight path, and seemed to be extremely high up."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"29309","Log Number":"US-05302011-0005","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29309.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29309.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/28/0001 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Atlantic City","There were no other sightings in Atlantic City on or around May 26th 0001"],"City":"Atlantic City","Region":"New Jersey","Date Submitted":"05/30/2011 05:10 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.366393,+-74.416827(29309)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29309) map </A>","Latitude":"39.366393","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-74.416827","Summary":"Tiny Star like object","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle"}
