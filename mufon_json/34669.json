{"Summary":"Three objects hovered, maintained level flight, came straight for us hovered, formed EQL Triangle flew in fomation back to starting point, hovered then faded into nothing.","divs":["Sighting DetailsThe siting I had, and got pictures of, was witnessed by about 8-12 people along the trail head. The others who witnessed this after I pointed the objects out to every one around me thought that the three objects were parasailors, clear out in the distance. After they got in closer, we could all see that by the way that they maneuvered, that they obviously weren���t parasailors. I stopped because there has been a lot of military flight activity from camp Williams since October and the flight path is the same one these were taking to Hill. I talked with the FAA in October and they confirmed \"There has been a lot of activity out of camp Williams to Hill, and I (Bonnie-FAA) know for a fact there are more military helos than usual because they land very close to my office and keep them running the whole time before they lift off again. The fumes make it hard for me (Bonnie-FAA) to breath sometimes\". So, in all reality, at first I thought they were military birds and since I was right there and had a camera, I thought I would get some good shots of some choppers. They weren���t choppers or parasailors either. I don't want an investigation, I just want to make a report and submit evidence to let the public know that our airspace is being violated. Since this is a UFO related site for Utah, I thought I would give this site a try."],"Date Submitted":"01/06/2012 03:55 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Square, Rectagular, Unknown","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Salt Lake City","There were no other sightings in Salt Lake City on or around January 1st 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"40.675397","Longitude":"-111.807172","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34669.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34669_submitter_file1__DSC_0472.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34669_submitter_file2__DSC_0472-Copy.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/34669_submitter_file3__DSC_0476.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34669.html"],"Date of the Event":"01/01/2012 05:31 UTC","Object Features":"Appendage(s), Other, Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Salt Lake City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"34669","Log Number":"US-01062012-0019","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.675397,+-111.807172(34669)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34669) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Utah"}
