It didn't descend down sharp enough that it seemed to just be falling like a star, but it also descended too quick for a normal plane. I think the fact that it was so bright green and glowing that puzzled me the most. I never saw anything quite like it. I don't think meteorites glow green do they? It went down toward Centenary Road where it goes into Brooklyn. I was in Brooklyn at the time I saw it."],"Case Number":"47750","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/30/2013 11:10 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Bright large glowing green object that decended quicky from right to left and downward","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Brooklyn","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47750.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47750.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/30/2013 11:33 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"39.539214"}
