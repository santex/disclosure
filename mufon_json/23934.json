Seemed they were in big hurry this time . To the question #2 & #5 , I was expecting to see them as I had no reason to go to look out the window & actually was about to leave home , I always feel happy to see them . Someone wrote a report re: a dream of the ETs , don't worry , that is one way how they communicate , good that you have a clear mind & heart . And yes they do at times have some difficulty manouver the ships in our atmosphere . A year ago I too had a simmilar dream & in it they travelled in front of my building towards Eastern direction & about an hour later after awaking it was in the news UFO crashed in the Ottawa river."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.654386,+-79.379664(23934)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23934) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON"}
