{"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"11483","Latitude":"25.5783","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 7pm I went outside with my canon 7mp powershot sd550, to my backyard to take pictures of the clouds after a storm, during sunset. Later as I was checking my pictures I noticed two objects hovering at a distance I'm not sure of. When I downloaded the picture to my computer is when I realized I took a picture of a UFO. I went outside again to see the area of the picture I took but I saw nothing. I think I didn't see the objects when I was taking pictures because at the time I was not wearing my glasses."],"Date Submitted":"07/06/2008 07:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Cutler Bay","There were no other sightings in Cutler Bay on or around July 6th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11483.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11483_submitter_file1__IMG_0081.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11483_submitter_file2__IMG_0092.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11483.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/06/2008 07:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=25.5783,+-80.3377(11483)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11483) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"I was outside taking pictures of the clouds, after a storm, during sunset.","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.3377","City":"Cutler Bay","Tags":"City","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"US-07082008-0010","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
