Originally reported to UFOCasebook.com: I was awakened this morning about 5:40 am here in west Houston by my 17 year old daughter who was up early for school. She was sitting eating breakfast and happened to notice a strange light out the back window. She said she watched it, got her sister (15), and witnessed three distinct groups of lights hovering over the rooftops in the distance. They said they could see a dark object in the center of one, but two were just hovering as changing colored lights (at different heights). That's when they woke me. I ran outside to see and confirmed two of these objects. At an arm's length I'd say they were about the size of an aspirin or peanut. Fairly large and distinct with 4 or 5 lights making up a cross or diamond shape. The lights were pulsating and changing colors: red, green, blue, white, turquoise. I went in to get my astronomical telescope to see if I could zero in on it. While I was trying to sight it, the one I was watching reduced size, turned orange and began to move to my right. I followed it around to the front of my house and watched it slowly move parallel to the ground just above the rooftops until it disappeared behind some homes. The other light was gone when I looked back. My daughter tried to film it, but could not get it focused. However, you can see the two objects and the colors that they were cycling through. We have been watching news and Internet but have seen no other reports, except in researching, I came across a description of a sighting the same day, 12 hours later in British Columbia. We don't know, of course, what it was, but the two objects I saw were silent. About twenty minutes later, I went back outside and saw an aircraft approaching from a different part of the horizon and could clearly hear that it was a helicopter. So I use that in contrast to the silence of the first sighting. Update-03-09-08-The gentleman who took the video below has sent additional information about the video: Anyway, the two lower lights are normal. The white light is a porch light on someone���s home a few hundred yards away and the yellow light is a street lamp. The two upper, out of focus, but changing color, orbs are the sightings. Again, these were each made up of several lights in a kind of x pattern. We could clearly see them but when she was filming she didn���t realize that the leaves of a palm were throwing off the focus of the camera. We are kicking ourselves we didn���t take more shots outside. In the moment we were mesmerized and didn���t want to take our eyes off them. They were incredible! And I know that there is lots of air traffic in this area, but I���ve never ever seen anything like these lights before..."],"Date Submitted":"03/05/2008 05:40 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12170.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12170.html"],"Object Shape":"Cross, Diamond","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"None","Summary":"2 groups of 5 lights each, rapidly changing colors","Date of the Event":"03/05/2008 05:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.767163,+-95.3629(12170)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12170) map </A>","City":"Houston","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-95.3629","Latitude":"29.767163"}
