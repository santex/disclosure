I have seen several things in the skys over ny house many times. I was looking at 2 airplanes going by and I noticed a bright light coming from the south. I would have gone right over my house but it made a course correction behind the trees which I did not see, but when I saw it again it was traveling NE instead of due N. It was bigger than a star or what a satellite would be, and I watched it for 2 minutes before going out of site. I immediately went in and got on the NASA site and looked to see if the ISS was going over than or another satellite, neither the ISS of any satellite at the time was going over my house, and since when does a satellite change direction? There are a few more stories about what I have seen over loveland ohio and else where in my travels. Was very High up in space, but it was bright and big."],"Log Number":"US-08052011-0094","Object Shape":"Sphere","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.240223","Date Submitted":"08/05/2011 09:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30445.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30445.html"],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Loveland-Madeira Corridor","There were no other sightings in Loveland-Madeira Corridor on or around July 27th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"30445","Country":"United States","Summary":"Bright Light bigger than a star or satellite","Sighting Duration":"00:02:25","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.240223,+-84.280262(30445)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30445) map </A>","Source":"MUFON"}
