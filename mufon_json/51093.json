I noticed an object slowly gliding silently from the east to the north west. It caught my eye because of the shape which seamed to be sort of a square shape which I could make out due to the light pattern on the bottom. I watched this object for about five minutes before it vanished beyond the tree line to the north west of here. The flashing lights on the bottom weren't very bright and all seemed to flash at random unlike most air craft I see fly over this area."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Tags":"City","Latitude":"42.838642","Log Number":"US-09262013-0003","Summary":"Silent square shaped object slowly gliding off to the NW","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"09/26/2013 02:30 UTC"}
