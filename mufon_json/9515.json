Initially, I thought it might be a balloon. However, it just was hanging there. I ran in my apartment and got my video camera and filmed it. I had a hard time focusing on it or finding it with my camera due to it being so bright -- very hard to see the LCD screen in the day light. Finally I lost track of the craft as it moved through the clouds."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
