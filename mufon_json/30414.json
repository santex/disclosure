My wife said ; \" hun what are those \" ? I looked up and saw a line of what looked like what to be a group of four objects flying in group formation heading east to west . They where bell shaped with an red orange light that swirled around the bottom . It seemed odd to me because I'm an avid aircraft fan , I havent ever seen anything like it . But then there came another , and another ,and another . There were about 15-20 , approx. 4 - 8 miles in the sky...they were moving what seemed to be too slow for an object that didnt have any wings to sustain flight ! When they passed over us it was even stranger because there were no rear thrusters and when it passed their was no light just the dark objects they continued their path and then were gone one by one as if they were playing follow the leader. I was still in awe when i realized that they didn't disappear from the horizon that were just gone... I was excited , I was frightened , And I was very very curious. I called selfridge air national guard base, Michigan , I asked the public liason , person if there was an air show or if they had anything as far as manouvers that day because of the fourth...he said there wasn't...I still have questions !"],"Longitude":"-83.332619","Disposition":"IFO","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/06/2011 12:41 UTC"}
