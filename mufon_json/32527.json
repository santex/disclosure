{"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details- I AND 3 OTHERS OBSERVED A UFO DESCENDING NORTHWEST INTO THE FOREST. IT WAS FOGGY BUT WE SAW IT CLEARLY. IT WAS LARGE, DARK, WITH AT LEAST 2 RED LIGHTS. NO SPOT LIGHTS OR GREEN STATIONARY LIGHT LIKE NORMAL AIRCRAFT. WE WERE IN PINE BUSH ON ONE OF OUR PRIME SIGHTING LOCATIONS BUT WE IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THIS BECAUSE OF HOW LOW IT WAS. IT HAPPENED WITHIN A 1 MINUTE PERIOD -- THE OBJECT WAS MOVING FAST AND THROUGH THE BINOCULORS I LOST SIGHT OF IT AS IT DESCENDED AND APPEARED TO LAND SOMEWHERE TO THE NORTHWEST OF OUR VIEWPOINT."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-73.91433","Summary":"AWESOME SIGHTING OF BLACK UFO LANDING IN WOODS OF PINE BUSH","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Poughkeepsie","There were no other sightings in Poughkeepsie on or around October 10th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Fog","Date Submitted":"10/11/2011 10:13 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.701541,+-73.91433(32527)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32527) map </A>","Log Number":"US-10112011-0005","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32527.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32527.html"],"Region":"New York","City":"Poughkeepsie","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"10/10/2011 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"32527","Latitude":"41.701541","Source":"MUFON"}
