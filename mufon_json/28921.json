It was around 8:40ish while I was watching the SJ Sharks Hockey game in my garage. I looked over my roof line and towards Morgan Hill area were about 8 glowing orageish balls. This was 8:40ish pm and at first I thought they were flares but they were moving erratically. At first staying still then moving rapidly. This was Cambrian area facing Morgan Hill. I saw them for several minutes. I googled the sighting and it looked very similar to other sightings shown; multiple round objects moving unnaturally. I am not saying they are not from this world but it was highly unnatural."],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/29/2011 08:40 UTC","City":"San Jose","Latitude":"37.341496","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28921.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28921.html"],"Summary":"multiple orange circle formation over san jose ca","Case Number":"28921"}
