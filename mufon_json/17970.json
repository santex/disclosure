{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"7 white/silver things on the 4th of July Huntington Beach California","divs":["sighting detailswe saw 7 white\\silver things on the 4th of july at 3:50 pm, in clear sunny southern california skies, while swimming in the pool. i spotted 3 white\\silver shiny objects first. i observed them for a minute or so, and thought that they were just balloons. then i noticed that they were not floating up or drifting like a balloon would. the 3 objects were staying the same distance from each other and not being blown around by the wind. they moved back and forth for 20 seconds or so against the wind and sometimes would stay in the same spot for a few moments. i���m guessing they were 3000 or more feet up. i showed the family what i was looking up at and they watched them too. my son pointed out that there were 4 more white\\silver objects over there in the east. all 7 of the things stayed the same distance from each other while we all watched them for about fifteen minutes. my wife said that they were probably just balloons. my son said that they were definitely not balloons, he pointed out how they were not moving with the wind, and they were staying in the same formation from each other and the surface did not look like balloons. they looked kind of like bright stars in the daytime. when i first spotted them they would have been over the seal beach weapons station. all 7 of them eventually moved west towards the 405 freeway and golden west street and disappeared from our view."],"Case Number":"17970","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17970.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17970.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/04/2009 03:50 UTC","Latitude":"33.666667","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"07/04/2009 03:50 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","trends":["There have been 49 other sightings in Huntington Beach","There were no other sightings in Huntington Beach on or around July 4th 2009"],"Tags":"City","Longitude":"-117.991426","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Light","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","City":"Huntington Beach","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.666667,+-117.991426(17970)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17970) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:50:00","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Log Number":"US-07092009-0006","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
