It was dark, and a bit cold. We were outside and we heard this noise, this \"loooooooo\" sound. We looked up and there were a couple of lights in the sky, blue green and purple lights. They were changing color and wiggling a bit. After a minute or two, all of the sudden the craft? came down really fast. Without any noise or wind, the lights just got much further apart and much bigger. Then suddenly, it flew off to the right, really fast."],"Case Number":"3403","Date of the Event":"03/20/2005 02:51 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Norcross","There were no other sightings in Norcross on or around March 20th 2005"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.945393,+-84.203881(3403)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3403) map </A>","Disposition":"Hoax","Date Submitted":"03/20/2005 02:51 UTC","Longitude":"-84.203881","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3403.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3403.html"],"Tags":"City"}
