I feel I have something important to share with you. I used to be a doubter of these U.F.O. s of science fiction, but that is no longer true. At about 7:31 today, I saw an amazing thing in the sky. I saw some sort of craft, with four lights. It had four lights. One light was blue, the other yellow. The other two lights seem to be blinking multiple colors. The craft was flying northeast at great speed. It took less than five seconds for it to go from one side of the horizen to the other. It made a hi-pitched sound as it went across the sky. Something that sounded like \"looooooooooo\". This was definitely no airplane like I have ever seen. Thank you Anne Lopez"],"Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","City":"Mesa","Date Submitted":"03/20/2005 02:49 UTC","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Mesa","There were no other sightings in Mesa on or around March 20th 2005"],"Longitude":"-111.826322","Region":"Arizona","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3424.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3424.html"]}
