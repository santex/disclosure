{"divs":["Sighting DetailsStanding on my back porch I have a view of 9 radio antennas. Between two of the antennas which are about 2 miles in the distance and above them I noticed a single blink of white light about 1 second in duration. At first I thought this was an airplane, but there were no other blinks. So I watched that area. Then about 1-2 minute later there was a second blink same duration close to the first one. I waited another few minutes to see if there were anymore, but that was it and I was impatient and went back inside. It was a cloudless clear night. Other planes could be seen in the sky with blinking lights as usual. The angle from the horizon was about 10-15 degrees. The antennas themselves have an array of blinking lights, and blink about every 3 seconds. I could distinctly see the antenna blinks, and the two blinks I saw were not part of the antenna arrays."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02242007-0008","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.908277,+-82.256712(6454)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6454) map </A>","Region":"Florida","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"6454","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6454.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6454.html"],"City":"Lithia/Riverview","Summary":"Two soft white 1 second flashes of light","Date Submitted":"02/22/2007 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash","Latitude":"27.908277","trends":["there have been no other sightings in lithia\\riverview","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-82.256712","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/22/2007 07:30 UTC"}
