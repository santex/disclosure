At first I thought it was a satellite because it was moving the same speed as one and the same shape and size also, but then i saw it wasn't one because i saw a smaller red light travelling behind it. It was moving around 2x as faster than the first object which was infront of the red light, it lasted about 6 seconds as i was watching the red light coming more closer to the white object. Then, the red object looked like it was ''sucked'' into the white light. After that the white object was moving for a few more seconds than faded out and vanished."],"Date Submitted":"07/17/2010 04:48 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"AU-07172010-0007","Case Number":"24582","Latitude":"-27.461053","City":"Brisbane","Object Shape":"Star-like","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"153.026402","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Country":"Australia"}
