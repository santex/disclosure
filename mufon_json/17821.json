I have never seen anything that quite resembled it so I told the others to look at it. We watched it and noticed it flashed in sequences of 2 2 2 2 2 then 1 1 1 1 1 and kept repeating this pattern. It looked to be over the Larchmont NY area. It moved slowly to the East then back to the West. It did this a few times and at times seemed to be stationary. Then it moved slowly to the west until it was out of view. We watched it for about 10 minutes. We couldn't tell the size and shape because it was dark outside. In between the flashings of the red light, which was fairly constant, I could make out a dim white light on the craft."],"Latitude":"40.927877","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07052009-0026","Summary":"Hovering flashing red light approximately over Larchmont, NY.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17821.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17821.html"],"Longitude":"-73.751798","City":"Larchmont","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
