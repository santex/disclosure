It had a tail like a shooting star ar it could have been burning green behind it. The whole thing happened pretty fast. I saw three other cars stop and look. They looked as confused as me. I have never seen anything like this before. I know airplanes arent green with tails. I dont know if it was a meteor or not, never seen one. I would love to know what it was though."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City"}
