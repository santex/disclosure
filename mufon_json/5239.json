I just made a small note on my patrol log and did not tell any one about it. About three months later my department posted a phone number to call if we saw any ufos. another time i was down in the Nocona air port its in a valley very low, i was out side my patrol vehicle, I saw a bright light very high in the sky it went horison to horison in about 60 sec.
