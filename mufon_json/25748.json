{"Case Number":"25748","divs":["sighting detailsdad passed away this summer, not long after his 89th birthday. i wish i'd asked him to write down the details, but unfortunately i didn't, and now it's too late. i'm not sure why i'm doing this now, but the story has always stayed with me, and i have to wonder if others recall this event. here's what i am able to remember: in early 1961, my father was driving alone after sunset in southern new hampshire. i think he said it was in february (or april?), near dover, maybe around 8:00. he said that he, as well as several other people on the road, witnessed a cigar-shaped craft flying low, with multicolored blinking lights. it hovered over the road and then quickly moved off and disappeared. my father was a levelheaded, intelligent, analytical person. he only brought it up once or twice in the 1970's\\1980's, in a matter-of-fact manner. i have no reason to doubt his story. he had no idea what it was; he didn't speculate. i personally have never seen a ufo, nor do i know anyone else who has, but dad definitely did."],"Latitude":"43.202092","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Dover","There were no other sightings in Dover on or around January 31st 1961"],"Longitude":"-70.86814","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.202092,+-70.86814(25748)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25748) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Cigar","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25748.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25748.html"],"City":"Dover","Date of the Event":"01/31/1961 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10082010-0016","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"10/08/2010 08:37 UTC","Region":"New Hampshire","Summary":"Southern New Hampshire early 1961, as recounted by my father","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City"}
