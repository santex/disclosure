This is what I posted earlier today to my friends and family - We had a fire in the backyard, and saw a very bright light low on the southern horizon. It moved slowly toward the east, then stopped, brightened a LOT, then dimmed to almost nothing, brightened a LOT again and disappeared. Probably was engaging warp drive :) Then a couple of minutes later, saw another one moving from south to northeast, thought maybe it was a plane but very high up. Then it brightened a LOT, dimmed, moved a bit further to the northeast then stopped and brightened up a LOT, then stayed put for a long time."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-117.388196","City":"Riverside","Log Number":"US-08022010-0004","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"24895","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Riverside","There was one other sighting in Riverside on or around July 31st 2010"],"Date Submitted":"08/02/2010 01:31 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24895.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24895.html"]}
