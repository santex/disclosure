On a warm summer night, I was out in the front yard trying to look up at the stars and was having a hard time focusing. About that time, I realized the reason I was having a hard time focusing on the sky was because there was a large object in front of the sky. Upon closer inspection I quickly came to realize that this object had three straight sides and was a large triangle with a ball of light on each point. It slowly moved over my uncle's house toward the ocean and never made a sound."],"Country":"United States"}
