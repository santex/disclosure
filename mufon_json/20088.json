He stated that he briefly looked up at the sky and seen a massive bright yellow triangle that was there for a second then shot away where it fastly got smaller until it was gone, this all lasted a couple of seconds, i initially said it was a satellite until he went on further to say this was the size of a football pitch... he had no idea what it was but said its the first thing hes seen in the sky that he could not explain. Now most people i would not believe, but my nan and grandad always said they seen UFO's and now my brother is saying the same thing, he has no reason to lie and is a level headed normal person like myself. Any explanation for this?"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20088.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20088.html"],"trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Bristol","There were no other sightings in Bristol on or around October 22nd 2009"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Triangle"}
