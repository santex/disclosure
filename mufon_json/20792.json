As usual i was staring at the sky. I looked up to see a star like object traversing the sky. I watched it just glide across the sky. NO acceleration or movement really. I went inside to grab the binoculars to get a better look at the thing. When observed from a \"closer\" range, it appeared solid white. When i looked at it when it was further away, it looked almost like an orange pink color. I thought to myself that it had to be a satellite. I eventually lost sight of it after about 5-6 minutes. Just to note, there was ALOT of traffic in the sky. It seemed to me they were putting in alot of chemtrail work."],"Latitude":"42.50055","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Watched \"star\" move across sky","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","City":"Warren","Longitude":"-83.025267","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Warren","There were no other sightings in Warren on or around November 28th 2009"],"Case Number":"20792","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-11292009-0009"}
