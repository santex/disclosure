At or about 5 pm I was sitting out on her patio of a friends house I am visiting when watching the late afternoon aircraft heading into land at PHX, they were shinning and practically glowing in the low afternoon sun with a clear sky. I was facing East when I noticed off to my right a small object, traveling North, seemingly floating along rather lazily, almost hovering and assumed it was a balloon some child had lost grab of. I was hard to tell how high it was as it never was close enough visually to judge if it was in ���front��� of or ���behind��� the path of the aircraft. I really didn���t give it much thought however with the approach of the next aircraft I noticed it was till there and seemed to be almost at the same place. This caught my attention since it had not appeared to change position or altitude in those several minuets. I then observed this object for at least another 15 minuets. My first impression of it ���hovering��� was incorrect in fact it was very slowly ���drifting��� South along the same direction as the aircraft were heading toward PHX. I specifically say object since observing it I was able to determine it had volume and some colors; This was due to that low sun; although I was observing something that was approximately an eight of an inch to my eye at that distance and height (still unknown) it was enough to determine shading associated with a visual volume. I was still under the impression it was merely a balloon or perhaps a bunch of balloons sine there seem to be changes of color; orangeish yellowish and what seems to be either a whitish light of something reflecting, These color changes were not in sequence or of any discernible pattern but then I was looking at some rather tiny in my fielded of vision. After a few moments either I simply first noticed or it appeared suddenly behind this object (I will explain later how I determined that too was solid) another smaller bright silver ���dot���, I assume this was a ball. My first reaction up on seeing the second object was this indeed must be nothing more than a bunch of balloons but no sooner had I thought than I realized this was mostly likely not the case. I say that because it was about two and a half inches behind the first object. If it was a balloon that had separated from the bunch it was on a string of unlikely tremendous length. If it had separated from the bunch unattached it was following at exactly the same speed and altitude and in fact never altered from the full course of this event. In other words it maintained its relative position to the larger ���first��� object even during an interesting change of course. After several minuets of observation during which time it traveled from my far right to a position to just past my left, a path in constant speed and altitude for several minuets, I realized it was slowly turning toward my relative position, that is toward the West. As I continued to observe it drifted along making a large U-turn so as to be slightly in ���back��� of my position but almost to it, much closer than it was before. It then straightens out to what seemed a parallel path to its first observation and finally retreated out of my view. Once again there appeared to be no change in speed or altitude or the color changes and the same held true of the small following silver object. However after completing the U of the turn the small silver object behind turned dark, this indicated to me that it might be a reflective surface since the sunlight on it was now in a different position relative to my position and this was the ���shadow��� side I was now seeing. After a short time it was hard to see the small following silver object but the first object was at a constant level of brightness thorough out the observation leaving me to wonder if in fact it was self-illuminated rather than from the sunlight. I was never able to fully distinguish a ���shape��� for the first object but I was left with an impression it was more vertical, that is higher than wide. I did point these objects out to my friend who was coming in and out during the observation time but she was less interested so I at least have a witness who in fact saw the same thing. I have no idea if this is of any interest to you. As to my feelings? Well I have no strong opinion as to what this may have been but, however, it was most interesting to me and unlike anything I have ever observed, enough so to take this time to report my first very own UFO sighting."],"Summary":"Two unusual objects and movements","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00"}
