In front maybe underneath or to the right of the plane was a smaller object could have been diamond shaped or a disc was flying parallel to plane. the object itself lit up 3 or 4 separate times to a very bright light. seemed to be flying with at first i thought the plane was following the object. soon both objects disapeared over the a tree line. I was swimming in a pool and happened to look up. saw airplane flying over head with the cloud trail it leaves always have been facsinated by flight i guess. I thought at first, \"is the airplane following that object\" but then it looked like the object was just following along with the plane just out of view. The object flew straight with the plane lighting up bright white color like 3 or 4 times before it was out of sight. just thought to myself, what the heck could that be, and dang that's pretty cool. one of the strangest things i've seen in the sky. the plane and object were soon out of sight as they passed over a tree line and i lost sight of them. had eyes on for a good 30 seconds, of course in a pool i didn't have my phone handy."],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23869.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23869.html"],"Region":"North Carolina","Source":"MUFON","City":"Undisclosed"}
