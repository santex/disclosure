I was looking up at the sky to see if the moon was out and I saw a HUGE triangle shaped object with dim (foggy) lights along the edges passing overhead. I told my wife to look, and she asked me what it was. I told her I had no idea, but that it was HUGE. Living in Los Angeles I see passenger airliners overhead all the time, so I have a pretty good idea of perspective on their size. This object was flying at a higher altitude than they do, and it was 5 to 6 times their size! It was traveling west slowly, and we could not hear any noise coming from it. I have seen many things in my life, and I am NOT an alarmist or a \"wishful thinker\". I know that what we saw was real, and not something I have EVER seen before. We went inside after it passed by and checked the local news. Nothing. I then went online, and again, nothing. I would VERY much like to know if anyone else saw this object."],"Date of the Event":"04/16/2009 08:42 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Country":"United States","City":"Los Angeles"}
