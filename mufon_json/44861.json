I went out for a cigarette and saw an amber twinkling light flying near the airport. At first I thought a helicopter but after it for a couple of seconds I noticed it didn't have the light characteristics of any type of plane. I am an aviation enthusiast and I'm always Stargazing. While I watched it a plane passed the object and had normal light characteristics. The actual plane was a few miles south of the UFO and I could hear the actual plane where the UFO had no sound. After 45 seconds of noticing it weird it just vanished."],"trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There was one other sighting in San Jose on or around December 30th 2012"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/31/2012 12:39 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.345866,+-121.892396(44861)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44861) map </A>","City":"San Jose","Date of the Event":"12/30/2012 08:36 UTC","Summary":"looked like a lit cigar flying"}
