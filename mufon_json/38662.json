After a while, we had seen at least 8, and noticed they were changing direction, they were all rather close together. Then, once we were off the freeway, at an empty intersection we saw a ninth one, flying very, very fast and very low, the lowest we had seen, just above the roofs of buildings. then as we were watching it abruptly came to a complete stop, hovered for a while, which was really freaky, because we were the only ones at the intersection, it was almost as if it saw us watching it. then immediately got back up to speed, and bolted out of sight. we didn't see anymore after that. We were so intrigued, that we called some friends and family to ask what they knew about this."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38662.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38662.html"],"Object Features":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"05/29/2012 12:00 UTC","Summary":"9 diamond shaped aircrafts flying close together.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.612091,+-122.214702(38662)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38662) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Diamond","Tags":"City","Case Number":"38662","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
