I saw it first and thought it was a plane, then it turned around and came back and just hovered over some trees beside the house. I then pointed it out to the other people at the bbq, at first they said it was a plane, i asked them what kinda plane hovers like that, then they got scared and ran into the house. I was there with one other person that was to scared to run or do anything but stare at the object. It slowly moved over the house to the other side and hovered just above the tree tops about 20 to 35 ft above ground. Then the thing just stayed in one spot for what seemed like 10-20mins, i said to myself the hell with this and grabbed the other person and took them inside the house."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
