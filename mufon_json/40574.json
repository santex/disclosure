The orb was flashing orange colors and was flying at a high rate of speed (probably faster than an airplane). It shifted direction to the Southeast, until another orb appeared in the same spot as the first orb came out. The second orb was the same size as the first one. If hover the same path as the first. It almost looked the the second orb was following the first orb. When I first saw the first orb, it looked almost like a meteor was entering the atmosphere. When I saw change direction to the southeast, I knew for sure it was a UFO.
