i watched as they got closer and closer but soon our momentum with the traffic of i-84e took us too far and i couldn't see. i looked at the rest of the sky and saw 2 to 4 more on each side, coming from the mountains and clouds, and headed in the same direction - portland. i continued to panic, completely forgetting i had a camera sitting in the purse that i had so casually at my feet. trust me, i've regretted this every single day after and will for the rest of my life. i continued to see them appear to each side of us, and above us (i have to mention, these are all higher elevation than the one we first passed, that seemed low enough for us to be able to hear any noise and be deaf from it, if it were any normal aircraft - but it was silent. these were all at different heights but still much higher than that one. we soon noticed that we were following the tail end of a thunderstorm, headed northeast like we were. it seemed like these crafts were coming out of that storm, headed south\\southwest. soon, there were no more, and i had my face glued to the windows the rest of the night, not wanting to miss a single second of possibly seeing any more. because i was sure, if i stared at it long enough, i would be enlightened to what it was, and be assured that it wasn't going to bomb portland. the storm, which ended up right where we were headed, was a strong one, tons of lightning and thunder and apparently even started some wildfires in yakima, our destination. we arrived in yakima with the horizon tinted with the glowing red of fires, very common in that area in the summertime. we eventually dared to say it - that they might have been ufo's, something not human. we still tossed around bombers and military crafts but the nagging feeling that we just saw something amazing and otherworldly just wouldn't leave us. we were shaken up. i have no idea if any other cars saw this - i honestly didn't look anywhere but the sky as soon as this started. and between the three of us, we can't seem to agree which lights were red and which were white, and sadly, three years long its been and i couldn't tell you which colors were where. our minds were overwhelmed with trying to figure out what was happening, i think. it lasted a while - i did not look at any clocks during this time and it both seemed over so fast and also an eternity - depending on when my fear was at its most. it was late, so i could not call anyone back home to see if they saw anything in the sky, or you know, got bombed. we went home the next day and asked, and no one seemed to have seen or heard about what we saw. no one was bombed. everything was fine. i probably should have reported this, but i didn't know where to go to report it and i felt like no one would believe me if i spoke to strangers about it. my family was hard enough, but i sat down and drew diagrams and was determined to at least help them understand that iiii believe what i saw. but i still do not know what i saw. but this is the type of things you need reported, correct? i hope that my report helps, i'm sorry it took 3 years for me to find out who to go to and realize its important enough to report at all. i don't know if i should also mention this, but around the same time in 2011 i was sitting in the back yard of my friends house in beaverton oregon, and we were discussing \"deep\" subjects and looking at the stars, when two objects that we thought were merely satellites started moving erratically, impossibly, then disappeared into nothing. i have been an avid meteor-shower watcher and sky gazer my whole life, well trained by my science and space loving mother, and i know satellites and stars and that was certainly neither! it was fast, but not like a bug, but nothing like how any aircraft can move. went in tight zigzags for a moment then flew off into nowhere, just gone. me and my friend looked at each other and just went \"uhhh....did you see what i saw?!\" and felt a tingle in our spines. that was certainly less scary than our 2010 experience! this, by the way, was a different friend, than the one with us in the car the night of the triangles. it was her first sighting of anything like that, haha. we were both just grinning silly and couldn't help but talk about more 'interesting' topics after that. i felt emboldened to speak about my experience with the triangles, and she took it well. anyway, thank you for letting me tell my story. i hope i helped, at all. (and sorry i didn't have the presence of mind to get my camera out - i'm never letting myself off the hook for that as long as i live - and i hope i'm better prepared if i ever see anything strange like that again!) -deanna"],"City":"Portland","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/09/2010 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-06212012-0032","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/39699.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/39699.html"]}
