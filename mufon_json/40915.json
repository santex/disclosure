I am in Weeki Wachee, Fl. This is north Tampa by an hour or so. I got up and went out for the paper. Pretty black outside, still could see stars. Out of nowhere, low on horizon I saw a green orb traveling from northeast to the southwest. It arced over the roof of our home and disappeared. It was slow moving on the downside of the arc, and I did not see a tail. Amazed and in awe!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.570447","Case Number":"40915"}
