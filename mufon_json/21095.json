The object seemed to be almost oval in shape and was pulsating redish light. My dogs took off and darted across the field towards the object as it droped like a stone out of the sky.My nieace and I were both terrified, I told her to go inside with the childern. I grabbed a flashlight and reluctantly went to cross the field calling out for my dogs but before I reached the edge of the field they both came running back. I went inside and locked up the house. I told my wife about it when she came home, she wasn,t suprised because of somthing we both wittnesed not far from here a few years before."],"Summary":"seen above tree line behind house","Date Submitted":"12/23/2009 11:17 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball, Oval, Sphere","Log Number":"US-12232009-0005","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21095.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21095.html"],"Region":"Maryland","Case Number":"21095","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.965278,+-75.649722(21095)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21095) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Longitude":"-75.649722","Date of the Event":"03/09/2007 09:15 UTC","Latitude":"37.965278"}
