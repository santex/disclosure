{"City":"Franklin","divs":["sighting detailsat 9:40 on 7\\15\\11, i was driving down the ramp at exit two on south 675 and as i was speeding up to blend with the traffic, this object appeared ahead of me, that had red lights at each corner and was banking to to the right at about a 45 degree angle over the horizon, which appeared to about or less than a few miles(maybe 5). my thought process was, that appeared to be the kind of ufo that seen in paris in 2008, though that one had green lights, it appeared the same shape and design. zipping down the highway and getting on to i-75 south, i visually lost it for a moment, because of trees, then out ahead of me, and there were a few cars nearby, i pointed at it, like i was looking at it from behind it suddenly turned to the right and all the red lights at the corners were visible with a white light in the center and it leveled off and banked to the left and i saw a thin band of red lights that appeared to encase the outline around the vehicle and it appeared to be going away from my line of sight, even though i was traveling at almost 80 mph, ( i was excited), this is really cool. i thought for a moment, isn't anyone else seeing what i'm seeing?as i gained control of my destination down 75 south, i caught sight of it again, and it was banking to to the right and leveled off again. the full moon was just appearing in the east out of a cloud bank and with a glimsp of the vehicle it shot to the east, like a bottle rocket , leaving a tail of light. as i exited south 75 at exit 38, a traingular object was just hovering in the sky, near this exit, that had a white light that appeared to be surveying the area and it appeared there for almost a minute. whence i came off the highway, down the ramp and stopped at the ramp, with a few cars\\trucks ahead of me at the red light, i got out of my car and looked around, nothing. rats.but what i saw was, not of this world, not man made and i hope we can invite to live with us, because i believe we are not alone. \"the truth is out there\" and i would love to meet someone from another world, that my god created."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"08/02/2011 03:05 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30205.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30205.html"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Ohio","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.015474,+-82.993161(30205)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30205) map </A>","Latitude":"40.015474","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-08022011-0033","Object Shape":"Triangle","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-82.993161","Case Number":"30205","Summary":"red lights at the corners, white light in the center, at dusk","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Franklin","There was one other sighting in Franklin on or around July 15th 2011"],"Date of the Event":"07/15/2011 09:40 UTC"}
