Just South of 116th and Oleo Road. South bank of Geist Reservoir. I was looking northeast of my location. I noticed in the distance, two large, bright red-orange spheres or large, bright red-orange round lights that moved in locked unison to each other slowly to the northeast. The red-orange color was intense. In a minute or so, the top sphere faded out then, the bottom sphere flickered out. The color of the bottom sphere went to white as it flickered out. The spheres were stacked above each other slightly off verticle alignment. A large distance was estimated to separate them from each other. Whatever it was was estimated to be large. Duration 1-2 minutes total observation time. Fireworks were going off between me and the spheres. Not a firework. Not a plane. Not a blimp."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.961813,+-86.010463(24222)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24222) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"24222","Disposition":"Unknown"}
