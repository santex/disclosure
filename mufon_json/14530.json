{"Log Number":"US-12262008-0001","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.955735","divs":["Sighting Details On monday december 22 I was watching tv around 10-11 at night with my brother. Something caught my attention outside, so I took galnce at my field behind me. I saw a bright ball falling to the ground. I jumped up and told my brother to look outside. I thought someone shot a firework into our field.(And no there is no neighbors around just woods) The bright ball had a little bit of an arch to it but it disapeared and there were no signs of a ground impact. I didnt think much of it until december 26 12:16 when my friend was waiting for me outside to leave. He came back in, and described the exact same thing i saw a few days earlier. This was strange because my brother was the only one who knew what I had seen. My friend and I both agreed that the object came very close to the ground and was only a few hundred feet away from the house. It was only around for a few seconds before disappearing.(It was not a fire work!)"],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/26/2008 12:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Neon Green light fell from the sky","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14530.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14530.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.955735,+-75.155039(14530)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14530) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Philadelphia","Date Submitted":"12/26/2008 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-75.155039","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"14530","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There was one other sighting in Philadelphia on or around December 26th 2008"]}
