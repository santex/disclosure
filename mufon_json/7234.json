When i saw the object it was very close almost directly overhead and i could see most of its details. It had no visable openings and no contrail behind it also it didn't make a sound. At first the object started moving to my left a picked up speed and then abrutbly turned around and went in the other direction. At this time i ran back to my house to get my camera and by the time i got back it was gone. I asked the peope who saw it were it went and they said it just vaniahed into thin air.
