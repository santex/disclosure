We drove into his neighborhood and parked the car and continued to star out at the sky. I saw an second object that looked the same but appeared to have a different colored light as well do the same thing, fall fast, except this one was at more of a diagonal than straight down. Could have been the same object, but unknown. I have seen shooting stars and this was not one. It was my first ufo experience and it was unbelievable. Several planes and helicopters entered the sky afterwards, two helicopters side by side with bright lights very close overhead, looked as if they were searching. Very suspicious."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Case Number":"33983"}
