I was in a restaurant sitting out doors next to the water. I was eating alone so when looked up and saw this strange object and strange light patterns moving so quiet and yet so close I was shocked. I did take out my phone and was able to get video evidence but by the time I started recording the UFO was already on the other side of the bay. I was still able to capture on video the UFO actually disappearing right in front of your eyes and re appear again. It also descended as if to land. I have this evidence on my phone and will be more than happy to show you."],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Quincy","There were no other sightings in Quincy on or around August 6th 2011"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12082011-0022","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-70.99617","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","City":"Quincy","Date of the Event":"08/06/2011 07:08 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.254227,+-70.99617(33905)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33905) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33905.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33905.html"],"Case Number":"33905","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"All caught on my cell phone must see to believe"}
