I noticed there were three glowing disc-shapped objects in the sky that zig-zagged left and right in a forward motion. A distance behind the 3 was another one that trailed behind about the distance of the 3 that followed each other. We were in awe to have seen what we initially thought were balloons, but we started questioning why we heard the humming and why they moved in maticulous fashion. So we discounted them being balloons. I tried captioring video with my HD camera, but It was too dark and they were atleast 3 miles high in the sky."],"trends":[],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Longitude":"-119.415422","Country":"United States","Region":"California","City":"Undisclosed"}
