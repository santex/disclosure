My friend was telling us to look up at the sky and that's when we saw the two objects. He wanted us to see what he saw because he wanted witness not just himself. I kept looking at the two objects making sure it was what he told me because my friend had experienced seeing these objects various times. The two objects had bright lights they were moving in place but u could notice that they were nothing similiar to any airplane or helicopter. If u looked at it u could see it had a red circleing light and it spun. When i noticed it was an UFO event i was surprised that i actually got to experience this but i wanted to see more because the two objects disapeared like if they were never there."],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash","Summary":"The two object had a bright light they were circular shaped and it moved in place.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"20683","Region":"Massachusetts","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","City":"Fitchburg","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Fitchburg","There were no other sightings in Fitchburg on or around November 19th 2009"]}
