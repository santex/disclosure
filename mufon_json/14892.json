{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife and I were at the park. The wind was high and we were walking the dogs. We go to the park a lot mostly so I can fly my RC airplanes but the wind was too strong. After walking the dogs we were about to leave and I decided to take some radom pictures of the sky. In the first picture you can see the object. The next picture was taken just a second later as I moved the camera only slightly to take another picture. The object did not appear in the second shot. We did not see or hear anthing. The strange thing about this shot is that of a report I filed earlier last year we were standing in the opening between the trees in the picture and a star like object came from the south to the same position and stoped. It stayed in that same spot for about 15 min then faded away. If the report can be checked I think it was at about the same time of day."],"City":"McKinney","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","Date Submitted":"01/09/2009 05:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.202976,+-96.636542(14892)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14892) map </A>","Object Shape":"Saturn-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"14892","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"01/09/2009 05:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14892.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14892_submitter_file1__100_2431.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/14892_submitter_file2__100_2432.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14892.html"],"Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 30 other sightings in McKinney","There were no other sightings in McKinney on or around January 9th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Taking random pictures in the park caught Saturn like object.","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-96.636542","Latitude":"33.202976","Log Number":"US-01122009-0004","Country":"United States"}
