It was strange because it seemed to spin in 2 directions both around and over (if that makes sense). Anyway I stopped the car and watched it~ it did not last long 15 sec. or so. Then it just DISAPPEARED! and it made NO SOUND AT ALL! I kinda coughed it up to Fort Gordon property backing up to mine~ maybe this was a man made object~ I don't know~ but I know I did SEE it what ever it was."],"Date Submitted":"07/02/2010 08:01 UTC","Latitude":"33.414583","Log Number":"US-07022010-0003"}
