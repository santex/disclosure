{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI live about 10 miles from the Pittsburgh International Airport. It was the weekend of Wings over Pittsburgh Air Show hosted by the 911th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve Command. May 10 - 11 2008. I heard the jets getting close to here, where they make there turn and return back to the base. When I first looked out the window in the door, I was looking up trying to see the jets and when I didn���t see the jets then I glanced down and I seen the > V formation. It is hard to explain but it just did not fit, it was like a insert, it looked identical to cd discs except no center hole but the reflection was identical and a perfect V formation. I have heard that there are more sightings when there is a war, now there was no war here but there was unusual air activity. When I seen it over McMichell Rd. I think it was stationary for a while then it started moving slowly to the right and I seen it go behind the trees at my neighbors house across the street, I thought I would continue seeing them but it never came out from behind the trees. It was energy of some kind. I did not take my eyes off of it. It never entered my brain to get a camera, I was just locked on to it. If someone would have put 7 cd discs in a v formation on a long sheet of Plexiglas and was moving it to the right out side my door that is what it looked like. It stood out, it was on top of the view I was seeing but it went behind my neighbors trees across the street. It just did not belong there, do you know what I mean. it was memorizing, I could feel it, or I was like connected to it in a way. I did not count the discs but when I drew them on the computer 7 discs looker closer to what I seen compared to five discs. One thing for sure it was a perfect even V, but in this direction > . It was so different from photos and videos of UFO's I have seen. I don���t think it carried passengers. It just looked like energy. I always wondered why people took a sighting so serious and went to gatherings. I am hooked now. I will always be searching for what I seen. It only lasted maybe a minute. There is no way it was of this earth. The object I seen makes all the others I have seen photos of look primitive. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 7 Discs in a V formation, like this. ￼ Things like this don���t fly. But these discs did. I was not looking up. I was looking out, like this. ￼ This is not the first time I had seen something, about 40 years ago I was in WV, south of Moundsville late at night and we were up on a detour above closed RT 2, and it was dark no houses around and my friend and myself seen light, that is it, just light, but I know I was going across the top on the detour when we seen the light, but I remember being back down on RT 2 and one of us said to one another, did you see that and the other said yes and we never talked about it after that. I did not see anything, I just remember light. we grew up together but still we never brought it up again. Why ? Years later he moved away and we never keep in touch."],"Date Submitted":"10/22/2009 06:18 UTC","Case Number":"20074","Region":"Pennsylvania","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Pittsburgh","Longitude":"-79.992676","Log Number":"US-10222009-0004","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20074.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20074.html"],"trends":["There have been 122 other sightings in Pittsburgh","There were no other sightings in Pittsburgh on or around May 10th 2008"],"Latitude":"40.449495","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/10/2008 01:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.449495,+-79.992676(20074)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20074) map </A>","Summary":"7 cd type dics in a > V formation"}
