{"Object Shape":"Disc","divs":["sighting detailsi was sitting on the train coming home from college & it had stopped over killiney bay for 5 minutes. it was approx 4pm on a sunny, clear day. i noticed 2 bright lights over the sea hovering. 1 going straight up about 50 ft and 1 staying over the water, both going up & down in sync & together up and down. at first i thought they were helicopters moving at incredible speed. it never entered my head that they were ufos as i never believed in them, until the bright lights went out. i could see very clearly 2 disc shaped objects hovering about 10ft over the sea. they both rose up at the same time to approx 100 ft for maybe 10 sec then they both did a half loop and sped off in the same direction to the clouds at an unbelievable speed. it was inredible. there seemed to be a haze \\ distortion that followed them as they sped off. as they were passing through the clouds, i saw a further 2-3 more objects follow them in a single line. i lost them as they went into the clouds. i was gobsmacked. i looked around to see if anyone saw but everyone seemed to have their heads in books \\ phones or whatever. there was only about 10 people on my carraige. i felt shocked & moved. i told my parents about it straight away & my mother made me draw the object.i dont know where it is now as it was so long ago. she wanted me to report it but i was too embarrassed. i didn't want everyone thinking i was a 'weirdo' and made up the story. that weekend it was all over the irish sunday papers & there were loads of sightings, not just the one i witnessed. so i never really talked about until recently & now i feel ashamed that i didn't. it takes more balls to say something like that that could ruin your reputation. this is my very first time reporting it. i have no pictures or evidence but know what i saw, this was not from this planet."],"Longitude":"-6.119718","Log Number":"IE-08102010-0007","Date Submitted":"08/10/2010 04:40 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/01/1999 04:00 UTC","Latitude":"53.245894","Summary":"2 metalic disc shaped objects hovering over Killiney Bay.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25054.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25054.html"],"Region":"County Dublin","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","City":"Dun Laoghaire","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.245894,+-6.119718(25054)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25054) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Dun Laoghaire","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"25054","Country":"Ireland","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Dome"}
