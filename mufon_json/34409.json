As I was walking to get a good view I noticed at least 2 objects floating slowly towards where the fireworks were going to go off. They just stopped outside the area where they go off. I was really mezmorized by the lights trying to figure out what exactly they were. Everything from plane, to helicopter, to jet went through my mind. I ended up crossing those all off the list because they always have a blinking lights to let you know they are there. These objects had red lights, they did not blink. They just stayed there like they were watching what was going to happen. I watched for a bit and had to just say I was imagining things. After the fireworks were over I noticed they were gone but I also noticed some jets coming to our area. They were flying in the same area I had seen the red lights. It really was strange."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34409.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34409.html"],"Latitude":"40.789022","Country":"United States"}
