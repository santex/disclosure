I called my parents who were inside on my cell phone to come out and see it. They didn't make it out in time to see it, it went behind a tree and I lost sight. I later saw that the ISS was making fly overs that week so I figured it was that, however I watched 4-5 of the flyovers after that to \"see it again\" but even the brightest -4.0 magnitude was easily 100x smaller and not as bright as the UFO I saw, the ISS was also not red during any of its fly overs. I then googled \"UFO July 4, 2010\" and found one video that was the exact object I saw. unlike many of the UFOs that day mine was a single globe instead of the triangular formation of 3. There could have been more around but I was very focused on that one that I did not check the rest of the sky around me. It was not flashing or strobing. We have many planes that fly over our house so I know it was not a plane of any kind."],"Case Number":"24535","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24535.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24535.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"Red glowing globe of light, slowing rotating headed NE.","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON"}
