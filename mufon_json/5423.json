{"divs":["Sighting DetailsNotice what I thought was three airplanes in the sky about 3 miles up. However, they were to close together and I am certain air traffic control would not allow this to happen (I was in the Air Force). As I continued looking, the two orbs stopped and appeared stationary. It was daylight and could not possibly be stars. The plane flew onward. I could hear the plane but not the orbs. Then the orbs simply vanished straight into orbit."],"City":"Oklahoma City","trends":["There have been 78 other sightings in Oklahoma City","There were no other sightings in Oklahoma City on or around September 19th 2006"],"Case Number":"5423","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Oklahoma","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.47496,+-97.515038(5423)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5423) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/19/2006 07:30 UTC","Longitude":"-97.515038","Log Number":"US-09202006-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5423.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5423.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"35.47496","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"2 Orange Orbs follwing airplane","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/19/2006 07:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown"}
