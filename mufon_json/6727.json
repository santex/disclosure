{"divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and i were watching tv when my eyes were drawn to an extremely bright orb-like object in the skies over omaha. since i am a mufon field investigator and retired usaf specops aviator, i know what aircraft, satellites, and other aerial objects look like from a distance. my wife acquired visual confirmation of the same object nearly immediately upon my calling it out. we both rose from the couch to stand at our west-looking windows. while she watched w\\the naked eye, i grabbed my 10x50 simmons model 1107 redline binoculars and focused in on the object. it was during this time we noted the object was passing underneath the westbound jetliner in what appeared to be an identical flightpath, w\\the airliner at roughly 35k agl or wnw some 30 degrees above the horizon, while the silver orb was on the same course at roughly 20 degrees above the horizon. the orb was traveling much faster, possibly mach i or greater. we noted several other aircraft contrails at that time, and omaha pd's \"air one\" patrol helo was also airborne further to the north, flying at a much lower altitude. as i focused in on the object in question, i determined it was not one silver orb, but two small orbs flying in close quarters (they may have in fact been one craft made up of two orbs.) after viewing the object for another 10 seconds or so, i ran to get my digital camera while my wife maintained her eyes-on-target. by the time i returned w\\the camera some 10 seconds later, the object had disappeared while she attempted to acquire it thru binoculars. we searched the skies for several minutes afterward but never reacquired the object visually. i had previously only seen anomolous lights in the sky, and my wife had never seen anything anomolous, lights, craft, or whatever."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6727.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6727.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/01/2007 05:53 UTC","Longitude":"-95.994808","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-04012007-0008","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Omaha","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 83 other sightings in Omaha","There were no other sightings in Omaha on or around April 1st 2007"],"Summary":"Silver Orb(s) pacing Jetliner over Omaha","Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"04/01/2007 05:53 UTC","Latitude":"41.256163","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Nebraska","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.256163,+-95.994808(6727)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6727) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"6727"}
