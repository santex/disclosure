Saw the object when looking to my left while I was driving. Object seem to appear when I was about half way between Miller rd. and Hwy. 66 (Lakeview Prky.)My wife who was with me saw it at the same time I did. At first thought it was a meteor, but realized it was bigger than any meteor I had seen before and it had an oval or oblong shape and was white in color with what appeared to be light fragments moving in front of the bigger object. The object appeared to be heading in a downward trajectory and disappeared over the horizon very quickly. Our children who were with us and riding in the back seat did not see it at all even though my wife and I inquired if they saw what we had seen. My feelings were of awe and curiosity as I've never seen anything that looked like what I saw."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"03/23/2011 09:10 UTC","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-03242011-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.909102,+-96.55615(28372)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28372) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Case Number":"28372","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28372.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28372.html"],"Longitude":"-96.55615","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Texas","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Rowlett"}
