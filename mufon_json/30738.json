{"divs":["Sighting DetailsA big group of us arived at lake mead marina with boat and camping gear for the memorial day weekend @ 8:30 p.m. we decided to make two runs in the boat Reggie John & I (Rich) would take all the camping gear in the boat and find our camp site about 2 miles across the lake. the 2nd run would pick all the others and back to the camp site. During the crossing the boat hit something in the water and it sheared the prop pin, as this has happened before I had a spare pin. so I went over the side into the water to installed the new pin. I looked up to have Reggie hand me the new pin I saw this enormous big black triangle with lights at each corner that seem to be hovering over us and completly silent I asked the others if they were seeing what I was seeing and could not believe their eyes. Then we saw the two other craft that were farther away and alot higher. we watched these craft for at least 5min. until they ascended upward without making any noise."],"Date Submitted":"08/09/2011 08:46 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Dome, Window(s), Louvres","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.954671,+-114.837945(30738)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30738) map </A>","Case Number":"30738","Date of the Event":"05/28/1982 09:05 UTC","Longitude":"-114.837945","City":"Boulder City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Boulder City","There were no other sightings in Boulder City on or around May 28th 1982","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.954671","Log Number":"US-08092011-0032","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Nevada","Summary":"Large black triangles / made no sound hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30738.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30738.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
