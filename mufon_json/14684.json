The glowing brightness caught my eye. I look at the sky often and pretty much know the constellations that are normal for this time of year. This was a odd sight in a normally dark spot in the sky. Temp in the Pittsburgh Pa. area is in the mid 20's I believe, and except for a few scattered clouds, it���s a clear, crisp night. There were 2 of them at 1st, moving very slowly in unison, almost as if they were attached by an invisible string. They were seperated a good distance apart although I can not fairly judge that distance except to say that it was maybe the distance from the top to the bottom of the Big Dipper. I immediately called for my husband to come out and see and he just said \"what the heck is that!\" It was obvious we were seeing something very different. They were moving way too slow for a plane, made no sound and did not blink. They just looked like small red fireballs or large red colored stars. I���d guess they were about 3 times the size of the North star. (In my mind then, I wondered if it was someone flying a hot air balloon at night with a large flair of some sort!) We watched them move southward slowly in the sky for about 5-6 min. even going into the back yard to see them better. Then they just disappeared. We originally thought they went behind cloud cover, but the clouds were sparse and would have emerged quickly. But they were gone in an instant. We kept looking for them and waiting for them to reappear but they didn't, so my hubby & I went in. I went outside several more times to look again and as I was going out the door maybe 5 min. later, I saw another single one moving out of the northern sky again coming toward the area of our home. It seemed to be lower at first that the other 2. I called for the hubby again and he came out and told me to grab the binoculars since his telecsope was put away for the winter. I brought out both pair and we both looked at this \"thing\" but it just looked like a red fireball in the lens. It moved slowly as well and it also disappeared in the exact spot that the other 2 did. It almost looked like it fizzled out when it got to that same spot, as we were both watching it with the binoculars. We told out daughter about it and she told me to do a google search to see if anyone else saw anything or if there was something going on that would explain it. When I did the search, all I entered was \"Pittsburgh Pa. Jan. 1, 2009. red balls in sky\". Immediately, I got a \"hit\" that someone in Indiana saw exactly the same thing we did, but I believe the time was a little different. Reading on, I see where people all over the world saw the same thing. Someone posted a short video of exactly what we saw on UFO Stalker dot com but there was only one on their video. We only saw 3 of them but others have seen many more. Perhaps there were more & we only caught the tail end, but we definitely saw something that was unlike anything we've ever seen before and it was nothing short of amazing. And no one will tell me it was a weather balloon either! I wonder if now I'll start making mountains out of my mashed potatoes??? LOL So glad others have seen it as well."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","Latitude":"40.443025","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14684","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01012009-0029"}
