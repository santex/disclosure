{"Latitude":"43.046342","Summary":"greenish-white fireball shoots horizontally from south to north for about one second","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Case Number":"5114","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy sister and I had just gotten out of the car and were walking north up the driveway when I saw a greenish-white ball of light shoot across the horizon from south to north. It lasted about one second and then disappeared out of sight. I asked my sister if she just saw the shooting star and she said \"Is that what that was?\" I suppose it could have been a shooting star, but it was much larger in size than a shooting star and the vivid green color of it was unlike any shooting star I'd ever seen. Am wondering if anyone else in southeastern Wisconsin last night saw this? When I got in the house I immediately did a Google search on \"report UFO\" and came across this website and UFO Wisconsin, where I also filed a report."],"Date Submitted":"07/19/2006 12:30 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.046342,+-87.902664(5114)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (5114) map </A>","Date of the Event":"07/19/2006 12:30 UTC","City":"Milwaukee","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Milwaukee","There were no other sightings in Milwaukee on or around July 19th 2006"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5114.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5114.html"],"Longitude":"-87.902664","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07192006-0008","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Wisconsin","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
