They were fairly low and made no noise. They did not warble but were in perfect alignment and moved with ease and purpose very slowly until out of sight. Here is a spliced together video clip made from 3 short videos I was able to get...sorry about the quality my camera will not let me focus or view through the eyepiece when in record mode and it gives me a lot of trouble with less than stellar results. I'd like to say I see a lot of weird things in the sky around here. I don't know what these are but thought it was odd enough to report."],"City":"Roseville","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19185.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19185.html"],"trends":["There have been 31 other sightings in Roseville","There were no other sightings in Roseville on or around September 8th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"09/08/2009 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09092009-0015","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"2 slowly moving starlike objects. 1 larger than the other and following the other.","Latitude":"38.755364"}
