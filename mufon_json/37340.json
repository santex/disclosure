It's lights were flickering and it seemed to hover. There was an air plane flying close by it. I don't know what it was doing. There seemed to be no hostility from either parties. Then the ship headed west from the east and flew right over our heads. It was oval shaped and had a red light on the right side and a blue one on the left. It seemed to move in slight zig zags as it flew by, past our heads and out of sight. We were all very surprised. My friends asked what it was and I told them it was a ufo. It was an incredible thing to be able to see."],"Summary":"It was oval shaped with a red light on one side and a blue light on the other, with white head lights.","Latitude":"40.421237","Longitude":"-82.900503","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37340.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37340.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-04102012-0004","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Case Number":"37340","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ohio"}
