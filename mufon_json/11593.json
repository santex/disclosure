The two were flying in wing abreast formation when we saw them from our balcony. I ran and got the camcorder, and when I came back they had split up but still remained close. Colors and shape seemed to shift slightly. Objects roll among all three axis with no sound. I had my doubts about them being UFO's, however I took it to the airport and showed it to a couple of other pilots, and their opinion was inconclusive. I believe them to be remote-control vehicles. Either way, they recommended I contact you."],"Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"Objects were approx. 1000ft AGL","Region":"California","City":"Mission Viejo","Date Submitted":"07/13/2008 10:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc, Oval","Longitude":"-117.664625","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11593.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11593_submitter_file1__ufo1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11593_submitter_file2__ufo2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11593.html"],"Case Number":"11593","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Mission Viejo","There were no other sightings in Mission Viejo on or around July 13th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
