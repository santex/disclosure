{"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange orb flying low heading southeast.","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were driving north on 435 about 4 miles southeast of Kansas City International Airport. We saw several planes around the area then we noticed an orange orb flying low bascially following interstate 435 toward the southeast in the opposite direction of us. There were 4 of us in the car that all witnessed and watched this. We watched it for about 2 minutes until it was too far south to see it. There was a plane that flew about 1,000 feet right above the orb so you could distinctly tell the difference between a blinking plane and this orange orb. The orb was flying slow, I would guess around 30 mph and about 100' to 200' above the ground. It was flying in a very straight line not eradic at all."],"City":"Kansas City","Log Number":"US-07062009-0014","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.102786,+-94.574977(17869)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17869) map </A>","Case Number":"17869","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17869.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17869.html"],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"07/05/2009 09:50 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/05/2009 09:50 UTC","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were no other sightings in Kansas City on or around July 5th 2009"],"Latitude":"39.102786","Longitude":"-94.574977","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"Missouri","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States"}
