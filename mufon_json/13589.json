Saint Helen's Volcano. I have family in the area, so I check on it once or twice a week. Any way when I saw this come up I down loaded a picture of it. All pertinent info is at the top of the photo. Is it a UFO, an anomaly of light and cloud's? I don't know. After thinking about it for a while I decided to send it to you guys. Maybe you can get the recording tape for the time in question.
