I exited my vehicle and looked to the stars, but what I saw was much closer. Just over one of the houses, I saw a shape start to move. It was about 15-20 feet wide and 10 feet tall. It was a disc and had panels on the bottom that looked a lot like lights. I started to panic and I think they had picked up on it. The ufo was stealthed though, the outline was distinctly moving and it was close enough that I could make out very clearly what it was. The ufo disappeared completely after about 5 visible seconds. It vanished into thin air, I can't believe I blew my one shot at meeting aliens."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Case Number":"33954","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/10/2011 10:31 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Date of the Event":"12/01/2011 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City"}
