{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking with my parents out of a restaurant on a summer night. A couple probably also from the restaurant were looking up. I saw a disc shaped saucer with a brightly lit room above the gray body part of the ship. With a closer look I saw a human looking man who seemed to be moving about with other aliens not human inside. There was no sound. After about 5 minutes, it made and S-shaped exit and just disappeared with no sound. I pinched myself and spoke to the others during all of this to make sure it was no hallucination."],"Longitude":"-73.671797","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Lynbrook","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Dome, Other","Latitude":"40.654825","Date Submitted":"08/08/1974 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-07292009-0003","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18376.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/08/1974 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"18376","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.654825,+-73.671797(18376)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18376) map </A>","City":"Lynbrook","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Summary":"Gray in color, lights underneath, Oval disc shaped, lighted room with occupants.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Region":"New York"}
