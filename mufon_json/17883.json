What make it stand out was it had no white collision light, just a red one. In looking further we spotted a much dimmer red light at the front of the craft. We could barely see the outline but it looked oval or cigar-shaped. Straight and level flight a little slower than the jets which fly over. We are located near an airway so it's easy to distinguish real airplanes from what we saw last night."],"Date of the Event":"07/05/2009 10:51 UTC","Log Number":"US-07062009-0028","Longitude":"-117.208623","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
