{"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"09/16/2012 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-09232012-0020","Summary":"Two star-like lights traveled in tandem","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-106.687792","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was sitting out in the patio looking at the stars. I was looking directly up at the stars when I noticed that two stars seemed to be moving. I watched and confirmed that the two lights, which I had thought were part of the constellation, began moving together in tandem. The two light moved very slowly southeast together, keeping the same distance apart from each other - around the width of my thumb at arm's length. The objects moved slowly to the southeast. After around 15 seconds the first light flared brightly and then faded. Then the second light flared brightly and also faded. I watched the pair of lights, wondering what they could be, as they slowly moved southeast. After approximately a minute and after the lights flared brightly, the two objects continued slowly southeast and then slowly faded out of sight. I thought the lights may have been a satellite, so I checked with Stellarium and found no satellites crossing the sky at that time and place. The lights were separated from each other, so I thought they might be the ISS, but did not find it in that area. I thought they might have been satellites, but realized that their distance was too large to be a single satellite or solar panels. It was very strange to see the two lights travel together."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/23/2012 05:51 UTC","Region":"New Mexico","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.112958,+-106.687792(42770)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42770) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42770.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42770.html"],"trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were no other sightings in Albuquerque on or around September 16th 2012"],"Case Number":"42770","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"35.112958","City":"Albuquerque"}
