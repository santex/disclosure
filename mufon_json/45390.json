As the object drew nearer, flying directly overhead, I could see it was triangle shaped with several lights, one or two red lights also, and moved about 30 mph. It passed directly overhead and headed north. It moved eastward about a mile north of us, and then turned south about two miles to the east. If I hadn't seen the video of the flying triangle sighting from Warren, MI the week before, I wouldn't have paid any attention. I'm sure most people just ignored it, thinking it was a low flying plan. But it made no sound, traveled no more than 30 mph, and was shaped like a triangle, each side approx. 50-75 feet long."],"Case Number":"45390","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date of the Event":"01/18/2013 06:30 UTC","Longitude":"-83.414752","Summary":"Flying triangle flew from the south over Middlebelt Road at Northwestern Hwy; turned east at 14 mile and then south over Telegraph Rd.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45390.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45390.html"],"Log Number":"US-01242013-0005"}
