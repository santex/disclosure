I am nearsighted and I did not have my glasses on, so I could not see detail at that distance, nor could I tell the distance in the dark. Peripherally I noticed a large, bright moving object almost directly overhead and looked up. It was traveling directly south (or perhaps falling in front of me) at a speed that would be very fast if distant or falling, glider speed if it were only skimming the three-story-tall trees I was near. I only observed it for a couple of seconds traveling in a straight line before it was obscured by the tree foliage. I was in a small clearing. There was no noise. My first thought was, \"Could that have been a shooting star.\" My second thought was, \"No, that was way, way, way too big to be a shooting star.\" My next thought was a firework, but I eliminated that as there was absolutely no sound in that very quiet neighborhood. My next thought was perhaps I should report it to the police. My last thought was perhaps I should report it to Mufon. I immediately entered my car and noted the time--one minute after midnight."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5707.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5707.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
