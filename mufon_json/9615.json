My wife and two friends accompanied me.Fifteen minuetes south of Dayton in the Franklin Ohio area three bright objects appeared in the sky. Two of the lights were close together, several yards apart and another about a quarter mile from the other. The light that was hovering by itself would disappear and appear again in several seconds. The lights were clearly not stars or aircraft. I have lived next to Wright Field And Dayton International and I have never seen such objects hover so brightly as these ojects. They appeared for two minuets or slightly more and then disapperared. They did not appear to travel away but were simply not there like a light going off. All that were in the vehicle saw the objects but are in denial and will not discuss the sighting. So, I am telling this because I have the guts to do so.
