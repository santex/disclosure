It was extremely cold today in northern Florida- the high was 46 and not a cloud was to be found in a brillant blue, crisp winter sky. This object was reflecting so much silver light my first impression was that it was a plane moving high into the atmosphere with the sun reflecting light off the side. Only it didn't move. It stayed suspended in the air, without waivering or moving and then slowly completely disappeared!!! I then heard military jets nearby and then saw two on opposite sides of where the object had been. The two jets started streaking around the sky. It appeared to me that they were 'cornering' but I had seen it vanish from plain sight."]}
