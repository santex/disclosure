As soon as they appeared they were gone. We saw them about four more times over a 30 minute period. Each time the lights were in a different numbers and different formation. The lights lasted about 5 to 10 seconds each time they appeared and then they were gone. The size of the lights and color ( amber- orange) were unlike any we all had ever seen. The following night we saw the lights again each time amazing formations and the last time we saw them they looked as if they had split into 2 different objects. We all sat around trying to come up with ANY rational explanation for what we saw but there are none. We looked the following night but saw nothing and are all sure we will probably never see anything else like it."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"05/27/2009 09:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Oak Island","There were no other sightings in Oak Island on or around May 27th 2009"],"Case Number":"17371","Latitude":"33.916562","Country":"United States","City":"Oak Island"}
