It was moving in a W-NW direction. It seemed to be at a higher alttitude than the jet and moved in a straight path, it took about 4 seconds to be out of sight. So if you lay on your back and track your finger in a straight line and count to 4, thats how fast this was moving. There wasn't any noise or contrails or wings as I know them."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29086.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29086.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/05/2011 07:37 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/11/2011 11:10 UTC"}
