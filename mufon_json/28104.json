The lights were there breifly and then slowly faded out. I watched and the lights did not reappear at that location. Less than 30 seconds later, I saw 5-6 bright yellow lights from my location on Peach Orchard Rd. This time I was a little further down around the area of the Wells Fargo Bank. I looked down by the overpass of 520 and there were 5-6 bright yellow lights that came on (not in unison) and disappeared again. I watched again and the lights did not reappear. I turned right at Peach Orchard Rd and Windsor Spring Rd and as I was going down past the the automatic carwash I noticed another bright light right over the trees to my left hand side that appeared and disappeared. When I got home I informed my husband about what I had seen and we went out on the deck to watch the skies. We did not see anything else that nights."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Unknown","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Augusta","There were no other sightings in Augusta on or around March 1st 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.478166","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-82.00341","Tags":"City","Case Number":"28104","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","City":"Augusta","Summary":"Blinking yellow lights that disappeared","Date of the Event":"03/01/2011 08:33 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-03052011-0008","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Region":"Georgia","Date Submitted":"03/05/2011 01:17 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
