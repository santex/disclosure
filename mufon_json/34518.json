It appeared to move slowly at first which gave it the appearance pf hovering. I ran back to the house I was visiting, yelled out \"UFO\" but no one else came out to observe it. That house is about 102 ft or so from where i was at. I ran back but it seemed that it was still in the same spot but it started to move again, this time a little faster. I ran out to the front yard and observed the craft move towards the SETI compound but more to the south east of where I was standing. It started to pick up speed and shoot out between two stars part of a constellation and as I knew and expected it to do, it disappeared from sight. It was wonderful to see because I have moved and also to receive the messages they have been giving me since June of 2010 again."],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"34518","City":"Hat Creek","Date Submitted":"01/02/2012 02:46 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like","Latitude":"40.799011","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34518.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34518.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.799011,+-121.494972(34518)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34518) map </A>","Region":"California","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-121.494972","Date of the Event":"01/01/2012 06:36 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Bright Star Like Craft with Two Points","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
