{"divs":["sighting details from 2001 to 2004 i lived on the sc ind.res. nm which is 10 miles ne of los alamos nat.lab. i'm an artist and love to take pics of wonderful cloud formations, so at sunset i sat outside w my camera, looking west. 1st i saw a jet(w the usual exhaust-trail) heading from n.to w., passing thru 2 separate clouds, at about 25,000 feet. after it disappeared from view here comes another shiny object(from same direction) and it enters cloud #1, but it never came out\\passed thru the 1st cloud!! (it somehow stayed in\\behind the cloud.) and it dawned on me: there was no ex.trail accompanying it! i sat transfixed and in about 2 min. it suddenly re-appeared and sped-away much faster than it had arrived, in the same direction it had come from... sure wish i'd had a video camera instead of an slr."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-106.083561","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Santa Clara Pueblo","There were no other sightings in Santa Clara Pueblo on or around September 15th 2002"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc, Unknown","Latitude":"35.973442","Tags":"City","Case Number":"45794","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.973442,+-106.083561(45794)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45794) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"02/19/2013 07:11 UTC","Summary":"Streaking object with NO Jet Trail!!","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45794.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45794.html"],"Log Number":"US-02192013-0010","City":"Santa Clara Pueblo","Region":"New Mexico","Date of the Event":"09/15/2002 12:00 UTC"}
