Since my google research said the true galactic alignment occurred at 6:11 est I woke and walked to the beach about an hour before sunrise. There was a rainbowish colors on the horizon and I decided to take some pictures. Because it was so dark I didn't expect them to come out good and didn't really look them for over a week. When I did I found unusual light on my series of 4 pictures. Stars remain fixed and unblurred, while something else is obviously moving in a very unusual pattern."],"Latitude":"33.685307","Object Shape":"Unknown","Case Number":"45165","trends":["There have been 52 other sightings in Myrtle Beach","There were no other sightings in Myrtle Beach on or around December 21st 2012"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.685307,+-78.891114(45165)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45165) map </A>"}
