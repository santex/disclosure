{"Longitude":"-74.398981","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"28717","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was looking for landmarks near a location I wanted to drive to in Hacketstown,NJ. It is always good to do that when using Google Maps. I was in the street view magnification mode panning around the views with my mouse, and my view mistakenly went too high and showed the sky. The image I got is in the two attached screen shots. You can find this yourself just by going on Google Maps and going to the location I have showing in the photos. Then go to street view and move the cursor to look up. So what am I looking at here?"],"Region":"New Jersey","Summary":"I found what may be a UFO on Google Maps.","Latitude":"40.064744","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.064744,+-74.398981(28717)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28717) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28717.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28717_submitter_file1__Untitled1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28717_submitter_file2__Untitled2.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28717.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-04192011-0011","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in at home at my computer","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date of the Event":"04/19/2010 10:30 UTC","City":"at home at my computer","Date Submitted":"04/19/2011 11:12 UTC"}
