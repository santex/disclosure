{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"45450","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"bright moonlit night, witnessed while scanning a field with binoculars","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball","Longitude":"-75.910724","divs":["Sighting Details Watching coyotes across a field, with binoculars, saw this from quite a distance. Thought it might be an aircraft. but when parallel to directly opposite from me, I could see with my binoculars there was a trail of what appeared to be burning debris. It was not going fast enough to be thought of as a meteor or such. Distance was hard to estimate, as well as elevation. Living in a valley, it continued out of sight behind the mountains. I am sure this was seen by others, due to the skies clarity and the brilliance of the orange glow. Hopefully this was seen by others. I am sure the distance traveled would be quite extensive. best regards, Larry"],"Date of the Event":"01/27/2013 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01282013-0007","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Binghamton","There were no other sightings in Binghamton on or around January 27th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","Region":"New York","Latitude":"42.103357","Date Submitted":"01/28/2013 12:14 UTC","City":"Binghamton","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.103357,+-75.910724(45450)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45450) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45450.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45450.html"]}
