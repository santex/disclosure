I was talking on my cell phone. I always watch the sky. I live near the local airport. (small planes etc,) I notice the light coming in, because I thought that a plane was coming in on a bad approach. The light was very bright, no noise. It made a turn from SE to a E direction. I watched it until it went past the tree line. A min. or so later for jets in pattern, flew from W to E in the direction of the object."],"Date of the Event":"10/12/2012 06:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-73.079549","Object Features":"None"}
