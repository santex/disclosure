{"Summary":"Pink, elongated barrel-shape ufo spotted above my home.","Region":"Michigan","Latitude":"42.32445","divs":["sighting detailsit was about three in the afternoon, and i was walking down the sidewalk. it was a fairly cloudy day, and i was on my way home. i looked up at the sky and noticed something really out-of-the ordinary: a pink object in the sky. it's shape was that of a barrel, but stretched out. its colour was pink, and it had bright green\\red lights on the bottom of it, with was probably the most prominent feature of it. it spun, and had kind of a metal\\grey disk on its top. i had left my phone in the house, and i figured that it would have been too late if i ran to get it. so i watched the ufo as it hovered across the sky for a few minutes, and then jolted up through the clouds, leaving a small puncture in them. i was horrified by this thing, my face turned pale. i didn't know what to tell people, they would think i'm making it up. but i know what i saw."],"Object Shape":"Cylinder, Other","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"10/07/2009 03:21 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/12/2009 01:10 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19905.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19905.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-10122009-0001","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Dearborn","There were no other sightings in Dearborn on or around October 7th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.32445,+-83.167654(19905)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19905) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"00:04:02","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"19905","Longitude":"-83.167654","City":"Dearborn"}
