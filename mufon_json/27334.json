We have seen hundreds of pictures of balls of light. In the photos we have seen something that looks like a full moon on nights when their was no moon. The most interesting thing I have seen is a blue rectangle that apears to be above ground, then on the ground. Only to become a circle and return to it's rectangular shape and disappear. I have attached photos. There are five pictues in this event, but I only had room for three on this form. It is something to see when all five are shown as a slide show."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/10/2011 08:27 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"27334","City":"Six Mile","Log Number":"US-01102011-0002","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27334.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27334_submitter_file1__9182010025.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27334_submitter_file2__9182010026.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/27334_submitter_file3__9182010028.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27334.html"],"Region":"South Carolina"}
