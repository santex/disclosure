{"Summary":"Two arcs of flashing lwhite and red lights leaping about the night sky over Aldermaston, UK","City":"Aldermaston","Object Shape":"Other","Country":"United Kingdom","Case Number":"13812","divs":["Sighting DetailsTwo arcs of flashing red and white lights, each about the size of the end of a thumb nail held at arm's length, viewed for about five minutes in the no-fly zone above Aldermaston - the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) - at 7.30 pm last evening. The sky was black, cold and very clear, full of stars and with many planes flying to and from Heathrow Airport, about 40 miles away. Seen through binoculars, the arcs appeared to be flying at about the height of a commercial plane, and showed as fast flashes of red and white lights. They zipped about the sky, moving randomly up or down, right or left, with each change of direction crossing some hundreds of feet of sky in the blink of an eye. After five minutes of these erratic manoeuvres, they faded from sight."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/18/2008 07:45 UTC","Longitude":"-1.14552","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Aldermaston","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Latitude":"51.372897","Date of the Event":"11/18/2008 07:45 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13812.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13812.html"],"Region":"England","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.372897,+-1.14552(13812)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13812) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"GB-11192008-0003"}
