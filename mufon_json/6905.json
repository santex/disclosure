{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Detailshelicoptor sounds, like many. thunderous. bright light in back window. was sleeping on a cot with my two children,9 months and about three at the time. thought was an escaped prisoner from the prison 30 min. away. went back to sleep but light was persistant. i screamed out what do you want? strange sensation of well being and heard a voice say they were not going to hurt us and to not be afraid. had not a clue what was going on. paced a few times back and forth. saw my son looking up into the light at the window. screamed for him to move away. i was confused and did not know what to do. my first instinct was to run several acres over to the home down the way. i moved to the window again, becasue helicopter noise stopped and nothing. suddenly like a water cutain, the sky peeled back, and chris and i saw the most incredible sight ever. a circular object hovering in the back. it was beautiful. my son and i stared at it and felt at peace. someone started to tun lights on. one ring of lights lighted up after another until the entire inderneath was lighted up in cicular patter. this was done without noise and it was quiet. suddenly we became very tired, and fell on the cot and went into a deep sleep. later, found myself being carried out of the home, could not move ffom the neck down. worried about my children. kept lifting up my neck. a normal males voice on the left side of me told me nicely not to fight, just lay down. i was powerless. i realized this and laid my head down and it was on the shoulder of someone to the left, same voice. he said that's it, just go back top sleep. i woke up again and looked up to see i was being carried down a hall where light clinged to the ceiling with no fixture or source. the hall was long and i could tell slightly curved. i looked to the side and wanted to scream, i saw something,but i was horrified, i was unable to make a sound, i was in shock. they became irritated ina nice way and asked me to try and withstand the reality i guess. i could not and so something came from his hand and shot into my arm like a pressurized type instrument for injection. i was out again. later i awoke and i was horrified, the standard creatures that have been spoken about. first set were not as white and seemed to act as techs. standard medical procedure, but later i found myself having a discussion with a white one as though i were telling life events and very upset and complaining. i knew them, then my state of mind seemed to shift and i was wondering were i was and what was happening, i was going into shock again. the white one seemed to have more authority. he wanted me to lay back and wanted to do something with my eye. i was begging please dont hurt me and where were my children. he told me i had some kind of status that i would not like to mention at this time. i was surprised. he told me they wanted to make sure i was okay. later i found out that i had eye laser surgery that was not around yet. later i had to get my retina redone and it was years later when they just got laser surgery out. the next morning we awoke, chris and i had nose bleeds, and a barrel with tiny dimples on it fell out of my nose. there is more to this story. i interacted with a large or very tall being. the being glowed all around his body. he told me we had not seen each other in a very long time. i was horrifed and in awe of the structure of the being. there was a relationship, at that time i had woken up in a dark room on a black extended tech couch of some kind. there were white rose petals that fell from my hair as i lifted myself up. i was very confused, and then terrified went the being entered into the room. he had eyes without pupils, and deep type of blue undescribable. he was over seven feet or more tall. there is so much more, and i have not made this public except to talk to one group a long time ago during college. later, the next day my husband and i saw a circular burn mark on the ground out back and like three shovels went into the ground and lifted the dirt perfectly out as they were removed. i did not even know the work ufo then or understand anything about what had happened and had not read any material at all. i was left thinking i had seen a full moon. i never understood the full extent of what had occured until years later. many unusual things had and have occured over time and when i look back at my life. i have lived all over the world, and later realized that i had unsual incidences. one very specific one happened in australia when i lived there during my youth. another occured in algeria when i lived there also. you may choose to leave this alone or speak to me, i do not care. i know what happened and it really changed many things about the way i looked at life. i continued on and went to college and raised my children. i put everthing on the back burner and chose to live life, because i could never find solid answers. maybe you have collective information that can help, i do not know. you decide. my peace to you. time this happened: around easter of 1990"],"Object Flight
