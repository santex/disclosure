{"Latitude":"38.80488","Summary":"bullet like object flying at high altitude leaving trail and then disapearing","divs":["Sighting Detailsobject appear to be in reentry leaving a large trail at a high speed very meteor like. i almost thought it was a missle but it was coming downwards very fast, also a fuel tank or even a space shuttle.the part that surprised me the most was that all the sudden as if it had reached a certain point the trail stopped and i could see a dim shinny object come out of it and stand somewhat still, i was traveling down the i-15 at 80mph so it was hard to judge the speed but it dissapeared after that.i assumed that the object had burned in space but to see something that resemble a spacecraft come out of that cloud and move like a craft really got my heart pumping! blessings rob"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Nevada","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Case Number":"8344","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in unknown","There were no other sightings in unknown on or around November 12th 2007"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/12/2007 03:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.80488,+-116.411229(8344)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8344) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8344.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8344.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-116.411229","Log Number":"US-11132007-0008","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Flash","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/12/2007 03:30 UTC"}
