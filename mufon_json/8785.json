The light emitted (not blinking) was white, blue and red and it slowly rose from the top of the mountain and continued to climb slowly to a higher elevation. I used binoculars and saw a small light hovering in one area then moving slowly to a higher elevation. I took a video with a sony digital camera but was unable to view the object thru the display screen so I only got it on the very end of this video. the camera was moving not the object. The last frame shows the object on top with a small star below it."],"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01052008-0002","Region":"North Carolina","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/04/2008 08:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"light hovering over mountain for approx 1 1/2 hours","Date of the Event":"01/04/2008 08:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.604245,+-82.550025(8785)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8785) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path"}
