{"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","divs":["sighting detailsi was a cloudy overcast morning and i had taken my kids to the bus stop after the bus picked them up and left i looked over to the west i noticed that there was a perfect round circle in the clouds exposing the sky a little unusal i thought so i kept looking but i must had blinked cause when i looked back the cloud was now shaped like a triangle with a white triangle inside of it and i noticed that the bottom tip of the triangle was black and that there were black wavey lines on it that went half way up the craft and half way across, and it seemed to me that this triangle was built to camflouge itself within the clouds, i must had observed it for about 5 minutes, then i blinked again and saw that it was gone but up a little higher was another shaped of a triangle in the clouds but through the triangle i could see the blue sky. i really did not know what it was at the time and i wondered if it was a sign of some kind of a sign and it took me just a little time to realize that i had just had a close encounter, i was on highway 101 where its a 2 lane highway i was on the east side of the hwy and the triangle was on the west side of the hwy give ir take i'll say about 80 yards from me.it was quiet and it made no sound that i could hear. the circle that i had seen was a perfect round circle and the triangle's were perfectly shaped also and i know what i seen and no one can ever conveince me that it was something other than a ufo! i also became a mufon member because of this. funny thing is i can't really remember seening anything before the circle until i ask -- which direction did it come from? then i can see it clearly further away and it looked so small and like i was viewing it far away through a tunnel of clouds. i must had dismissed the triangle when i seen it far from me at first because it did not look real at that point or it looked like something from a cartoon from that distance i thought. after my sighting, i thought surely i could'nt be the only one seeing circles and traingles i kept looking for a sighting like mine and i found one, here is a link if you want to look http:\\\\www.ufocasebook.com\\090108.html i did make a drawing of it but am unable to send it at this time. i have shown it to mufon investgators. it has been over four months now and i still think about it every day."],"Region":"California","Date Submitted":"05/20/2008 08:20 UTC","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Leggett","There were no other sightings in Leggett on or around May 20th 2008"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.873844,+-123.713378(12729)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12729) map </A>","Summary":"White Traingle with circle","Case Number":"12729","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Log Number":"US-09222008-0024","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Fog, Medium","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","City":"Leggett","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12729.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12729.html"],"Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Date of the Event":"05/20/2008 08:20 UTC","Longitude":"-123.713378","Latitude":"39.873844"}
