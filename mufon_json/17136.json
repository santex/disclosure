So as I am into planes I look out of my window and look out.. Waiting and waiting this VERY SLOW triangular object is flying out side of my house toward I think west or north. The object was not well seen, but it had Four Lights. One Red that flashed and three white that I think flashed. Then I saw it tilt alot towards the right and then the left... I was pretty shocked and not scared when I saw it. I lost its visual when it went behind a house and I was not able to see it after. My brother who lives with me heard it but did not see it. I am not sure if anyone else saw it."],"Date of the Event":"05/24/2009 09:56 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Features":"None","City":"Meriden","Object Flight Path":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Meriden","There were no other sightings in Meriden on or around May 24th 2009"],"Country":"United States","Case Number":"17136","Object Shape":"Triangle","Date Submitted":"05/24/2009 09:56 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.542794,+-72.801144(17136)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17136) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17136.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17136.html"],"Longitude":"-72.801144"}
