The object in question did not conform to any of these rules and was not what I would call \"of normal aircraft appearance\" there was one solid light that pulsated but never vanished and it changed colour from BLUE to WHITE to YELLOW to ORANGE to RED, then the sequence of colours would start over in the same order never flashing but simply melding into the next The object had a fluent movement and did not fluctuate in height while visible, my view of it was not impeded in any way, there was a slight shimmering of the light but that was possibly caused by the chimneys present between me and it, after the minute and 20 seconds it disappeared behind a line of trees and I did not see it again I stayed at the window for more than ten minutes while I was on the phone trying to reach anyone in the know at Luton Airport the object did not return but I did see a couple more planes leaving Luton Airport, without the lights on the wings the headlights of these planes would be compareable in brightness to that of the object I saw I am of sound mind and judgement had not been drinking and do not do drugs and I know what I saw was out of the ordinary"],"Latitude":"51.517929","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"00:01:20","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around March 7th 2010"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22195.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22195.html"],"Case Number":"22195","Date Submitted":"03/07/2010 03:36 UTC"}
