They thought it was a plane making an emergency landing so they turned around and headed towards the park and ride expecting to see it there and about to call 911 but it was gone. They continued down the road but still didn't see it. They turned around before Jerry Dove Dr. and headed back. Right before the park and ride my youngest son told my oldest \"look to your right!\" It seems it was hovering above a trailer. It tilted and then left at a high rate of speed. It was described as silver in color with large lights, looking like two pie plates together. The lights were bright but didn't illuminate the surrounding area kinda like a glow stick. It also made no noise at all. It is unknown what was seen that night."],"Object Shape":"Disc","Region":"West Virginia","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.289639,+-80.251738(46168)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46168) map </A>","Case Number":"46168","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"North central wv ufo sighting","Latitude":"39.289639","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46168.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46168.html"],"Longitude":"-80.251738","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"03/13/2013 01:04 UTC","Log Number":"US-03132013-0004","City":"Bridgeport"}
