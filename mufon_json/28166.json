{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWent out to observe the flyover of the International Space Station. It was due to come by at 7:24pm along with the space shuttle over Scranton, PA. My wife, daughter, and I saw 2 circular, somewhat bright,starlike objets moving at an insane rate of speed, appearing to chase each other while traveling. We assumed it was the Space Station, checked the time, and it was 7:21pm. After pondering this for a few seconds, I realized that it couldn't have been the Space Station or Shuttle, because of the high rate of speed. We then saw the Station & Shuttle fly over more to the southwest at 7:24pm and at nowhere near the same rate of speed as the first objects. Thank You!"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28166.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28166.html"],"Log Number":"US-03082011-0012","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"28166","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"41.412769","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Scranton","There were no other sightings in Scranton on or around March 8th 2011"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Date Submitted":"03/08/2011 09:44 UTC","City":"Scranton","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-75.657412","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.412769,+-75.657412(28166)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28166) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"2 circular starlike objects chasing each other","Date of the Event":"03/08/2011 07:22 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
