{"divs":["sighting detailsit was a summer night in 1979. my girlfriend and i were sitting on the balcony of her second-floor garden apartment in cranbury, nj, which overlooked a large open field, at the far edge of which was a wooded area, perhaps 150 yards or so away. it was late in the evening; perhaps around midnight or shortly thereafter. we were just hanging out, doing some stargazing. then, i noticed something ���������funny��������� ��������� something odd going on in my peripheral vision that drew me to look over to the left portion of my field of vision. some of the ���������stars��������� were moving. perhaps 25 ��������� 30 degrees above the horizon, above the wooded area at the far left end of the field, was a loose cluster of perhaps 6 to 8 lights that were meandering about in the sky, randomly, aimlessly, independently of each other ��������� moving in something approximating ���������brownian motion.��������� they were a tad larger than the stars ��������� around the size of planets, and like the planets, they didn���������t twinkle; they shone with a bright, even, constant white light. but unlike planets, they were moving about ��������� meandering about, actually. i pointed this out to my girlfriend, and we both sat there watching this phenomenon for maybe 2 minutes, dumbfounded. then, something even more curious happened. all of a sudden, the lights stopped meandering about, and collectively began migrating toward a central point. they settled into a perfectly circular formation, and remained motionless in this configuration for perhaps a minute or so. i counted 8 lights, and they were located at the 8 points of a compass in this motionless circular formation. again, the circular formation of lights was around 25 ��������� 30 degrees above the horizon, at the left side of the wooded area at the far end of the field. my girlfriend and i just sat there, awestruck at what we were looking at. then, something stunning happened. suddenly, in an instant, all 8 of these lights suddenly took off radially, away from the center, away from each other, like spokes of a wheel, and shot over the entire distance from the original formation to the distant horizons in probably one second or less, and disappeared from view. they didn���������t accelerate ��������� they went from 0 to probably thousands of miles per hour instantaneously. this absolutely terrified both my girlfriend and me. we jumped up, said something like ���������oh, [cms\\tg\\pd]��������� or ���������oh, my god!��������� and ran into the apartment and locked the patio door. for maybe a half an hour, all we could do was jump around and yell ���������oh my god, what the hell was that??!!!��������� that is when i knew ��������� absolutely ��������� that we are not alone."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cranbury","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"UFO sighting - 1979 - Cranbury, NJ - Circular Formation","Log Number":"US-08282009-0007","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Cranbury","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.307222,+-74.516389(18926)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18926) map </A>","Object Shape":"Circle, Other","Longitude":"-74.516389","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18926.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18926.html"],"Latitude":"40.307222","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"New Jersey","Country":"United States","Case Number":"18926","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"07/31/1979 01:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/31/1979 01:00 UTC","Object Features":"None"}
