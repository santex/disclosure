They appeared to be stars, but didn���t behave like any stars I have seen. They are visible at night, during the day, and currently visible right now as of 14JUL12. I first took notice when I was looked up at the stars and was tracking what I thought was a satellite because it was moving fairly quickly through the sky. It changed directions, stopped, and the shot across the sky like a shooting star! I said to myself, \" I must be going crazy because no way in hell that just happened right before my eyes\". So I went inside to forget about what I say, but moments later I felt compelled to go back outside (like my mind was telling me to go back and look up), so I did. I noticed not one, but at least 6 objects during week 1. Some were off doing their own thing while others grouped up and paired up forming shapes like diamonds, squares, v-patterns, and circles right in front of my eyes. They often separated going on what appears to be predetermined flight patterns after forming a shape. At times, they would pair up and chase another object. Another thing I noticed is that when a single object approaches another object, they both start circling one another in an s-pattern, and then one would follow the other. Week 2, the numbers doubled and then tripled. Currently there are hundreds of these objects. Some core details I observed comprises these objects outshined the sun and are even visible through the clouds (at night and during the day). Today, they appear to be flying around in a predetermined flight route as they make a large grid. They move slowly then progressively speed up leaving a tail like a comet. They also stop and then shoot across the sky like a shooting star then stop on a dime. From what I can make out, they have a preset vicinity for which they are staying in. Naturally I began filtering through possible explanation as to what these objects may be. My first thought was they may be satellites, but due to their intelligent and elegant maneuverability and flight patterns, I quickly dismissed this idea. Another idea I explored, they may be some new kind of aircraft, but based on my observations and the fact these objects are extremely far away (I say low orbit) and computing the speed and maneuvers this object were displaying, our anatomy as human beings does not permit such a thing. I dismissed this idea extremely quickly. Another thought that crossed my mind, perhaps they are meteors or some other type of similar object, but based on how intelligent, and apparent predetermined flight patterns and such, I had to throw this last idea out. I never seen a meteor shoot across the sky, stop, move at various different speeds, change directions in a uniformed fashion or in sharp turns, group with one or more other meteorites, etcetera��� I had to dismiss this idea. Update (I begin typing this yesterday 14JUL15): Today (15JUL12), one object descended enough that I can honestly say it was long disc shaped. This object was shinning and reflecting the sun light (if that makes sense) at the same time. To be more accurate, the bottom of this object shinned like a star (like it was emitting or generating light) while the top of this object reflected light. I know the sun light was reflecting off of this object because you can visibly see the light move across the object as it propelled. It appeared to have a dark area located approximately near the rear of the object. I tracked this object as it made it's way through the blue sky over my home, but it progressively sped up and ultimately ascended so fast i dropped my drink I had in my hand. I noticed approximately three other objects converging on this one before this event occurred. Furthermore, there was no sound from this object nor was there visible \"exhaust\" or fumes coming from this object. In my honest assessment, i think these objects are fighting one another. My friend and I noticed 2 objects chasing each other, and then a bright light, and then nothing... only one object remained. Why is that significant is because in my observations, these objects DO NOT disappear. They may become brighter (descend) or become dimmer (ascend), but they are always visible."],"Case Number":"40837","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40837.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40837.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/26/2012 01:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
