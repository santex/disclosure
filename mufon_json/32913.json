{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"32913","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at a friends house in Plainview Tx. I was outside having a smoke, when I noticed an object moving East just to the north of me. The object could not have been more than 15,000 feet up. It had 3 very bright lights amber in color but no strobes like an airplane or helo which caught my attention. The object made no sound what so ever. I could not make out the shape of object even though it was a clear night. The object moved in a straight line never changing direction or altitude and kept a steady speed slower than a commercial jet. I watched the object for approximately 5 minutes till it went out of sight over other houses. I was in shock cause I have never seen a UFO before. I'm still trouble by what I saw. Since that sighting I have had another approx a month or two later at approx the same time in a different city 50 miles south of Plainview. I'm at a loss for what I have seen. Even scared at times, and watch the skies constantly."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32913.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32913.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.184794,+-101.706842(32913)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32913) map </A>","Summary":"It was moving West to East , making no noise, no strobe lights.","Date of the Event":"09/10/2010 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-10272011-0011","Object Shape":"Unknown","Latitude":"34.184794","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-101.706842","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Plainview","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Plainview","Date Submitted":"10/27/2011 10:20 UTC","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unknown"}
