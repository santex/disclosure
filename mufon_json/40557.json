After it formed a silver object appeared. I watched while this object started to move away from the cloud and start to move back and forth and then it hovered. I realized this was not an airplane so i went and grabbed my binoculars and zoomed in on it. The object was saucer shaped and the sun was gleaming off it. after awhile the object moved back in the cloud and the cloud vanished along with the object. I tried to get the sighting recorded but was unable to see the object. I have had many sightings over my life time and have learned to take notes.I was a witness to the '97 phoenix sighting while a truck driver. That object passed over me and i swear it was at least a mile wide. The object i saw today could only be seen with sunglasses."],"City":"Houston","Log Number":"US-07072012-0127","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Summary":"around 1:30pm i noticed a cloud forming then a silver object emerged.
