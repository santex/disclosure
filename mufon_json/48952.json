{"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were on the back porch just talking, then we saw an object moving West to East. Then 3 minutes later saw another moving South to North. Then 2 minutes later, saw a UFO moving North South then disappeared. We were just looking at the stars then I noticed something moving. I thought it was the Space Station. The objects' looked just like stars moving really really fast. One was following an airplane. We all were shocked to see all these UFO's. All of us agreed that we saw more UFO's tonight than in our entire lives. As of 10:35 we are still seeing these objects."],"Date Submitted":"07/14/2013 10:36 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.371169,+-81.096192(48952)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48952) map </A>","Case Number":"48952","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48952.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48952.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Princeton","There were no other sightings in Princeton on or around July 14th 2013"],"Longitude":"-81.096192","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/14/2013 10:01 UTC","Region":"West Virginia","Summary":"Starting at 10 pm Me, and four others say 7 UFO's We are not sure all of them are UFO's.
