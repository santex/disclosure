I was driving on my way to work on the morning of Tuesday January 27, 2009. I was driving southbound on route 93 around the border of New Hampshire and Massachusetts. It was still a bit dark with a bit of a sunrise. When driving this morning, I notice, what I thought was an airplane just beneath the clouds. What captured my attention was that the aircraft appear to be falling from the sky. I said to myself \" my god! an airplane is falling!\" The problem here was the object dropped vertically with control, defying gravity. This is when it was clear to me to be a UFO. This object then climbed back up vertically, then traveled up in a 45��� angle and flew out of the sky at a enormous rate of speed. At this point I asked myself. \"what did I just see?\" For me there is no other explanation.....I witnessed a UFO! The object was a bright round glowing circle and was floating in the sky like a balloon (kinda like a light bulb in the sky). I was thrown back by the technology, this was not from this planet. I wasn't afraid, if anything I was amazed and impressed. I really hope to see this again someday. I don't have any videos or pics , the event lasted for about 7-10 seconds. If you have any questions you would like to ask, please feel free. Thanks."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","City":"Salem","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.796315,+-71.21515(15174)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15174) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01282009-0012","Region":"New Hampshire"}
