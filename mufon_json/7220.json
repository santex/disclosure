It seemed as if the remainder of the circle was behind the foothills of the mainland. The red lights were blinking in a seemingly random pattern. The lights did not move. The area is jungle and i have never seen any light there before. I watched for about half an hour and when I checked again an hour later they were gone. My wife and i observed the lights with binoculars set on our porch railing. The clarity and the strength of the light was atypical of home or vehicle lighting and the scale of the separation of the lights suggests a large area perhaps several hundred feet. The brightness and clarity of the lights was what first attracted my attention. There was no noise."],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bocas del Toro","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/11/2007 08:18 UTC","Latitude":"9.335882","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7220.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7220.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Bocas del Toro"}
