It was triangular in shape, had lights. It was accompanied by a sphere of light which bounced around it. They all took off quickly. The triangular object was about 80 ft off the ground and was about 40 ft wide. Casey made pictures of these objects. I believe he said they were pursued by jets. We live close to the Willow Grove Naval Air Base. I know Casey was telling the truth as he saw it, and the friends can confirm it. He tried to take pictures with his camera phone, but they didn't come out. I'm sure he would not mind telling you what he saw in more detail. Thanks for all you do.
