It was making no noise, level, about 2000' up, had two side by side rings of colored lights that rotated blinking. Level flight, observed until it went out of sight. Close enough I could tell it was not an airplane I had ever seen. No wings, tail section or cockpit. Just more oval but had sort of sculpted out on either side. Looked more like a stingray type body. The lights were large circles. From my view, probably about the size of a child's aspirin. Was going very, very slow. Not nearly enough speed to keep an airplane up. that's about it."],"City":"Forney","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Texas","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Forney","There were no other sightings in Forney on or around July 26th 2012"],"Summary":"Shaped more like a stingray, two sets of circular lights, different colors, blinking","Longitude":"-96.445249"}
