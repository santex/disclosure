{"Object Features":"Louvres","Weather Factors":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsObject appeared about a half mile away, had sun-bright light underneath, notches around the periphery, silent. It appeared about 5 degrees wide, so at a half mile that would make it something like 210' in diameter. All of this is subjective based on my interpretation of its distance. What I have attached is not a picture, but a creation I made which looks exactly like the real object---I didn't have my camera and in the ten seconds or so it took to get it out, the object disappeared. I took a pic of where it was and created the image I saw in that picture. Read my report attached to the file attached to this report. I'll always regret not having the camera to hand, but standing at the road side taking a whiz, I didn't."],"Disposition":"Hoax","Latitude":"34.239668","Date of the Event":"04/16/2005 12:41 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-111.317036","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Payson","There were no other sightings in Payson on or around April 16th 2005","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Oval - like a balloon, silver, had a bright light underneath about a quarter as bright as the sun.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.239668,+-111.317036(25337)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25337) map </A>","Object Shape":"Blimp","City":"Payson","Date Submitted":"09/08/2010 12:53 UTC","Case Number":"25337","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-09082010-0001","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25337.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25337.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change"}
