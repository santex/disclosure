{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAfter living next door for 5 years I decided to get a bigger apartment, as where I live now for 19 years. When I first moved in here I was putting things away. When I sat in a chair in my living room I looked out of my window. From outer space an object stopped about 150 yards from my upstaires apartment. It looked like a ball with a stick coming from the center of the ball. The object made very fast pendulum movments, as the stick part was up. The ball had violet, orange, pink and blue colors where the stick had more colors. The ball and the stick spun very quickly in opposite directions. In 3 seconds the object flung out, and disappeared into outer space. The ball part was about 5 feet in diameter, and the stick part was about 6 feet long and 2 inches thick. I saw this object when I was hot and tired from working in my apartment. I by no means think this was the cause of the sighting, to say I was seeing things. Thank you."],"Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9777.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9777.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/30/1988 01:10 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9777","trends":[],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-119.414382","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-02282008-0037","Region":"California","Latitude":"36.784981","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Other","Summary":"A very unusual aircraft outside of my window.","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"11/30/1988 01:10 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.784981,+-119.414382(9777)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9777) map </A>"}
