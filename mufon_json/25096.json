{"divs":["Sighting Detailsi was driving to pick up my room mate from work. i was on country club road heading east. in the sky almost directly east there was a bright light in the sky. having lived in roswell most of my life i am quite familiar with various types of air traffic and something about it struck me as odd. as i observed it i noticed it began to wobble. i watched it as well as i could (safely, given i was driving 45 mph) and something blue shot out of the direction of the object. it is still in the sky east of roswell right now at 11:28 local time. the blue ejection was sort of cone shaped, but looked like a series of circles that got larger towards the bottom... kind of like a snowman for lack of a better description. there were about 8-12 circles. this is a serious statement, not a joke or anything. thank you for your time."],"Object Shape":"Star-like, Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/14/2010 10:40 UTC","trends":["There have been 38 other sightings in Roswell","There were no other sightings in Roswell on or around August 14th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Summary":"Bright white object with blue ejection.","Longitude":"-104.516084","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.398236,+-104.516084(25096)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25096) map </A>","City":"Roswell","Region":"New Mexico","Latitude":"33.398236","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/15/2010 01:31 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25096.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25096.html"],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08152010-0001","Case Number":"25096"}
