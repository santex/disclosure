Clear skies perfect weather. Approx 1am my brother called to me begging me to come check out this ufo. I was fixated on the music I was working on and didn't pay much attention. He soon gave up and rejoined me. Approx an hour and a half later I went outside to urinate. I looked up to see this orb tracking backwards and forwards and sort of floating and sometimes making decisive sharp monuvers. My brother and I watch this for hours till sun came up. It made us both feel very unusual. We have had many sightings but have seen nothing for quite sometime now"],"Longitude":"-3.702162","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=55.897742,+-3.702162(47756)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47756) map </A>","Latitude":"55.897742","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Armadale","Region":"Scotland"}
