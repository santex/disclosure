We watched it for three to five minutes as it moved across the sky in a straight unwavering path. A second red object came into view and we looked at it through binoculars. This was moving in a south to west direction in a straight path, and it had blue flames on the back of it. It looked like it had a tail. It would take a dime held at arm's length to cover it. We watched this one for several minutes and it just got smaller and farther away until we couldn't see it any more. We watched the skies for 30 minutes after that and did not see any aircraft or other objects. We have lived around KCI airport for a long time and have never seen anything like this. It did not behave like a plane, helicopter, satellite, or ISS."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 3 other sightings in Kansas City on or around July 4th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/08/2011 11:29 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"39.101396","City":"Kansas City","Log Number":"US-07082011-0005","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30058.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30058.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown"}
