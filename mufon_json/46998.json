{"divs":["sighting details4-25-2013 i stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and noticed a red\\orange light in the north east sky just above the tree tops. at first i thought it was airplane lights then realized there were no white lights and the light was not blinking. i thought maybe it was a drone since dobbins air force base is in the direction it came from but drones make noise. i ran inside to grab my binoculars and got a clear view of it. all i can type is, wow. as it continued south west the light just faded away. an oval shape with a matte like exterior that reflected the red\\orange just a little. the light underneath was at the front of the of it. the flight path was straight and steady. it took about one or two minutes to travel from where i first saw it till the light faded out . . . no sound at all."],"Summary":"A red/orange light over tree tops heading SW, no sound, oval shaped . . wow","Object Features":"None","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Georgia","City":"Powder Springs","Latitude":"33.872539","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Powder Springs","There were no other sightings in Powder Springs on or around April 25th 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"04/26/2013 09:05 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"46998","Log Number":"US-04262013-0009","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Oval","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.872539,+-84.648821(46998)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46998) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46998.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46998.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/25/2013 09:15 UTC","Longitude":"-84.648821","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
