One person in the car said \"I see a UFO!\" I looked out the window and saw four bright lights coming toward us. I didn't really mistake it for anything at first, i just thought it was a UFO. It was about 150 feet above the treeline and quickly bearing down on us, but seemed to be going a lot slower than it actually was. As it passed over us without a sound, I could make out a boomerang shape wider than the wingspan of a jumbo jet. Two of the lights were on each wingtips and the other two situated closer to the front. After the thing went over us, we were too spooked to look at it again."],"City":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.764673,+-79.01795(20327)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20327) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11052009-0009","Longitude":"-79.01795","Date Submitted":"11/05/2009 07:27 UTC","Summary":"boomerang/wing-shape with four bright lights. completely quiet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20327.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20327.html"],"Latitude":"35.764673","Sighting Duration":"00:00:20","Object Shape":"Teardrop","Disposition":"Hoax","Region":"North Carolina","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
