At first we thought the object was a low flying airplane. We noticed that the size was unusual and thought it might be the space station. There was no airplane noise. It was quiet, except for the light breezes. No other noises were witnessed. It moved relativly fast, slight twitching left to right in movement, still moving southeaterly until it faded to a pinprick and then suddenly disappeared. It had still been travelling in the southeaterly direction. There was a satellite higher up, but yet intersecting the larger white object. The small satellite looked, in comparision, like a slower moving pinpoint heading north."],"Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-119.249795","Date of the Event":"06/05/2008 10:04 UTC","Log Number":"US-06062008-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Fernley","Summary":"Bright White light moving rapidly Southeast"}
