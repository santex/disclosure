My friend and I were talking and notice a dark in color, bright red light hovering the lake. It was off in the distance so it was hard to see any real shape besides a sphere shape to it. So, It was hovering then begain to slowly move westward. Guessing maybe a quarter of a mile. It stopped and hovered for a small amout of time. It then very quickly, shot staight up, about four inches from where we were standing. Then hovered very briefly, a second maybe and darted off to the east with a tail, in a forty five degree angle and just kinda desovled, vanished. I'm a fan of planes and helicopters and I've never seen anything move like that. I was in awh. Since that moment, I find it hard to believe that our planet is the only one with life in the billion of stars that are out there."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46902.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46902.html"],"Case Number":"46902","Region":"Wisconsin","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/22/2013 12:50 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/14/1985 10:00 UTC","City":"Ashland","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Ashland","There were no other sightings in Ashland on or around August 14th 1985"]}
