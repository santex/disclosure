THE ONE ON THE RIGHT WAS TROWING LITTLE RED BALLS ( ABOUT A DOZEN) IN THE FIELD BELOW. ALL THIS WAS FOR AN HOUR AND THEN SOON AS DAYLIGHT STARTED TO BREAK THE LIGHT ON THE FARTEST RIGHT THAT WAS THROWING THOSE RED BALLS STARTED TO COME TOWARDS MY HOUSE AT ABOUT 20 TO 25 MILES PER HOUR, VERY SLOW, I RAN OUTSIDE TO SEE THAT AND SAW IT MOVING TOWARD ME. I RAN INSIDE THE HOUSE AND GOT MY CAMERA AND BY THAT TIME IT WAS BESIDE MY ROOFTOP, IT'S BOTTOM ALMOST TOUCHED MY ROOF. TOKE A PICTURE AND THE FLASH POPPED UP. I RAN BESIDE MY WALL AND I SAW THE DIAMOND SHAPE AND THE COLORS. AS THE LIGHT MOVED ALONG TOWARDS THE SUNRISE I TOOK A SECOND PICTURE THAT I HAVE SAVED. THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN AT 25 TO 30 FEET ABOVE GROUND AND ALL YOU SEE IS A LITTLE SPECK WITH 3 DIFFERENT LIGHTS LIKE A PICTURE OF SOMETHING 3 MILES AWAY."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30480.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30480_submitter_file1__015.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30480.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"3 BRIGHT LIGHTS AS SNOW","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/06/2011 06:09 UTC","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Abingdon","There were no other sightings in Abingdon on or around December 24th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"36.656577","Object Shape":"Diamond","Region":"Virginia","Longitude":"-82.110821","City":"Abingdon","Case Number":"30480","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.656577,+-82.110821(30480)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30480) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
