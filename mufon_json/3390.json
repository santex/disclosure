{"divs":["Sighting DetailsSighting Report: It was approximately 7.10pm on Thursday, June 16, 2005 just as a bad storm was subsiding. I was out on my porch smoking when I noticed a black object very, very slowly moving across the sky. There is usually air traffic in the vicinity as Westchester county NY has a small airport a few miles away but this object did not act like an aircraft. It was not at great altitude as the storm cloud cover was quite low, in fact on occasion the clouds passed across the object. I continued to observe, it regularly appeared to change shape from circular to cigar but as it came closer, I realised it was pitching & yawing. The object did not seem very large to me, smaller than say a light aircraft. I had to dismiss this object as perhaps a balloon, kite or similar as the object was moving into the wind. After perhaps 7-10 minutes of viewing, the cloud cover was too great to see the object any longer & I went back inside."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.05343,+-73.538734(3390)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3390) map </A>","Summary":"Not Provided","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3390.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3390.html"],"Log Number":"","Latitude":"41.05343","Date of the Event":"06/17/2005 03:03 UTC","Case Number":"3390","Region":"Connecticut","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Cigar, Sphere","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Stamford","There were no other sightings in Stamford on or around June 17th 2005"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Stamford","Longitude":"-73.538734","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/17/2005 03:03 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
