{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWitnessed by my room mate. She stated it's ok to report it and she would talk to you. At approx. 9:30pm, on September 12th, 2013, she was standing out side in the driveway talking on her phone. She said she looked up at the stars and saw a bright star begin to sparkle then it exploded. A few minutes later, she saw another bright star start to sparkle and she took a picture with her phone and caught it right when it exploded. When they disintegrated, light projected from both sides. When she first told me about this, I thought she might have seen a supernova. When she said it happened the second time a few minutes later, I thought it should be reported to you. She texted me the photo and I have texted it to my e-mail. Looking at the photo, it looks like a cloud around the actual explosion or disintegration. When I am home I can e-mail it to you or I can text it to you at any time."],"Region":"Florida","City":"St. Augustine","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-81.313715","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09162013-0001","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in St. Augustine","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50846.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50846.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.821117,+-81.313715(50846)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50846) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/16/2013 02:07 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/12/2013 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"29.821117","Summary":"starlike started sparking then exploded-took about 10 seconds","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"50846"}
