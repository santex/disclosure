Grouped together, but still moving around independent of each other. By the time I found a place to pull over, all but 3 of the lights had disappeared someplace, and my cam sucks, and it was 10:30 at night, so this video is pretty sh*tty, but right around 2:50ish, I zoom out and you can see a couple of the lights together. It was eerie as shit to see in person.
