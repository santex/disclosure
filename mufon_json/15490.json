{"Summary":"Brilliant bright turquoise blue flash in a foggy, damp, low visibility sky.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approx 7:30pm while sitting on my front porch I witnessed the most beautiful color appear in a southern sky. It covered the width of three streets and was roughly rectangular in shape and coverage of the sky. It was a bright turquoise in its center with darker vivid blue and green at its edges and lasted for approx. 2 seconds. There was a plane approaching at the time which veered off to the left of this illuminated area of sky. I thought I was seeing things, called to my son and waited for a reappearance which did not occur. I then googled what I had witnessed and found similar stories of recent sightings. It was truly breathtaking, I hope an explanation can be provided for what I was lucky enough to have witnessed."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-02142009-0009","Weather Factors":"Fog, Medium","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"New Jersey","Date Submitted":"02/14/2009 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash","Case Number":"15490","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Longitude":"-74.163297","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Newark","There were no other sightings in Newark on or around February 14th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.744197,+-74.163297(15490)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15490) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15490.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15490.html"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"40.744197","Date of the Event":"02/14/2009 07:30 UTC","City":"Newark"}
