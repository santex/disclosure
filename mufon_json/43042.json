{"Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving home from town we were driving south when I noticed 3 bright lights with a red light in the center. My first guess was it was just a plane because it was in the area of an airport. I then noticed that the lights were way way brighter than most airplanes in the air around here. It descended towards the tree tops but then began to absent again. Maybe it was just an air plane but with its strange behavior I am sure it isnt an ordinary plane. The \"plane\" headed east towards Lansing."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.932248","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.932248,+-83.625532(43042)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43042) map </A>","Region":"Michigan","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"10/05/2012 02:06 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/04/2012 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10052012-0009","City":"Grand Blanc","Summary":"{dr}Triangle lights headed East","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"43042","Object Shape":"Triangle","Longitude":"-83.625532","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43042.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43042.html"],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Grand Blanc","There were no other sightings in Grand Blanc on or around October 4th 2012"]}
