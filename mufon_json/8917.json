I could see a bright white light that appeared to be growing in intensity and size in the sky to the south. It grew to about 2 or 3 times smaller than the moon, in other words this thing was the largest bright object in the sky except for the moon. It was very high, in the neighborhood of 30 thousand feet. Once it grew to what I would call its peek intensity it appeared to begin falling straight down and began to dim. It then began moving due south at a consistent altitude and dimming to about what an aircraft or satellite would resemble including the speed at which it was moving."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8917.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8917.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Little Rock","Case Number":"8917","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-92.286135","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Little Rock","There were no other sightings in Little Rock on or around January 13th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01162008-0003","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"01/13/2008 07:30 UTC","Summary":"Very Large Bright White Light","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"01/13/2008 07:30 UTC"}
