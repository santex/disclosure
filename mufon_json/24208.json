AT first thought it may a firework. Realized quickly it was not. Was concerned it may be a plane with its engines on fire. Looked like it may have been three orange glowing orbs close together, but again could not tell because it was too bright to make out any detail. I would estimate altitude at under 5k. Strangest part was that it made absolutely no noise at all. It moved from southwest-ish to northeast and then turned more north before I lost sight of it behind trees. I was not even going to report it here, but after looking at all the other orange glow reports from last night, felt it necessary. Hope the news reports it... I know many other people MUST have seen this and don't know what to do about it."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24208.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24208.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 02:35 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","City":"Greensboro","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-79.785805","Log Number":"US-07052010-0058","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"36.077075","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange-red glowing object across night sky.","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 10:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24208"}
