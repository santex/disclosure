I was reminded of it today while reading a report in the Denver post on the UFO Network Symposium. The article mentions Ken Storch, who while working for Offutt AFB new of 5 UFO's flying in formation. I was a senior in high school in 1974 and did a lot of star gazing with a friend. He had a 8 inch reflector telescope and we spent many hours at night looking at the stars. We saw the five objects pass across the view in the telescope. We were both amazed at how fast they were moving. No plane could have moved that fast. I am a sky watcher and even the satelites were not moving that fast. In fact we could not even follow the objects with the telescope. We knew this was something out of the ordinary. The formation was geese like with a lead, then two and then two in a arrow formation. The objects went across the sky from one horizon to the next. I do not remember the exact positon in the sky but it was almost directly overhead. I am sure the AFB just outside Boston has the information."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/5077.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/5077.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"5077","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Massachusetts","Longitude":"-71.649773"}
