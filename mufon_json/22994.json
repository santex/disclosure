I am now 50. This has happened to myself, my brother, my Mother, and my ex-wife. This case is being investigated by MUFON Tennessee, field investigator S. White. The investigation began in Feb, 2010, and has been quite detailed. I am now going to a hypnotherapist in Knoxville for regressive hypnosis. All of the reports and details were given to F.I. White and he has it all written. I am also willing to take a polygraph to insure my truthfulness. I have submitted drawings and other detailed information. I have detailed descriptions of the aliens, their ship inside, their symbols, and other things they do to abduct people. F.I. White has copies of all of this and will be submitting it all through the MUFON CMS."],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Cigar, Disc","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":[],"Date Submitted":"04/27/2010 02:42 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
