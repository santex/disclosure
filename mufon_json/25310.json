I thought it was a passenger airplane and was just going to watch it. The light was steady and bright, about as big and bright as Venus in the night sky. It was very high up. It suddenly went dark and I didn���t see it. I thought that was very odd. Then a few seconds later the light came back on. It was still traveling south to north and at the same rate of speed. A few seconds later it went dark again. I watched for a few minutes but did not see it again. I don't know what it was. The sky looked clear, and I could see stars and such. When the object went dark there were no clouds in the area. I didn't have any feelings of fear or excitement, just puzzlement. I didn't look much longer as I suddenly started getting a headache and my neck got tight. After that I came in to fill out the report. I started not to, because it doesn't seem to be one of the most exciting sightings, and it's probably something normal. I just have never seen planes do that light dark thing."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"09/05/2010 10:22 UTC","Case Number":"25310","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/05/2010 08:56 UTC","City":"Pensacola","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.423989,+-87.215835(25310)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25310) map </A>","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Pensacola","There were no other sightings in Pensacola on or around September 5th 2010"]}
