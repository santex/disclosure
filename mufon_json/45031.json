So they started putting cameras up around the areas. One night one camera caught a UFO. The news had spread throught the workers and they soon emailed to my father. My father had sent it to me and now I'm posting it here on mufon. When I saw the picture I couldn't believe how the shape was, it was what I had expected. More so since it was also hovering off the ground. I was used to different ufos mainly because I have seen some since I was a kid. It really got to me that I now have proof of the existence of these entities."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc, Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/05/2013 05:32 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/06/2012 10:04 UTC","Log Number":"US-01052013-0003","Longitude":"-99.235032","Case Number":"45031","Summary":"Hovering disk like craft with 3 lights hovering about a foot or less off the ground.","City":"Cotulla","Latitude":"28.436934","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON"}
