I noticed the moon that night and it was very beautiful so I snapped a picture over it and I saw this boomerang thing. I have seen these objects firsthand once before in Granbury, Texas. See the above picture for a good look. Sorry that the photo is so pixilated. I was in granburry texas when i was a boy and i saw this same thing, now when i saw it foirsthand, i saw the center light change from red to green, red to green, i believe it was taking a picture. The object literally fell out of the sky, it began as a star and sped down at an incredible rate. themn it hovered for about two minutes, then sped off into the distance. When i took this picture, i was actually photographing the moon, and noticed it later, my mind instantly went back to that night in granbury."],"Longitude":"-98.491677"}
