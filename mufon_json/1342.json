At the time I remember astrange blinking light through the trees in the back yard obscured by the pinetrees, but thought nothing of it as we are in the Hartsfield flight path. Acluple of minutes later I looked again and there were 3-4, then maybe 5 separatelights through the trees. They were fairly stationary, though they obviouslydarted back and forth, and up and down, on a constant basis. I observed this for2 hrs. before retiring, though they were still there. The SAME 4-5 lights werevisible the entire time, making it obvious that they were not aircraft, as Iobserve aircraft every night flying in. The FAA in Peachtree City informs metoday that they observed no UFOs or other strange blips on their radar lastnight. I find that hard to believe unless these objects were many miles away,which they could have been, as they only appeared the size of a large, brightstar."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.544278,+-84.233809(1342)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1342) map </A>","Latitude":"33.544278","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Log Number":"","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"01:59:00","Case Number":"1342","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/14/2001 10:30 UTC"}
