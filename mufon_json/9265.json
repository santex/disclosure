{"Summary":"Strange triangle with lights seen by Google Earth image.","divs":["Sighting DetailsI saw a picture of this strange triangle on a website and was able to find it myself using Google Earth. It does not appear to be a ground object or structure, therefore it must be in the sky. I would call it an unidentified object, because since it is a still photo you can't tell if it is flying. The triangle object is in the area of Cervantes, Australia near the corner of Bibby Road and Yeramullah Road in the vicinity of Badgingarra Park in Western Australia. The coordinates in Google Earth are: 30 30 36 50 S by 115 22 52 00 E. Hopefully someone locally could verify that this is not a ground object, and then we can proceed to find out what it actually is."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"42.869839","Date Submitted":"01/25/2008 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Cervantes","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-7.060073","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"AU-01262008-0005","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9265","Date of the Event":"01/25/2008 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9265.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9265_submitter_file1__Triangle1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9265_submitter_file2__Triangle3.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/9265_submitter_file3__Triangle5.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9265.html"],"City":"Cervantes","Tags":"City","Region":"Galicia","Country":"Spain","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.869839,+-7.060073(9265)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9265) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
