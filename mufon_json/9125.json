I could not tell how high the craft was in the sky overhead because all I saw were the four horizontal white lights that I could tell were on the craft. It was traveling very fast. Faster than any jet I have ever seen before. As the lights went over my head the lights turned vertical and I was speechlees because it made absolutley no noise. As I turned my head it kept its speed and I lost veiw of the lights in about two seconds. Nothing can travel that fast and be that low to the ground and not make a sound that we know is in existence It was just incredible."],"Longitude":"-119.414932","Region":"California","Case Number":"9125","Date of the Event":"12/18/2007 09:30 UTC","trends":[],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"36.781711","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.781711,+-119.414932(9125)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9125) map </A>","Log Number":"US-01212008-0023","City":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"12/18/2007 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
