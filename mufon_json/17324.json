After turning on the light I saw an object crossing over the house from the East traveling West. The object was about as large as a 747 and showed an odd lighting configuration. There were three bright lights in a triangle and there were lights moving from left to right flashing white, red, green and blue. I was hoping that this object would stay in the air so I could run down to the basement and grab my video camera. I telepathically asked this vehicle to please stay long enough so I could catch it on camera. I ran downstairs and got my camera and when I returned to the patio door I could still see the object although further West. I captured about 4-6 seconds of this object moving and several seconds of it at a distance. On the video you can only see a green strobe light flashing on the left and then the right side of the Triangle object. This is the first time I���ve had two sightings in two days. This object was about 1-3 thousand feet in the air. Very low in the sky. It was about 45���-50���. I also had a sighting of an object on Saturday May 30, 2009 of an object up about 40-50 thousand feet of a single object swaying in the blue sky for about 10 seconds."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17324.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17324.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"05/31/2009 10:31 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.6563,+-73.9405(17324)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17324) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.6563"}
