I set up my vidiocamera as shown on Sightings. I set up video camera in the window and blockedthe sun with the frame of the window. When I veiwed the tape I saw many oddstreaking objects all the way through the tape, and then I saw a much largerstreaking object. I then slowed the tape and saw the object moving from right toleft at a very fast pace. I have shown this tape to a MUFON agent in my area,Paul Coley of Linden Pa. I havent talked to him since. I actually wanted to getin contact with him. Thats why I am reporting this. Is it possible to get hise-mail or give him mine. I would like to go to one of the meetings again.
