Noticed something when was walking in the skys above. What seemed to be some type of glowing craft I would assume, but could not make out edges or anything just seemed to be a glowing object pretty high up. Was an extremely clear night, not a cloud in the sky! First thing I looked for was blinking markers but there was none, which made me quite interested in it. Wasnt moving very fast at all. Then proceeded to go inside. Realizing I had to get something from car went back out a second later. I looked up and it was still there traveling at same speed. Was very bright white... As I starred at it crossing overhead, it was very weird once again, there was no marker lights. The craziest thing happened it slowly disappeared into thin air! Unlike anything I've ever seen on such a clear night too with NO clouds. No sound either! Almost like it knew I was starring at it then cloaked!"],"Date of the Event":"03/17/2010 08:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/18/2010 11:46 UTC","City":"Old Bridge Township","Latitude":"40.32948","Object Shape":"Oval, Sphere, Star-like, Other, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03182010-0006","Case Number":"22359","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Region":"New Jersey"}
