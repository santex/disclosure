(8:30-9:00pm) she called me to the bedroom saying there was a light in the sky. i went upstairs (we live in a tri-level home, facing west on high ground with open space behind us affording us an excellent view of the front range) and saw a bright star like object. the object was west of my home at approximately the one o'clock position, high in the sky. i looked at it through my telescope. (meade ng 60ar with a 9mm eyepiece) the object was white and larger and brighter than objects normally viewed from my bedroom. viewed through the telescope the object pulsed, changing colors blue and orange\\red. there was no discernable shape. the object was stationary. i viewed it for several minutes. i told my wife i thought it may be a celestial object and atmospheric conditions may be causing the color changes. (ever being the skeptic) she continued to watch the object while i returned to the living room. thirty minutes (approx) later, she called out that the object \"just disappeared\". i returned to the bedroom and saw indeed, the object was no longer visible. i checked the western sky every few minutes after that. approximately thirty to forty minutes later i saw a similar object low in the western sky, (approx four o'clock) further north than the first sighting, possibly in the general direction of boulder. my wife called out at the same time that she too was seeing the object. i went upstairs and looked at the object through my telescope. this object was much closer than the first. it occupied more of the field of view that the first object. i could not discern a definitive shape but, i saw a row of lights on the bottom. they pulsed down the length, left to right changing colors as it went. (red, orange, white, blue-not in that particular order) there appeared to be a second, less discernable row of pulsing light above the other row. this gave the object a slight unfinished \"e\" look. the object then began to give off a circular faint white corona that slowly pulsed. this white light corona pulsed three or four times then the object just \"blinked out\". i had viewed this second object for about ten minutes before it blinked out. approximately a half hour later a third object appeared in the western sky. this object appeared similar to the first object but it was higher in the sky (near twelve o'clock) and because of its size viewed through the telescope it seemed to be further west. i watched the object continually through the telescope for nearly thirty minutes. it was moving slowly to the west. it moved on a flat, straight line trajectory until it had traveled out of my telescopes view. it did not \"set\" being the mountains like a celestial object. those objects travel from top to bottom in the field of view of the telescope. this object did not do that. based on the high altitude of the object it is possible it was near utah when i lost sight of it. this entire episode lasted from approximately 8:30pm until approximately 10:30pm."],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-05132010-0009","Summary":"My wife and I saw three seperate objects/events.
