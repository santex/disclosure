While en route she took several photos from the plane of different things (ocean, sky, etc). After she returned and the photos were developed I noticed a small brownish disk-shaped object on one of them. She swears she never saw the object while she was taking the pictures.I scanned the picture onto my computer and enlarged it. Unfortunately the enlarged photo is blurred because the object is so small. One of the odd things about it is that the UFO appears to be surrounded by some kind of \"halo\". Attached is the original photo and two enlargements. I apologize for not being able to highlight the object in the main picture (it is in the upper-left quadrant). On one of the enlargements I have adjusted the brightness and contrast to make the halo more visible. Any help you can offer in identifying the unknown object will be greatly appreciated. Thank you."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Houston","Region":"Texas","Summary":"Disk w/ Halo","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"-08052005-0005","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/30/1998 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"29.767573","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.767573,+-95.36225(3703)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3703) map </A>","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around June 30th 1998"],"Country":"United States"}
