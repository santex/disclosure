WITNESSES: RODERICK E GOUIN, BROTHER KEITH J. GOUIN, FATHER ROBERT F GOUIN SR. NEIGHBOR TIMOTHY ELLIS. WE WALKED 300 YARDS TOWARD THE CRAFT TO APPROX 100 YARDS TO INVESTIGATE. I WAS NOT FRIGHTEND AS FOR ALL OF US. A FEW MINUTES LATER CRAFT ROSE SILENTLY TO ABOUT 10 FEET OFF THE GROUND. THEN SLOWLY HOVERED AWAY. AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT INCREASED IN SPEED AND DISAPEARD TWOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST, NEVER MAKING A SOUND. THE NEXT MORNING I INVESTIGATED THE AREA TO FIND THE GROWING HAY WAS FLATTENTED IN A CIRCULAR PATTERN OF ABOUT 20 FEET IN DIAMETER. PERSONAL NOTE: I DO EXPERIENCE ABDUCTION DREAMS AT A VIVID LEVEL. AS OPPOSED TO SKETCHES I WILL SIMPLY REPORT IT LOOKED LIKE A RATHER ROUND BRIGHT SILVER DISK ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FULL SIZE VAN."],"Country":"United States"}
