At approximately 9:00 PM EDT he noticed two very bright lights in the southern sky travel northward toward his location. The lights passed east of his location moving northward and then turn to the northwest and moved out of sight. Witness state he thought lights might have been up over the Cassopolis street area of the city of Elkhart IN at that point. That would put these lights about 3 miles northeast of the objects noted in the correlating case below. The elevation required for that would have been very low on the northeast horizon. That is a probability but more likely distance would probably be something less."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Wakarusa","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08012013-0004","Date of the Event":"06/15/2013 12:00 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
