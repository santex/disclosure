I heard the first helicopter which is not unusual for where I live; I look up and it had a search light on facing forward. I then hear a second helicopter coming in from another direction so I paused and took a moment to look around. A black triangle caught my eye and the helicopters were in pursuit. I live close to an airport and know the difference as the aircraft make a lot of noise and the lights are different. The only noise I heard were the crickets and helicopters, no noise from the object which was traveling faster than the black helicopters. I lost site of the object due to trees blocking my view as it. The last time I saw a triangle UFO (or any UFO for that matter) was in Bedford, TX in 1998."],"Object Features":"Wings, Unknown","Region":"New York","City":"Ronkonkoma","Date of the Event":"10/17/2012 06:50 UTC","Case Number":"43335","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
