{"divs":["sighting details\"full description & details it was a summer night, maybe about 10pm or so. i was driving south on the bronx river parkway, going south, just opposite the mt. vernon (metro-north) train station. i was driving my 1979 buick regal (with t-tops off) when i saw a boomerang shaped object going south (parallel to the parkway) over my head. i was going about 60 mph as the object passed overhead. when i got a good focus on this object i slowed down and pulled into the right hand lane, my speed was now about 5 or 10 mph as was the speed of the other cars who also saw this object. we all just crept along looking up at this object. it made no sound at all and also slowed down to match our speed. it was about as high as a 20 or 30 story building (judging by the height of the apartment buildings just to the west of the parkway which vary from 5 to 12 (aprox) stories. when it got just past the train station it stopped, as did all of the cars going south on the parkway. it paused for a few seconds and then pivoted\\turned to the east and started to move again but now was going east and picked up speed to about 50 or 60 mph. as i was looking at it along with the other cars on the parkway it was clear as could be in the shape of a boomerang but huge.... similar to a very large jet airliner but no body just the wings and much larger...maybe 3 or 4 times larger than a 747. i saw no colors, only luminous panels covering the entire bottom of the object. these panels were rectangles and some of them were emitting bright light and some were barley putting out any light at all. it continued to the east for maybe 20 seconds to the top of my view east and was above some houses and trees when it made another pivot\\turn to the south this time. it started to move south for 2 or 3 seconds when it accelerated so fast that it looked like a solid white line pointing south, the object \"stretched\" to the south and then the back or the line \"caught up \" with the front of the line and it was gone. people looking at it from the parkway, all of whom had come to just about a full stop, kind of looked at each other and then resumed thier driving. nobody said a word about what had just happened, they just went about their business....this was very weird . i had a friend in the car with me but i really don't remember saying anything to him while this was happening. when the object was gone we did talk about it but , looking back now, neither of us was scared or panicked. we both told other friends about this object and even drew sketches of it...nobody believed us! and i never read or heard about anyone else seeing this object. to this day it is as clear in my mind as the night it happened..\" this statement was copied from \"http:\\\\www.ufoevidence.org\\sightings\\report.asp?id=973\" where i posted it on 1\\16\\2004 8:57:53 am. i have also fixed some of my spelling mistakes in this posting."],"Date Submitted":"06/30/1980 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"8317","Longitude":"-73.836009","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.915799,+-73.836009(8317)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8317) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Mt Vernon","There were no other sightings in Mt Vernon on or around June 30th 1980","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Region":"New York","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Latitude":"40.915799","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Summary":"in the shape of a boomerang.... similar in size to a very large jet airliner but no body just the wings and much larger...maybe 3 or 4 times larger than a 747.
