I have a window next to my bed and when I looked out I saw something bright in the sky. It was a bright orange orb just hovering in the sky at least a mile away. It was bigger than a star, maybe comparable in size to a small pea held at arms length. Soon after I noticed it, it moved to the left a bit, not incredibly fast but very smooth and gracefully. Then the orb got much brighter and faded out. I didn't see it again after that. The whole sighting probably lasted no longer than 30 seconds."]}
