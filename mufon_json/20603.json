I was suddenly aware of a strange tension in the air and my hair began to stand on end, beneth the many layers I had wrapped up in because of the winter weather. My dog, Saber, an Alsatian, began to cower in fear of some unseen object overhead, and began to pull on the leash. I was suddenly very light headed and saw several different combinations of flashing lights above me. I woke up outside the swimming pool in Prestwick six hours later, my eyes bloodshot and with an orange liquid coming from my nose."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"11/19/2009 04:56 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United Kingdom","Date of the Event":"11/16/2009 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-4.249086","Object Shape":"Egg","Latitude":"55.871567","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Glasgow","There were no other sightings in Glasgow on or around November 16th 2009"],"Summary":"Large, metallic, covered in different coloured flashing lights.","City":"Glasgow","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=55.871567,+-4.249086(20603)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20603) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"GB-11192009-0006"}
