When checking the previous nights footage I was surprised and a little scared to find it had recorded some strange beams. There are several very unusual things of note. The first beam in the video looks to be going straight through a concrete tiled porch roof. It is also interesting to see that the beams did not illuminate the area whatsoever. The area is not well lit as it is only illuminated by 4 infrared led's mounted on the b&w camera. Please note the time jumps as the software is only set to record movement. The red lines make a box that the software is set to exclude movement such as plants. I have included a still daytime image to give a better idea of the area. At the top corner is part of the roof structure. Comments are very much welcome. I am at a loss as to what it was.. any ideas?????"],"trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in Perth","There were no other sightings in Perth on or around June 26th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21731.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21731_submitter_file2__200806261306331.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21731.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Other","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"06/26/2008 02:05 UTC","Region":"Western Australia","Summary":"Strange searchlight recorded by home security camera","Longitude":"115.866939","Object Features":"Other, Unknown","City":"Perth","Log Number":"AU-02012010-0001","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"Australia","Case Number":"21731","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:06:00","Date Submitted":"02/01/2010 05:50 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-31.946144,+115.866939(21731)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21731) map </A>"}
