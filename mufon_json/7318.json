I looked up and saw a orange light and thought at first it was a star but I then noticed it was moving in our direction. I then pointed it out to my sister and we watched it for 4 or 5 minutes. The orange light was not blinking and was at first moving like a jet and then it took a 90 degree turn to the left going out of sight behind the tree in my front yard. My sister and I moved over to see on the other side of the tree and there it was again. It then moved toward us again and then took a 90 degree turn to the right, then in a split second it went straight up and was gone. I am a true believer in ufo's and at night I am always watching the skies. I am 49 years of age and this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this. It was awsome."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.652865,+-78.762518(7318)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7318) map </A>"}
