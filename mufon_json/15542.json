By the time we reached out of the back door and on to the patio there it was over our neighbors roof these were one story houses and very close together and we just kinda stood there watching it hover it looked like liquid sliver not bolts or seems no doors or windows anywhere on it I remember looking very carefully for those things. Then we stood there for about 5 min just staring at it I could have thrown a rock and hit it thats how close it was the day was bright and clear as a bell. There were 4 of us my mother , little brother and my friend from across the street My mother went over and climbed the fence we had a over lapping wooden privacy fence she climbed it as this was going on I noticed that it had lights pulsating around the middle they were on and slowly going round it it was slowly very slowly turning but yet looked almost at a stand still just floating about only a few feet from the roof peak and kinda at a tilt . As my mother climbed the fence she reached out to it why I don't know she never has said but,as she reached up to it as she did we (the three kids just stood there at that point silent watching ) Then I don't know why it started turning faster like picking up it's rotating speed but not real fast and the lights picked up their rotation speed at this point I guess it hit me my mother is right under it and I remembered from either reading or something just told me to and I calmly called over to my mother If you don't bother them mom they wont bother us she then turned her head and looked back at me and realized what she was doing but I still don't remember being that scared really just cautious maybe I don't know she ran back to us kids and because she did so I think that scared us more then the disc being so close did and then we ran back into the house just into the door and stopped for like a second then then my mother and I looked at each other and smiled real big like we can't miss this call us crazy we ran back out to see what it would do next by this time it was hovering over our back yard but by this time it was up higher in the sky and it just stayed there hovering for a few minutes like it new we were coming back out and we looked up and started to wave at it we new it was leaving at this point don't ask me why and all of a sudden it shot straight up into the sky like a bullet and disappeared into the sky and thats my first encounter we didn't take a picture because we didn't have film at the time and decided not to report it cause back then you only had as far as we knew the police or the military to reported it and I told my mother not to call them I am now 43 years old and have seen many since then day night time not as close but with in the area I have lived within a 10 to 12 year period basically 4 more since I'll never forget it"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Case Number":"15542","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.287002,+-84.485221(15542)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15542) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Dome, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"this is one of many different types I have had","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-84.485221","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"39.287002"}
