{"Tags":"City","Case Number":"20826","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","divs":["sighting details i live north west of howell city, just enough to avoid the city lights. actually i have the biggest airport in livingston county just accross the street and through the woods. so the u of m emergency helicopter and small jets take off pretty often. so i know what the diffrent planes look and sound like that they keep there. anyways,my freind and i were enjoying one of the last nice clear night before it gets too cold. we were enjoying the stars on my back porch. my freind asked me to take a look at the skys just north of howell and north east of us. he said he noticed something odd and wanted me to check it out. now the night was very clear,only a few small clouds flew low in the sky. what i saw i first thought i was a star. but then it started to shimmer and pulsate a bit. suddenly this \"orb\" started taking huge leaps in elevation and dirrection. looking at something stationary like the tops of the two pine trees. you clearly could see this thing was taking incredible leaps in direction and speed so fast,then it would stop and hover momentarily. at first my logic made me thing it was a helicopter. but what is a helicopter doing at 4:30am flying with a huge white spot light on its self? no sound eventhough it was low like a plane circleing for a landing. my freind and i are experienced star gazers and never seen anything remotely close to this before. we could clearly see this thing flying through the few low clouds in the sky. as it flew through and past the clouds its lights reflected on\\through the clouds. like a glowing nimbus. so obviously its not a star. we watched this thing for well over an hour. all i have is a consumer grade camcorder and camera,so i didnt bother taking any video\\pics. i have never seen any aircraft make such sudden and erratic changes in flight path and elevation. then we also noticed another one of the exact same phenomenon flying above the west side of the airport. they moved up,down the left,right. both with a white light that seemed an ord. with green and maybe some red pulsatings lights. i say pulsate becauce they didnt seem to flash. maybe the pulsating was from the craft changing dirrection. the objects didnt steadily move over time like the stars behind them. nore did i see them the next night at the same time\\location? i even saw a jet fly far above and behind it. so i know it was closer. this was my first unexplained experience and am still trying to logically be skeptical. but we both saw the same thing? i am surprised no one else reported it. i was sure they would. eventhough it was very late\\earily. but it went on for well over an hour. then i went in to warm up and they were both gone?"],"Date Submitted":"12/01/2009 11:32 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20826.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20826.html"],"Summary":"Giant Orb with green and white lights. changed elevation and direction so fast.","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"42.615205","Log Number":"US-12012009-0007","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Howell","There were no other sightings in Howell on or around November 28th 2009"],"Region":"Michigan","City":"Howell","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.615205,+-83.924415(20826)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20826) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Dome","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-83.924415","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle","Date of the Event":"11/28/2009 04:22 UTC","Country":"United States"}
