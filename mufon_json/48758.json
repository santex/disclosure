It appeared at first to be a comet. I quickly realized what I was seeing was not a comet. After 15-20 seconds 3 other similar shapes and light follow. First forming a 3 light triangle with one of the objects being offset. Then they form a straight line and each object fades in and out for about 1 minute to 1 minute and 30 seconds. After 3 minutes they fade out and do not reappear. 1:58 seconds was captured on video."],"Case Number":"48758"}
