{"Latitude":"34.092234","divs":["sighting detailsi am a california attorney. i meditate, i'm a reiki master, i seek higher consciousness, self-realization and enlightenment. i am now into taoism & buddhism. i am also a little into remote viewing & remote influencing. i consider myself to be spiritual. my relationship to god is of primary importance in my life. i also have my bs degree in zoology\\biology. i had a few out of body experiences while meditating many years ago. at 3:00 am on sat august 25, 2007 i had my first verifiable \"encounter\" with something i never experienced before. while reading a book on taoism before bedtime, i was surprised that our cockatiel bird began his talking routine just before 3:00 am while in the total dark with a bed sheet over his cage like usual. he has never done this before. i thought that was odd, continued reading, then got into bed & fell asleep. just after i fell asleep i was abruptly & consciously aware of a higher pitched noise and a beam of 2 shades of green pulling what felt like only my consciousness, not my body, up and into a dimly lit domed room\\place. i said to myself \"oh no, not again,\" then fought it and began to awake, it being hard to move or call my wife's name out loud. she was asleep upstairs. when i sat up fully awake at 3:00 am, the hairs on both arms & legs were standing up & i was pretty much in terror. i am age 50 and can't recall the last time my hair ever stood on end! my room was dark and as i sat there, i saw in 2 shades of green, what i describe as threads of green light everywhere that i looked in the room. i got out of bed, walked all over my 2 story house, didn't wake anyone up, looked out my front door, calmed down & went back to bed & fell asleep. i didn't tell my wife or daughter till that evening & believe me, that was a very difficult thing to do. it seemed so weird to even hear myself utter the description of what i went thru. a few days later, my wife went next door & talked to the neighbor woman about listing their house for sale, as the prior listing expired. she asked my wife if anything weird happened in our house at 3:00 am on 9\\25. my wife said no. the neighbor then told her that at 3:00 am their home burglar alarm went off, \"went crazy,\" & a wind like a tornado rattled their windows, then the next morning, while washing their backyard patio, as they do every morning, they washed away a burnt dust, saying it was not dirt, it was some kind of weird burned dust or particles. my wife came back & said to me \"you'll never believe what the neighbor just told me.\" my hair stood a little on end again when she told me the above. it was so cool to have my experience verified by my neighbor - that something really happened - that i wasn't dreaming or that i imagined it. i like astronomy, & star trek, but never read about abductions or ever thought much about it. i have heard weird sounds at night in bed coming from outside up above, kind of freaked me out, then feel asleep. i have no memory of anything happening. i love to take a mile walk several times a week after dark & pick out many stars by name - done that for years."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8489.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8489.html"],"Case Number":"8489","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.092234,+-117.435048(8489)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8489) map </A>","Date Submitted":"08/25/2007 03:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-11272007-0009","Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-117.435048","Region":"California","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"attempted abduction/transport of consciousness & possibly body","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Fontana","There were no other sightings in Fontana on or around August 25th 2007"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/25/2007 03:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Fontana"}
