The path took them strait over head. The spread of light gave itthe look of a large aircraft, but when the light past under a high cloud therewas no aircraft between the 6 bright points of lights. There were only lightsblue sky and a few high clouds. I was on Trout lake running an out boardmotor,and i could not hear anything but I expected a sonic boom judbing from thespeed of the lights and the fact they were in the atmosphere. There was none.the lights left going NE.People on shore who could not see the sky reported tome that they heard a strange sound in the sky unlike any other aircraft.
