Since October of 2008, when I first noticed and reported what I saw then, every night the weather permits and there is no cloud coverage, I never fail to see the following: 1. Type of craft that is high in altitude, stationed far above the regulation of US air traffic in the same geographical areas without fail nightly. This one is the type that has the colored lights and produces small yellowish orbs that shoot out from it and return. This orb activity is generally in close range to the large bright craft that usually just stays at its station, however the orbs are capable of moving about and I have seen them go long distances form the large stationed ship. The only time I saw this type up close was with a spotting scope (magnification of 60X), which was not powerful enough to really see any more detail than with my normal vision. The main craft does change in light intensity at times. The colored lights seem to rotate from left to right or in a counter clockwise direction. When the orbs shoot out they seem to be fast and flash just long enough to determine their directional pattern, either to or from the large craft. As the earth rotates, the position in the sky usually causes them to drop out of view because this craft is stationed permanently. And not only this one, but there are several of these type and each has its own station. 2. Type of craft that appears as a bright white star. It is intensely white and spherical. These are capable of maneuvers in erratic patterns and tend to be still for a while, and suddenly move several degrees in a split second. The motions of this type of craft are erratic! I have seen them go from left to right so fast it looks like a white line. I also noticed these craft making circular swirls, zigzag, star, and wavelike patterns of flight. There are no flashing colored lights on the white star type but like the first type I mentioned, they do have orb activity associated with them. The orbs are the same yellowish color and seem to behave as with the colored type of craft. 3. Type of craft that is red and dimly lit up. No flashing lights. They are capable of speeds in excess of the speed of sound by several times. On occasion is seen moving across the sky at night and can go from one side of the horizon to the other in eight to ten seconds. I have never seen a red craft change course, always fly in a straight line pattern. 4. Type of craft that is dark with a light grey round dome in the center on its underbelly. Like the red, this craft has no fleshing lights at all but this type does not glow. It is very stealth and dark. It���s very hard to see. I have only seen this type once. It was motionless, and suddenly went out of sight from a stationed position. With all the above mentioned craft, no sound is ever associated with any of these. I study these every night the weather permits and do have feelings that are not important. What seems important is this. I see them every night...and generally only hear of when others report a random sighting. Not willing to speculate, but if one were to guess, our government knows and is not telling. The biggest question on my mind: Are we being introduced to what others have known slowly on purpose? Or, another secondary question that goes with that. Do these craft, and any possible intelligence or beings associated with them, simply no longer care if they are being witnessed?"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19955.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19955.html"],"Longitude":"-92.657767","Tags":"City","City":"El Dorado","Object Shape":"Disc, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Latitude":"33.20933","Case Number":"19955","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Arkansas","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Log Number":"US-10152009-0008","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"IFO","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/15/2009 04:50 UTC","Summary":"Witnessed two types of craft.
