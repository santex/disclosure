We live in the desert, clouds mean some kind of weather. Looking above the line, I saw a bright light in the distance-North to where I am located. It was far off but I watched it and it simply moved a little downward like it was descending. I turned my head to tell my daughter to come outside and when I turned around again, it was gone. Less than say, 3 minutes later, still hanging laundry, I saw another ball of light (maybe the same) this one also North but closer than the last one. Still too far to make out a shape other than a \"ball of light\" that I can think of. It slowly pulsated its white light, even through the cloud cover. It then looked like it was heading towards the ground. It broke from my site. An airliner passed overhead not a minute or so later and even though that was also way off in the distance it was obvious that it was an airplane."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Tuba City","There were no other sightings in Tuba City on or around June 23rd 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/23/2013 11:50 UTC"}
