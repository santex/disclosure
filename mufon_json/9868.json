The first man described the two orange lights a bit aways from each other, then they moved in together and disappeared. The other two men saw these same lights the next night together, but they said there was three, disappeared and reappeared before disappearing finally. I'm pretty sure the first man only told me about his sighting, so i doubt the three are trying to trick me. Finally, right after the two men saw the lights, another co-worker who has a radio told me that several people in the city were calling into the radio station about the lights. Both sightings happened around the same time of night(breaktimes) so I'll be watching the sky around that time next shift with my video camera in hand...It may be nothing, but I thought I'd tell you..."],"trends":["There have been 61 other sightings in Kokomo","There were 2 other sightings in Kokomo on or around March 5th 2008"]}
