I always go out by the pool and have a smoke as soon as i get up. I've always been a sky watcher, so I scanned the skies, enjoying the stars. I'm facing east, and out of the north at about a 45' angle at about the 10:00 position, I see 4 lights moving in unison. I could determine that they were all on the same craft. I can't say at what altitude. I watch them until they reach about the 12:00 position at the same 45' angle at my position. It was moving in a southerly direction and after it crossed the 12:00 position, the lights started fading and simply vanished. I watched in the line of flight to see if it reappeared, thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me. Nothing. I waited on engine noise.
