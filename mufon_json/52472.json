I discovered a cigar-shaped object that was flying way faster than planes would do (we have 3 airports around and it didn't look like a human made aircraft). The object was brightly glowing and there were no wings, positioning lights, turbines etc. visible and it didn't leave any trails in the sky. Moreover I opened the window but couldn't hear anything but the usual sounds of the city, but no planelike sounds or anything that could have come from the object."],"Date Submitted":"11/28/2013 09:36 UTC","Summary":"Cigar-shaped brighty glowing object flying from nw to sw"}
