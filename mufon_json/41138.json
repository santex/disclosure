I live in the country and it is really dark, I love to go out in the evening and sit on our deck and look at the stars. I noticed the lights one night when I was coming home from town there were 3 lights in the form of a triangle, facing east. What got my attention is the fact that they change colors. I have seen them several times. Last night I had the kids out on the deck looking at them as well. At first I was a little scared but as long as they stay in the air I know I'm fine. Some times I go to a conservation area not to far from my house and sit and watch them, because its completely dark there."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Green Castle","Region":"Missouri","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41138.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41138.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41138.html"],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-07252012-0011","Case Number":"41138","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/25/2012 11:11 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Sphere"}
