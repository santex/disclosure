I noticed that it disappeared and after a couple of minutes it reappeared. At first I thought it was a street light then I remembered there was no street light in that location. The orb was directly in between to street lights and higher in the sky than the street lights. I went and got my camera and started recording it. The object would disappear and reappear. This went on for about an hour. I also noticed smaller orange orbs going up to and some would go up to it and then away from it. I wondered what it was doing and if it might come closer to me. After about an hour the orb disappeared and did not reappear. I watched to sky for a while longer to see if it would reappear and it didn't. I watched to sky every time I went out that night to see if it would come back and it didn't."],"Latitude":"33.388012","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.388012,+-112.562878(43309)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43309) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/16/2012 07:38 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43309.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43309.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-10162012-0021","Region":"Arizona","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Buckeye","There was one other sighting in Buckeye on or around October 12th 2012"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-112.562878","Object Shape":"Cigar"}
