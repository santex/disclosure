{"divs":["sighting detailsbeaumont ca - while waiting in line to enter oak valley parkway (closest intersection beaumont ave) just as the night was getting dark, significant high cloud cover, i looked east to check traffic. my intended path was west, eventually south on beaumont ave. i looked east to check the safety of moving into traffic and happened to notice what i thought initially was a plane flying pretty much right above oak valley heading west from cherry ave., appx 1\\2 mile away. the plane seemed rather low flying, maybe 200 feet in the air. i defined it as a plane due to the configuration of the lighting, wingtip lights both horizontal and vertical. traffic was not clear, so i continued to scan east. i then noticed the plane had not traveled very far, maybe 1 block at best, for how low and close it was. the distance from cherry ave to beaumont ave is appx 5 blocks, a plane would normally overtake that quickly. apparently i was mistaken, it had to be a helicopter based on this information. i then observed the \"helicopter\" make close turns over the blocks surrounding the area to the south, very close turns. this reinforced my thought it was a helicopter. at this moment, looking at the configuration of the lights, i realized the layout was wrong for a chopper. i rolled my window down as i entered the roadway heading west to listen - not a sound. i heard no noise from any traditional airplane or helicopter. i am now in line for the turn at beaumont ave, craning my neck into my mirror and alternatively pivoting to see the craft over the area behind me. the vehicle has not really moved far from its original area, seemingly circled and returned to its original path. the lights did not blink like normal aircraft and was missing the really bright fast blinking white light i usually see on civilian aircraft. the night was dark enough i could not make out the body of the vehicle, possibly. the lights were as follows: 4 red lights, 2 of which were not visible at all times apparently due to the orientation at the back(?) of the vehicle to my view, 2 lights on each wing tip(guess?) blinking at a very slow pace not in synch with each other (in fact one blinked off time with the other to eventually blink in unison for seconds, then well out of synch the remainder of the time). finally 2 \"headlight\" oriented lights, yellow\\green in color and unchanging. none of these lights seemed to illuminate the vehicle in any way. i had no option to stop longer and watch, for safety's sake. i had to make the turn and continue on. my destination was the corner of beaumont ave and 7th st, appx a mile away. as i exited my vehicle at 7th st. i heard the familiar and incredibly noticeable blade noise of a helicopter heading my way. i could hear it well over a mile away, not military (as they usually are really loud and booming). as the chopper flew overhead i clearly saw the outline of the vehicle, its lighting not only appropriately spaced for a helicopter but also consisting of a familiar standard white quick-blinking light identifying it to me as a vehicle i am sure is just a helicopter. the white blinking light even illuminated the tail section. obviously much of this was markedly different from the craft i had seen moments earlier. i returned to the area where my first sight of the craft occurred 15 minutes later, no luck in seeing the craft again. i initially thought this was a standard aircraft, from a quick look. by the time i had made my left turn to head south on beaumont ave, i was somewhat concerned as the vehicle did not fit my expectations of an aircraft i knew. my family and i attend airshows regularly here in southern california. nothing related to my sighting made me feel comfortable in the thought it was a known vehicle, but nothing made me feel it was extra-terrestrial in any sense either. it could be experimental, but i cannot fathom why the test would go forward in this sleepy town, at night, in sight of a large group of people protesting prop 8. i have attached my photoshop representation of my initial view of this craft. again, i could not see a shape, so this is all based on the light pattern."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.929461,+-116.977248(13677)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13677) map </A>","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"US-11122008-0006","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Beaumont","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Date of the Event":"11/02/2008 05:20 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13677.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13677_submitter_file1__UFO.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13677.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/02/2008 05:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"California","Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-116.977248","Country":"United States","Summary":"Silent hovering vehicle","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"33.929461","City":"Beaumont","Case Number":"13677"}
