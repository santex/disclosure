{"Summary":"Strange lights photographed above Regent Street in centre of London.","divs":["sighting detailsdear sir\\madam, i was walking home from work last night and when crossing oxford circus i noticed a women taking a photo looking down towards regents park. the clouds looked quite nice and i had my new camera on me which i wanted to use so whipped it out and took a couple of photos down towards the same area. when catching the bus minutes later, i reviewed the photos and when magnifying them i noticed some quite interesting lights in the sky which can be seen in all three photos, although not as clearly in the first two as i didnt have the exposure set correctly. they are, however, clear enough to see that they are moving across the sky over the course of the three photos. i couldn't say what these lights were so thought to tell someone who might have the resources to investigate, and maybe find the women who stood next to me also taking photographs. i have attached all three photos and below listed the exact times they were taken. look forward to your response."],"Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"17420","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17420.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17420.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"London","Region":"England","Date Submitted":"06/11/2009 09:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.509219,+-0.124025(17420)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17420) map </A>","trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around June 11th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United Kingdom","Log Number":"GB-06112009-0011","Date of the Event":"06/11/2009 09:30 UTC","Longitude":"-0.124025","Latitude":"51.509219","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City"}
