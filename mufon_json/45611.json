When he pulled back into our driveway he looked up and noticed a orange ball of light hovering in the sky. He ran into the house and grabbed our camera and went to our front porch and began filming. He filmed approximately two and a half minutes of footage. This is the fourth time this object has appeared over our home. It always does the same thing, hovers and shines brightly, changes colors from orange to white and darts around, and then disappears. Since we've seen this object before we already knew what it was going to do, we've just never been able to film it! Our reactions and feelings were of joy and exuberance that it finally showed back up so we could get it recorded."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"02/06/2013 08:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45611.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45611.html"],"Object Features":"None"}
