As soon as this formation of lights came into my view I stood up because something seemed strange about the lights. I noticed these lights that were in a triangular formation with a smaller green light in the front and two very bold yellow lights in the back. I couldn't see an object behind these lights at all and it made no noise that I could hear of. The the strangest thing was that only the back right yellow light seemed to be pulsating. It wasn't flashing like you see on your typical airplane but it was pulsating. It was moving in a straight line moving from West to East coming from the USA side of the St.Lawrence river. It continued to move in this path until it was just a single point of light in the sky then it was out of my view because it had moved behind my neighbors house so I couldn't see it anymore. I couldn't judge the actual speed of it but considering how low it was it seemed to be moving a a fairly fast speed"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Region":"Quebec","Longitude":"-71.320178","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.76528,+-71.320178(31143)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31143) map </A>"}
