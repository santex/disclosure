They were more of an orange color and much too large to be stars; I didn���t count them, I guesstimate around 9, always staying an equal distance from each other. When I first saw them one end appeared to be below the tree line so I thought someone must be flying a string of something from their house (this too didn���t seem likely but in my head I was desperately trying to make sense of what I was seeing), however as I proceeded along the highway I got to where I was right underneath the lights (Seward Highway and Stony Creek Ave) and found they were not below the tree line and in fact were very slowly moving along in a southerly direction (toward town). They were not in any formation, more like a string of lights moving along together although when I first saw them and was making my way closer (and therefore the angle of my view changing as I went) some of them formed into a pentagon for a short time. I stopped when they were right above me, as it was night I can���t really say how high they were but maybe another trees length above tree line. After I stopped I tried to focus in on one to see if I could make out the shape but it was too bright. I decided to go the rest of the way to my house and get a neighbor to look with me but as soon as I got just a ways down the road they were out of sight below the tree line and I did not go back for another look."],"Log Number":"US-03282011-0001","Summary":"I saw what seemed to be a string of lights, large orange spheres moving very slowly in a southerly direction.","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
