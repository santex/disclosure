On his back deck it overlooked the downtown Kirkland area towards Seattle. It wasn't until about 45mins later that when we were overlooking the Kirkland area that I saw what looked like a white ball moving quite fast heading north over Kirkland horizontally (while I was seeing this and keeping my eyes on the ���target��� I ask my friend if he is seeing what I am seeing and he replied yes and continued watching) and then all off a sudden it started to speed up and then it multiplied and we now saw three or more objects now heading north horizontally like six times fast than when it first started off and then soon after disappeared. Right after that happened my friend and I decided to go inside for we were freaked out about what we just saw. I am a VERY skeptical person and today I still don't believe in UFO's or anything of the sort but I still to this day can't figure out what the heck that was. I am curious about people sighting but there is a big part of me that says they are full of it and I guess I still won���t believe until something more major I guess happens to me."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"19086","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19086.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19086.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.684068,+-122.204935(19086)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19086) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/05/2009 05:43 UTC","Region":"Washington"}
