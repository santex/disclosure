When I viewed the pictures, it was very similar to an experience I had in April 2007 while I was working in downtown Atlanta one night. At that time, we had many calls to the TV station, witnessing the same object. It was very large, about the size of a C140 aircraft, made no noise, and was at an altitude of about 10,000 feet. It moved ver fluid-like, and was iridescent in color. I tried to get a camera, but it had gone. Our viewer sent us this picture of the exact same thing seen in the skies, two years later. Do you have any idea what it is?"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Region":"Georgia","Country":"United States"}
