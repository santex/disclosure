Me my son and our crew chef noticed that the stars are very bright and my son and I stated that we have seen satalites on a night like this, our crew chef had never seen one so for about 30 min. we all started looking for some, but only saw falling stars and getting cold from the night air. As we decided to go in, over the horizon at about 45 deg we saw a rectagled object fly south, it had soft fant lights only at the points with a soft yellow straght lines connecting the corners. It was moving at 10-15 mph and made no noise, there was no rotation just straght flight it continued south until it disapered. We were left with only question. this is no aircraft. this is not man made. and it looked like it was able to cloke itself."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33631.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33631.html"],"Log Number":"US-11272011-0003","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","Date Submitted":"11/27/2011 03:23 UTC"}
