So, in looking up to the NE, I noticed these bright flashing lights. The green and red caught my eye. As I studied it I thought maybe a plane or heliocopter. Just then 2 planes were passing by. One going East the other West just below the bright lit object. There was no comparision to the object and size. The planes were very small compaired to the object. Also, the planes had to be closer. I watched for about 2 minutes then called out my 2 sons to witness it. They both agreed it was no plane. Just what it was I don't know, maybe a satilite or something else. Who know's. After over an hour it still in the same spot!!!"],"Region":"Michigan","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Mackinaw City","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"Bright lights flashing, object never moved, it's not the space station, humming sound in distance. after 1 hour still in same place."}
