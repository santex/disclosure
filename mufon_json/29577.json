There was an aircraft approaching from the wsw moving to the ene. There were 3 amber lights, one on each point of the triangular aircraft with a solid red light on the belly of the craft. This craft was out of my line of sight after 3 minutes. A few minutes later on the eastern sky there were two aircrafts moving to the south...while I was watching one of them \"disappeared\", which I am guessing it went lights out. It appeared shortly thereafter either closer to me or much higher in altitude. It hovered and reversed heading to the north, just as being reported by pilots. Then they were out of my line of sight...as clouds moved in. I was excited to see the aircraft which I believe are the Boeing TR-3B, from their Phantom Works project. I was able to catch a few photos with my digital camera."],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Heber Springs","There were no other sightings in Heber Springs on or around June 15th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Log Number":"US-06162011-0005","Case Number":"29577","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29577.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29577_submitter_file1__P1010242.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29577_submitter_file2__P1010246.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29577_submitter_file3__P1010244.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29577.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.497138"}
