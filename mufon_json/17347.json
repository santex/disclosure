{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on a trip to phoenix and while taking some pictures with a friend on the apache trail outside of phoenix. No one was around for miles and either of us saw anything. It was a clear hot day not sure what direction I was facing but, it was mid day on the 16th of MAY. When I came home I heard on the news that many people in phoenix called in UFO sightings that same Saturday. When I downloaded the pictures we found the one I am submitting for analysis. I have never been a believer (yet) but I would love to have this photo professionaly analysed. Can you help?"],"Latitude":"33.450877","Longitude":"-112.068987","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.450877,+-112.068987(17347)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17347) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Arizona","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around May 16th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Hoax","City":"Phoenix","Date of the Event":"05/16/2009 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17347.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/17347_submitter_file1__ARIZONAUFO094.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17347.html"],"Case Number":"17347","Summary":"Photo was taken and saw nothing at the time, untill later when downloaded pictures.","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06052009-0006","Date Submitted":"05/16/2009 12:00 UTC"}
