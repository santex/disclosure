There was two of us that seen it at the same time. We parked the car and got out to stare at it. It was climbing higher moving straight up... maybe curving a little tiny bit East. We ruled out an jet due to the odd looking shape. Also, I have never seen a smoke tail look like that. The smoke trail was rather short but, fanned out .. was quite amazing. At first we thought we were looking at the asteroid. After watching it and realizing it was moving UP..and its maneuvers led me to the conclusion it was indeed a UFO."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.011748,+-87.903746(29775)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29775) map </A>","Summary":"Daytime UFO/cylinder moving straight up at high altitude with a white fan smoke tail","Region":"Illinois","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29775.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29775.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Chebanse","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Chebanse","There were no other sightings in Chebanse on or around June 28th 2011"],"Object Shape":"Cylinder, Oval","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Case Number":"29775","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
