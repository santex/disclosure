But whatever it was , they were trying to protect me from probably eating something bad that night . Boy, what a memorable experience. What was that? I wish someone could tell me to this day. what an incredible experience."],"City":"Jacksonville","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"jacksonville bright energy balls blueish-white big about 300 of them in a clutter appearing went away making a boom sound","Tags":"City"}
