I was facing south towards Cheyenne mountain. I saw the lights, there were three lights about a thousand feet(it seemed it was halfway up cheyenne mountain), all in a line the light simaltamiusly shut off. This happened two more times, with the last sighting seeming that the object was moving, the lights appeared in a trangular shape almost seeming like they were separated or it was turning. We even drove all the way to the base of the mountain, the frontage road to N.O.R.A.D.
