The vehicle was not a heliocopter or balloon. It had no wings or external propulsion. I have seen a simalar vehicle on a ufo program on TV. When I say crablike, I mean it seemed to have legs extending around the body of the vehicle. I only saw the object for a short time,15 seconds or so. Trying to watch traffic ,as not to wreck, I took my I off the craft for a couple of seconds. When I looked back the craft had totaly disapeared? I first noticed the craft when I noticed a man shading his eyes to look at some thing over this building. When I looked toward where he was staring I noticed the craft. I can only speculate that this craft was some sort of advanced survalance vehicle from robins air force base. Or it possible be some ET?"],"Log Number":"US-02062009-0019","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15354.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15354.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Macon","There were no other sightings in Macon on or around July 15th 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Egg","Region":"Georgia","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Tags":"City","Summary":"Metallic crab like vehicle hovering over building in Macon, Georgia.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/15/2008 01:15 UTC","Case Number":"15354","Date Submitted":"07/15/2008 01:15 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Macon","Country":"United States"}
