Looked out and noticed 2 off-yellow lights in the sky. 1st thought it was one of our charter planes, but the light vanished and two other larger lights appeared next to each other a little higher. One light would vanish and another one would appear next to it. It spread across the sky then vanished. Clear night. I was downwind. No sound and there was nothing there after the lights vanished. My uncle, who has seen the lights out here before, saw them that night too. I knew it was not a plane. I used to sell planes and my father is a pilot. I quickly realized this was something off. I was amazed by what I saw. A week later my dad saw something similar, except they were multiple color. Were horizontal, went verticle, and them vanished. Something strange is going on in Stephenville."],"Object Features":"Unknown"}
