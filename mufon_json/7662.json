They just didn't seem like any birds I have ever seen. The bodies were kind of fat white ovals and the wings were short stubby black and pointed forward. They glinted in the sun and appeared to be made of metal. They slowly moved away and immediately 2 white spheres moved in behind them and then changed into the bird things. Then they moved away as well. Well, as luck would have it and THANK GOD for this, there was another worker on a scissor lift who saw the entire thing and verified it exactly as I have reported it. Why am I having so many sightings? I don't understand. Is anyone else having sightings on a regular and daily basis?"],"Tags":"City","Region":"Colorado","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
