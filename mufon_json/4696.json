I took a photo on April 17, 2006 from the location the sighting was witnessed. This is a daytime photo, and I used editing tools on my computer to mark the approximate location of the objects, and to blank out the identity of a co-worker( the whited-out area.) The photo is from a Motorola RAZR V3 cameraphone, zoom size is 4X. Unfortunately I didn't get photos of the objects as they appeared, so the photo is sort of a \"fix\" to give viewers a general idea of location and elevation."],"City":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Please see report filed on 04/11/2006"}
