We had a major storm blow thru the region earlier that day, which caused power outage, so I was able to look at the night sky and see the stars. There was no cloud cover, and dont recall the moon being out at the time. I was looking in a northernly direction when I viewed these 2 orange colored lights traveling together in a straight line. What struck me as odd was they stayed in a perfect 'formation', one never led or fell behind the other, it was if they were 'attached' and moving across the sky at a pretty fast rate of speed. They seemed to be at a high altitude, as I watched them, I viewed a lower flying conventional aircraft traveling SE to NW, intersecting the lights' flight path below them. I watched the lights travel across the viewable sky for about 10 minutes until I lost sight of them behind trees in the south."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.41658,+-80.161415(48970)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48970) map </A>","Latitude":"35.41658","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Albemarle","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
