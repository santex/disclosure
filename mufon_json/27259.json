Both of us being believers, yet never witnessed, immediately pulled over and got out of the car. This red light was just hovering and began to shoot what looked like red laser beams down to earth. These beams would go out about a second after being emmitted one after the other. After about 30 seconds of beam shooting the ufo started to float around the sky getting closer to us like it knew it was being watched. After 10 seconds of floating left to right, the red ufo simply dissapeared like turning off a house light.
