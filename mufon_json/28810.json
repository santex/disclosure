{"Log Number":"US-04252011-0006","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsSaw a ball of light, larger and brighter than the Southern star heading North. Object was at a lower altitude than passenger jets out of Florida and made no noise. I would see a jet about 10,000 feet about it and could hear the engines and see the collision lights. It appeared to jump forward as it was moving forward. The object stopped and rapidly got smaller in dia. very quickly until it was gone. It acted and appeared just like a sightling last year, but it was heading south. This makes three times in 1.5 years I have seen the same object all with no noise and brighter thatn surrounding stars. I never have time to get a camera due to the short duration of sighting. I'm well familiar with arcraft and their behavior and this was not a standard jet or helicopter. The sighting was in my back yard while walking my dogs."],"Date Submitted":"04/25/2011 02:20 UTC","Latitude":"30.764209","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28810.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28810.html"],"City":"St Marys","Summary":"Saw bright ball of white light erraticly moving North, stop, went straight up out of sight.","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"28810","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.764209,+-81.561859(28810)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28810) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"04/24/2011 08:46 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"00:01:10","Region":"Georgia","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in St Marys","There were no other sightings in St Marys on or around April 24th 2011"],"Longitude":"-81.561859"}
