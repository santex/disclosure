Contrails usually don't begin and end abruptly like that so it was just a bit strange. By the time I got in the driveway and into the house to get my camera it had softened and dispersed somewhat. But when I saw it it was sharper and more defined than the photos depict. I got two clear photos of it. Don't know what it was or if it is a military attempt to divert attention away from whatever happened this morning, but just a bit strange."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/06/2012 08:29 UTC","Latitude":"36.008248","Source":"MUFON"}
