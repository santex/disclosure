Thinking it might be a piece of change, I checked it out. It was a piece of metal, sort of melted looking. I took it in the house and cleaned it up with soap and water, and asked my husband what he thought it was. He said it looked like it broke off a piece of equipment and to throw it away. However, when I examined it, it was flat on the back, and looked almost like designs on the front. So, I started cleaning it with everything I could find to see if anything effected it. I used every cleaner and chemical I had and then started on everything my husband used on the cars. Nothing changed it except to make it cleaner and shinier and make the design seem to stand out more. Before I threw it away, I wanted a second opinion, so I got in touch with Mufon and they suggested I start here. Whether it could be anything or not, I don't know, but, I couldn't throw it away without checking first."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Found a piece of unusual metal.","Date Submitted":"05/31/2008 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-79.53727","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03132009-0009","City":"Knox","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.234506,+-79.53727(15999)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15999) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"15999","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15999.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15999.html"]}
