{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt the Hingham Bathing Beach on Sunday July 5, we had gathered to watch the annual fireworks display, launched from Button Island. We were facing northeast. Our attention was drawn to an orange-red object in the southeastern sky. It was maybe the size of a BB held at arm's length. At first we thought it was a plane, as the flight path to Logan Airport was in our line of sight from south to north (right to left). But it was a round ball of light that looked like fire, not the typical lights associated with commercial aircraft. Then the light appeared to stop moving and hovered in one position for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, the direction of travel reversed to the south-southeast and the object moved away at a high rate of speed, first horizontally and then vertically."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Hingham","There were no other sightings in Hingham on or around July 5th 2009"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-70.880588","Log Number":"US-07062009-0011","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.245367,+-70.880588(17866)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17866) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Fireball","Region":"Massachusetts","Case Number":"17866","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17866.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17866.html"],"City":"Hingham","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/05/2009 09:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"07/05/2009 09:30 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Orange light moved left, hovered for 5-10 minutes, reversed direction, and retreated at a high rate of speed.","Latitude":"42.245367"}
