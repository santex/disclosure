It wasn't a tractor, plane or anything like that. It just sat there but was WAY too bright. And it was very dark out. I was really scared and didn't want him to get out of the car. He did. I didn't. But I watched him walk through the field. All I could stare at was the bright light. The next thing I knew he was back in the car but it was much later and we were arguing over how mud got in the car. The light was gone and I asked him about it but he didn't remember it. I just wanted out of there, so we left. When we went to pick up my kids we'd lost 3 hours and his mother was worried sick."],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.798974,+-76.862194(8654)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8654) map </A>","Summary":"stopped by side of road at weird light lost time","Date Submitted":"08/31/1992 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.798974","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere","Case Number":"8654","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8654.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8654.html"],"Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
