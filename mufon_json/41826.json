It was sort of round & wobbly looking, & going rather slowly (So at first I thought it was a balloon or carrier bag) but then it started to flash a light from it, a red light. Then I suddenly saw about 4 smaller, bright, yellowish coloured bird-like shapes, flying around near it! They only flew around for a few seconds, then vanished, while the other thing continued to wobble about in shape (Sort of changing) & flashing a red light on it's edge, until I lost sight of it, going towards the Clapham Junction area. That'd mean it was travelling in a North-Easterly direction over London. weird eh? I was sitting outside a cafe having a drink when I just happened to look up & see it."],"Summary":"Balloon Sized Shape-Shifting Orange Orbe","Latitude":"51.45755","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.45755,+-0.206001(41826)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41826) map </A>"}
