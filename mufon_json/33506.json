What appeared to be a star began to shift in color patterns. At first glance, it was thought to be a helicopter or airplane but the unknown flying object began to shift back and forth. As I began to focus on the aircraft and think about the object's design the aircraft would shift in intensity likely increasing and decreasing in range. After observing the craft for some time, the white light would appear and dissappear. Within 30 minutes of witnessing the craft, there was a laser beam that was shot at the craft and it dodged it. The light was red and appeared to be a laser and traveling at a high rate of speed. It shows the aircraft has a high manueverability. Don't have any video, nor camera just observations."],"Disposition":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.61568,+-79.488623(33506)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33506) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"N/A","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Other, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33506.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33506.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"33506","Longitude":"-79.488623","Weather Factors":"None","Object Flight Path":"N/A","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Nesmith","There were no other sightings in Nesmith on or around September 19th 2011"],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.61568","Summary":"UFO High Maneuverability Demonstrated - Laser","Region":"South Carolina"}
