(we had actually just finished christmas shopping for the day) about the time i passed the finn hill exit i noticed a very bright light in the sky. i thought it was a plane or a helicopter, as they are quite common. me and my sisters were looking up at it, and i joked that it was a u.f.o. as we passed the southbound poulsbo exit, it began to look odder. it appeared to be more then one light, and it was completely stationary. while i cannot estimate it's exact position as it was night, it appeared to be over the hood canal bridge. if not over the bridge, as it was very far away and in the right direction. it continued to remain stationary the rest of the drive. until i passed the hilltop gas station at the crossroads for tytler rd and nw pioneer way. it then seemed to slowly move eastward away from what was almost certainly the hood canal bridge's general area. at this point it also became completely apparent it was three very bright yellowish lights. if they were connected they would make a triangle shape. it wasn't moving very fast, but definitely moving now and i was absolutely certain it was no longer stationary, and the size appeared very large. once i reached the four corners gas station at the crossroads of big valley rd. i noticed it had a dim, but rapidly flashing strobe between the two lights that framed the back of the triangle. the strobe flashed between red and green rapidly. like some kind of christmas rave dance. it wasn't too bright though and i was wondering if my eyes were deceiving me. at this point it disappeared behind the evergreen trees on my right, that is to the east. this however wasn't my last sighting. i turned onto scenic drive and witnessed the object almost directly above us. it was moving at about 20 mph, and i was certain it was high in the air now as i drove past a very bright barnyard light i've seen illuminate helicopters before... and the lights were very far apart. if i held my arm out at it's maximum length, it would have been about the length of my thumb, about two and a half inches between the \"front\" and the \"back\". this was the last i saw of the object, and the red\\green alternating strobe light (which i will reiterate was flashing very fast.) was definite and my sisters saw it as well. i also thought i made out it's form against the night sky as a large dark triangle shape, with what looked like sharp edges (however i couldn't be certain because the tips of the triangle were where the lights were) i am not sure i actually saw the form though, i could have been just mentally connection the dots between the lights. i also rolled down my window so i could look at it without the windshield at this point as well. it then sped up and moved out towards pope resources land to the east. even as it \"sped\" off, it never achieved a very fast speed, i don't think above a hundred miles per hour. that was the last i saw of it. as a note, the picture i'm attaching has two small pictures on it. the larger one was my view of it when i first turned onto scenic drive, the smaller one was what it looked like about the time i was passing the poulsbo on-ramp. the picture was also drawn about 20 minutes after the event."],"Log Number":"US-12222008-0003","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Washington","Source":"MUFON"}
