I looked up and saw a circle of bright light, as bright as moon. Moving south to north at a high rate of speed. There was no blinking lights, and it was a clear night. Very unusual to see this as I often watch the sky for airplanes coming and going towards the Asheville,north Carolina area far in distance over mountains. I was dumbstruck couldn't turn away .I watched it for approx. 4 to 5 minutes,then it just went away. Never seen anything that bright and round and large that high in sky before. It made me nervous and excited ,and I checked internet for any other witness.nobody will listen or believe me. I know what I have seen,no way that was normal.I have a small business and a family and was in the army, I don't want attention, just answers."],"Longitude":"-86.577197","Tags":"City","Latitude":"35.526151","Summary":"large bright orb high in sky moving very fast over greeneville,tn."}
