I went to EarthCam.com and look at our nations capital. There was a link to a U.S. Park Service camera that had a view from the Netherlands Carillon Looking East. Visual range, according to the camera, is approximately 88 miles. I copied the picture it took to my desktop and when it updated a couple minutes later, the \"effect\" was gone.
