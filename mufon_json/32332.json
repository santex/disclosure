I'm not sure exactly what spot it happened off the top of my head but I was coming from Leawood and it looked to be coming from the left side of the highway. It was before I came to I70 but after the Bannister Rd exit I believe. The lights about 6 or so of them formed like a C - shape in the sky if you were to connect the dots. It proceeded to move across the highway as I got closer and then hovered on the right side of 435 as I passed. As it moved it looked like it changed shape and there were blue lights and white lights. It didn't appear at all to be a plane the shape wasn't like anything I've seen before."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.105876,+-94.573527(32332)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32332) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.573527","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Summary":"On the way home going on 435North almost to kansas city exit and saw a formation of lights in the distance","Latitude":"39.105876","Case Number":"32332","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","City":"Kansas City","trends":["There have been 134 other sightings in Kansas City","There were 9 other sightings in Kansas City on or around October 3rd 2011"]}
