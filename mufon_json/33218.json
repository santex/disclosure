I walked out onto my front porch and saw a bright light appear and then disappear. I ran into the house to get my husband. When I returned, there were no lights. Then, one light appeared, then another. They were not moving. Just bright and stationary. Then they both disappeared after 15 seconds. Meanwhile MANY blinking white lights (jets) moved into the area along with the sound of jets, coming from the direction of Fort Worth, TX. When the large lights disappeared, the jets left in the direction of Ft. Worth, TX. I saw VERY unusual lights before in January of 2010 and ever since I am very conscious of lights in the night sky. I never reported these lights because other people had already reported sightings in Dublin and Stephenville. However, my recollection did not match theirs exactly."],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"32.137107","Region":"Texas","City":"Dublin","Date of the Event":"11/08/2011 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Case Number":"33218","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"very bright light appeared, disappeared, reappeared, then another appeared, both disappeared","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.137107,+-98.418011(33218)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33218) map </A>","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/08/2011 11:39 UTC","Disposition":"IFO"}
