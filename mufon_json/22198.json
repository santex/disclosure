{"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","City":"DeRidder","divs":["Sighting DetailsNote: This event was related to me during the investigation of case #21052. Two witnesses were the mother and daughter. They were driving west on Blankenship Road from De Ridder to go home. They lived just West of De Ridder at the time. When they got near the airport they noticed a silvery metallic object hovering over the hangar of the airport. They turned south on to Airport Road to get a better view. The object was stationary over the hangar and was about 100 feet above the ground. The object was about 40 to 50 feet long and had the shape of a cigar (a cylinder with rounded ends). When they got about even with the object, it began moving east. They turned back east on D street and tried to follow it. The object quickly moved up and out of sight."],"Date of the Event":"07/15/2005 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.846306,+-93.289053(22198)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22198) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22198.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22198.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Sighted a silver metallic cylindrical object hovering over airport","Longitude":"-93.289053","Date Submitted":"03/07/2010 04:58 UTC","Object Shape":"Cigar","Case Number":"22198","Region":"Louisiana","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in DeRidder","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-03072010-0016","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"30.846306"}
