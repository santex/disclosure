I was playing in my backyard, when I heard police sirens and looked through the yard that backed mine to see a police car pull up in front of their house. I then saw movement up and to my left. It appeared to be a classic saucer shaped craft, coming up from the yard. It was silent and took off really fast. I would estimate it at about 20 feet in diameter. I ran into my house and told my mom, who said that I imagined it, and not to tell anyone. Years later, I asked her about it, and she said it was obvious that I had seen something, and that it shook her up. I recall this clearly to this day, and could still draw what I saw."],"Summary":"I've always wondered... what did I see?","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/30/1962 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"40.678989","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10991.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10991.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.678989,+-73.417067(10991)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10991) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/30/1962 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
