{"divs":["Sighting DetailsWas leaving friends house and got about one mile away when I noticed three bright red lights in a staggered horizontal formation about seven hundred feet off the ground. At first it looked like three radio towers of different heights through the tree canopy.As I moved into a clearing I could clearly see them. At first they were moving at about fifty mph.As I reached the clearing they were rapidly accelerating to a speed above two thousand mph. They quickly moved to the south out of sight.No noise during the entire event.Had the feeling I was seeing something not from this planet. Also ten years of naval aviation experience and well informed of what we have and what it looks like in the sky day or night."],"City":"Orlando","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Longitude":"-81.131385","Region":"Florida","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"46473","Summary":"Three horizontally staggered red lights over rural east orlando.","Log Number":"US-03292013-0003","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=28.533559,+-81.131385(46473)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46473) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/28/2013 09:22 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Latitude":"28.533559","Date Submitted":"03/29/2013 12:33 UTC","trends":["There have been 112 other sightings in Orlando","There were no other sightings in Orlando on or around March 28th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46473.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46473.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
