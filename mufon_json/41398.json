{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was just leaving my house to visit a friend, getting ready to drive over the red- covered bridge and happen to look up into the night sky. Before crossing I observed two orange glowing lights that appeared to be hovering over the fairgrounds. When I got over the bridge I pulled over and stepped out of my SUV. What I seen had me speechless. There were 6 glowing orange lights, they were hovering so close together to be normal aircrafts that fly over Bloomsburg. They seemed to move away from each other and two dissapeared for about 10 seconds and just reappeared out of nowhere. But they seemed to be staying within their \"group\". I did a little bit of research in recent UFO sightings in surrounding cities and within the past 2 weeks and there has been 2 other similar sightings on different occasions very close to where I expirenced this. My question is why here why bloomsburg and why now? Please comment if you witnessed anything similar near Bloomsburg, Pa."],"Date Submitted":"08/03/2012 09:50 UTC","Summary":"6 Orange Lights Hover above Bloomsburg, Pa 29 July 2012","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","City":"Bloomsburg","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bloomsburg","There were no other sightings in Bloomsburg on or around July 29th 2012"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.011848,+-76.453826(41398)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41398) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Pennsylvania","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"41398","Latitude":"41.011848","Longitude":"-76.453826","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41398.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41398.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41398.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"07/29/2012 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Circle","Log Number":"US-08032012-0021"}
