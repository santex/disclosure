We stayed at an economy hotel near the beach, in Acapulco. I went out very early in the morning, before sun up, to enjoy the quiet beach, after I was down the beach away I saw a light in the sky , I thought it was a heliocopter as it moved very slowly, but was silent. As it came towards me I looked up to see it better, when it was aboyut 100 yards from me, directly over me, it then shown a bright blue light at me and I could not move. I lost consciousness and woke up, away down the beach after about one hour. My genitals and anus had been molested. I told my wife but did not see a doctor as the issue cleared up after 3 days. I almost had a nervious breakdown."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Acapulco","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering"}
