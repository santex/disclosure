{"Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy girlfriend and I were out front of our home around 11:00 p.m. and I saw an orange light high above us moving from East to West. I said to her look hon I think that might be a satellite. We watched the object go till it disappeared behind a cloud. The object the came out of the cloud moving in the opposite direction (West to East) then changed to a Northwest heading. We were stunned. The very next night we were out around 11:30 p.m. and saw a bright red orange light slowly ascend from behind some trees. I had my camera so I took a picture but my camera didn't want to focus right so the picture doesn't look like what we saw, it looks like a speck in the picture when in reality it was much bigger. 15-20 minutes later I went back out to see if I could see it again and I saw it hovering near the tree line in the opposite direction I saw it 15-20 minutes earlier."],"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"06/28/2013 11:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-77.946235","City":"Snow Shoe","Log Number":"US-06302013-0004","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"48513","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Snow Shoe","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"My girlfriend and I saw an orange light go into a cloud then come out and go in a different direction.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Pennsylvania","Latitude":"41.029218","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.029218,+-77.946235(48513)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48513) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"06/30/2013 12:41 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48513.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48513.html"]}
