The 'disk' had rotating multicoloured lights at it's base, was approximately 400m in diameter and made no sound. I stopped the car and got out to have a closer look. The craft hovering silently, began to move slowly in a Northerly direction. I then got back into the car and proceeded to follow it. Within 3 seconds the craft sped away at lightening speed, no sound, nothing. The incident lasted 3 minutes in total, no one appeared to be in the area. We know it was a UFO, and wish to this day we has a camera to show everyone. It would be great to hear from anyone else in the area who can corroborate our sighting!"],"Country":"Zimbabwe","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Summary":"UFO over Bulawayo (OM's Club)"}
