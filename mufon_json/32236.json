It was boomerang shaped, the color was very hard to decipher I would describe it as being like a hard shear curtain color, hard mist... very hard to describe. It was moving very slow, and levitated in one place for about 5 seconds, moved to the right, then continued to move forward (which would be east from our home) then it was gone. Lost sight once it went east, feelings are indescribable, I was excited, in awe, but dumbfounded."]}
