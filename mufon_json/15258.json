{"Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"02/02/2009 02:45 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Hendersonville","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt about 2:45am EST I had gone outside to smoke a cigarette and I always look at the sky enjoying the stars. Looking West, there was a stationary bright object of flashing lights. I thought at first it was a plane as the lights were red, green and yellow and the airport is nearby, but it never moved or grew larger or smaller. There was no sound and when I've seen planes in that proximity in the past I can hear them. I went back inside as it was cold and thought I'd report it. I have seen this type of object at least once before at about the same time."],"Case Number":"15258","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-02022009-0007","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.320908,+-82.457373(15258)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15258) map </A>","Latitude":"35.320908","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15258.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15258.html"],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Hendersonville","There were no other sightings in Hendersonville on or around February 2nd 2009"],"Date of the Event":"02/02/2009 02:45 UTC","Longitude":"-82.457373","Object Shape":"Star-like","Summary":"Stationary flashing lights.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"North Carolina","Tags":"City","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States"}
