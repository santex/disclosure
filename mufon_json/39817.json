It looked different than anything that we might usually see like and airplane or helicopter, or anything like a shooting star. I told my family to look at it and everyone agreed that it was different. It didn't blink or pulse and it didn't make a noise of any kind. Close to 2 minutes it seemed to slow down and then it started moving upward (ascending) fairly quickly and the bright white light changed to a reddish-orange color right before it vanished."],"Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Case Number":"39817","Longitude":"-96.764313","Date of the Event":"06/25/2012 10:22 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/26/2012 12:29 UTC"}
