I was looking toward the West when I saw what I thought was a very bright star so I went inside to get my binoculars. When I got back out (about 20 seconds later) I couldn't see the star anymore (which I thought was pretty strange) so I sat down in a lawn chair facing the East. I then saw a very bright light traveling South East and I focused my binoculars on it and saw two lights. I observed this object until it got to within about twenty degrees of the horizon when the lights started turning red and eventually disappeared. I would say the total time from when I started observing the object with the binoculars to when it disappeared was 30 seconds. I am a pilot and aircraft mechanic and saw no navigation lights on this object. It was traveling at a very high rate and I think that what I was observing was an exhaust from an object that was leaving the atmosphere."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19648.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19648.html"]}
