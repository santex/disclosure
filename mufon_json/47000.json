At approximately 8:50PM my daughter was saying her goodbyes when over my shoulder she shouted \"Dad What is that.\" I turned around and in a panic I saw at least 100 or so round objects moving left to right slowly without a sound. they were bluish color and in the front most were gathered in a formation. while others were scattered behind some actually floating at the time. then as they proceeded further away the ones that were floating accelerated almost from 0-80MPH in about 1 second or so. It was truly amazing."],"City":"Bethlehem","Latitude":"40.604069","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"03/13/2013 08:50 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.604069,+-75.430302(47000)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47000) map </A>","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47000.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47000.html"],"Log Number":"US-04262013-0010","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Bethlehem","There were no other sightings in Bethlehem on or around March 13th 2013"]}
