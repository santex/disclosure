I noticed a light in the north eastern sky which appeared to be changing colors. I didn't think it was a star or satellite. I've seen this object before in the same direction. It always appears to change colors, red and blue being the most distinct. I waited for a moment for it to travel faster as there are quite a few planes in the area. (St. John's, Newfoundland) It did not appear to be moving, at least not very fast. I went to grab my camera to have a closer look. It appeared to be hovering in a northeastern direction. I initially thought it might be moving with the rotation of the planet as it seemed quite slow. (But as I look out the window now, it has shifted to going upwards higher in the sky. It has already been 3 hours and it's still there). It took a few tries to capture the object on camera at 140X zoom. I captured some slightly shaky but amazing footage of something that appears to be in the shape of a donut, yet it shifts or morphs into triangles and hexagons and various other shapes. It continued changing color from red, blue, white, yellow, pink, and green."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Summary":"color changing donut changing shapes","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Other","Case Number":"42845","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in St John's","There were no other sightings in St John's on or around September 26th 2012"],"City":"St John's","Latitude":"47.564941","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Chevron, Circle, Diamond, Oval, Sphere, Star-like, Other","Country":"Canada","Log Number":"CA-09262012-0023","Longitude":"-52.710472","Date of the Event":"09/26/2012 07:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Newfoundland and Labrador","Sighting Duration":"03:00:00"}
