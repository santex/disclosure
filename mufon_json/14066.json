Slowly and quickly zooming back and forth in the sky. As I was walking outside to check on my horses I looked up and saw flashing lights in the distance. I watched it for a while, then looked back minutes later and the same one was still there. At one time there were two near each other. I thought they were planes but the same ones were moving back and forth in the sky, and had two different obvious speeds, one very fast, and then very slow. I went back inside and soon lost interest and lost sight. I didn't have a camera on me."],"Tags":"City","Summary":"Flashing many colors, zooming back and forth in the sky.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14066.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14066.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"14066","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"42.688953","Date of the Event":"11/25/2008 08:45 UTC"}
