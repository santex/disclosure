{"Summary":"huge dark gray blimp like object just above tree line","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-88.12272","Date of the Event":"04/03/2007 05:10 UTC","Region":"Illinois","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approx 5:10pm I was driving east on palatine road approaching ELA from BARRINGTON RD in Hoffman Estates. I witnessed a pretty big blimp like object just above the tree line. It appeared to be at ELA and PALATINE ROAD .I could also see aircraft above it. I drove faster to get a better view of it and as I got to ELA ROAD it disappeared. I really would love to know if there were any other sightings of this it seemed sooo big and soo stationary. If you were driving in the same direction as myself I really don't see how you could miss it. There were plenty of cars out as it was rush hour. I did not notice anyone else looking up but I sure was. When I say it disappeared I mean as I got closer the view above the tree's got less and less, obviously, I turned around after making a right on ELA and drove back to where I initally spotted it which was a JEWEL strip mall and I could not see anything there. It either landed or vanished I have no idea.
