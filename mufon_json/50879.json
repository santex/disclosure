Before I could shut my eyes I noticed what looked like a plane because of the flashing colors. The more I concentrated on it the less I thought it was a plane. It came forwards towards me a steady speed but then just as quickly went back at the same steady speed. It changed colors multiple times(blue, white, orangish, red twinkle). It then proceeded to move side to side. At first I thought it was just a weird star event but when it moved towards my house in bed I became startled. I woke my girlfriend up to look at it as well so I could confirm I wasn't crazy. I would have watched longer but I had to get ready for work. I lost sight of the object when I went downstairs to get ready. I tried to take a video with my girlfriends phone but I captured nothing."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50879.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50879.html"],"Region":"Ontario","Source":"MUFON"}
