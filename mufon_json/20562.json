Got a drink of water and on the way back to bed I looked out the south facing window and saw a low hovering circle of red and white lights. The lights were spinning counter-clockwise, and my first thought was that they were the lights of a tow truck (being from the city) and then instantly I realized that I was in the middle of nowhere - no tow trucks - not even any real roads. I was fascinated and stood watching out the window for about a minute or so and then that same area went completely dark. I was not afraid, but rather felt like I was observing something secret; that the \"people\" thought they were safe from prying eyes and they weren't. There was no noise...they were just there and then gone."],"Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Westcliffe","There were no other sightings in Westcliffe on or around September 19th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"None"}
