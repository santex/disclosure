So we waited until night and went up on the roof of our house to look for the UFO. We didnt expect to see anything we were just doing it for fun. Around 11 that night we both saw a very large black triagle shape in the sky. It made no sound and was very, VERY low. It almost seemed to go just over the top of the tree in the neighbors front yard. we watched it float away for about 12 to 15 min. We've talked about the incedent a few times over the years but just laughed it off. It wasent until I saw a episode of UFO Hunters and saw that these UFOs have been reported all over the world. I just wanted to get this on recored in case there is something to all this."],"Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-95.683418","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"39.058584","Log Number":"US-01042009-0012","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14735.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14735.html"],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Topeka","There were no other sightings in Topeka on or around May 31st 1987"]}
