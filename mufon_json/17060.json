{"Country":"United States","Longitude":"-84.978669","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was early in the morning and I was running along the riverwalk, getting some excercise. I saw a teardropped shaft craft rise up out of the Chatahoochee River to the right and hover for a few moments. It didn't stay there for long, but it was silver in color and looked smooth, with water still running off of it. The crafted rotated so that the \"tip\" of the teardrop was pointing towards the sky, at which point it just shot straight up into the air at a very high speed."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.466246,+-84.978669(17060)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17060) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/08/1984 02:00 UTC","Latitude":"32.466246","Weather Factors":"None, Does Not Apply","Date Submitted":"03/08/1984 02:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17060.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17060.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Craft rose out of the water and shot into the sky.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"17060","Object Shape":"Teardrop","City":"Columbus","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Georgia","trends":["There have been 22 other sightings in Columbus","There were no other sightings in Columbus on or around March 8th 1984"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-05222009-0007"}
