Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"09/21/2007 09:00 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsi live in a apt. complex of several buildings wrapped around a decent sized lake. it was around 9 pm my girlfriend who lives with me on the northern side of the lake was with her friend who was moving in a building on the direct opposite side of the lake. i was in our apt feeding our 4 month old son when my girlfriends friend called me on my cell phone freaking out about some lights in the sky. at first i didnt believe her because she always would give me grief about my interest in the topic until i heard my girlfriend in the background freaking out yelling \"its getting closer\". understand my girfriend is a very grounded person who before hand never believed in any of this stuff and didnt joke around like that so when i heard her i immediately ran outside with my son still in my arms looking in the sky. at first i didnt see anything at all and i asked her friend who was still on the phone with me where it was at and she said to look to my left. when i still didnt see anything i started walking towards the lake thinking that the building i lived in was blocking whatever it was. as i was walking backwards looking up all the sudden i see several small fire red perfectly round shaped objects zipping upwards over our complex. i couldnt believe what i was seeing at first because of how fast they were moving. it reminded me of insects buzzing around the sky. so as im watching these red objects i had completly forgot about still being on the phone (i had a bluetooth earpeice) when i heard her friend yelling what the hell is that. i turned around to see what else she could be possibly talking about and saw what looked like a small jet but it had no red or blue blinking lights but one large pulsing white light almost like a strobe light flying directly torwards these red objects in an almost s like pattern. the objects started flying off towards the east over interstate 75 it was almost like this jet was herding them off and suddenly they zipped strait up into these low overcast clouds that were hanging over that area to the east and the clouds turned bright red for a moment and then just faded. again i forgot i was still on the phone until i heard \"where they go\" in my ear but i could still see this plane flying directly over the tree line from my point of view for a moment then that too i lost site of so i asked her friend if she could see it from where they were on the other side of the lake and she said yes so i started walking around the lake torwards where they were standing to get a better view. they were on higher ground than i was. as i was walking over there i heard her say \"theres 3 of them that just came back down\" and i saw nothing at first because i was right next to the line of trees that was blocking my view but i caught a glimpse of one of them through the trees so i stopped to watch and then it took off to where i couldnt see it anymore so i asked her friend if they were still seeing it and she said yes but they were flying off towards the east and the plane (jet) was chasing after them again. so as im walking over still holding my son i start to see other people running by me shouting in spanish obviously freaked out and then the closer i got to the clearing by the other buildings i saw alot of people standing around shouting about what was going on. there was one man standing on his balcony yelling out \"please tell me im not the only one who just saw that\" and right about then i was approaching where my girlfriend and her friend were standing. i ran up and handed my girlfriend our son and climbed up a swingset to see if i could see anything from a higher point but by that time everything was gone. later when things kinda calmed down i asked them what exactly they saw from the point before i saw anything and they told me that at the first moment of seeing anything it was a big triangle of white balls. my girlfriend told me it looked like a glowing pearl neclace in a triangle form and she then said it started in formation doing a figure 8 fomation when all the sudden it in her words \"exploded into several fire balls. that is the point my sighting of it started. we had several cop cars around our complex afterwards and i approached one and asked if they were called there because of the sightings and the cop i spoke to said in a sarcastic way \"yeah people were calling in about strange lights out here\". he then told me they were supposed to tell people to calm down and it was the blueash airshow that was taking place the following day out practicing their flights. i immediatly thought that was bunk unless they were goin to reveal some aircraft not known to any public. i watched the news that night and saw nothing about it but the following day on local 12 news they said people in blueash which is to the east of us reported on strange lights. they showed a newsman interviewing a witness and he said he saw 3 objects that looked like flaming marshmellows flying around. the anchorman then said they contacted blueash airport to see what they knew about it and said they knew nothing. it wasnt them out there. the anchorman then started humming the theme to close encounters in a joking way to make fun of the story and that was all i heard after that. if there werent all those other people who saw it that day i wouldve thought my mind was just blowing things outta proportion but i know what airplanes are capable of doing. at least ones that are known about to the public. all in all there were probably 20 people here who saw it. the thing that bothers me is all the time it was going on i had a camera\\video camera phone in my pocket and never once thought to grab it and get pictures. now i know why the footage you do see isnt any good because nobodys thinking of any thing while theyre witnessing something like that until its over you think i shouldve grabbed my camera!!!!!"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-03162008-0006","Sighting
