She said the object she and my dad saw when I was 6 was circular with white lights all the way around it. It was hovering 10 to 12 stories over the electrical sub-station.(about 100 to 120 feet) The lightning that came out of it towards the electrical sub-station was red and green. She said she remembered these colors because it reminded her of Christmas. It went up in the sky quite a distance then went out into space at an angle very rapidly. Also she couldn't tell the color of the craft because she said it was very dark. Hope you have a good day..."],"trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Mobile","There was one other sighting in Mobile on or around July 31st 2006"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"30.704147"}
