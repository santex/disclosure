It was stationary for approximately 10 seconds. I blinked my eyes and looked again and it had an oval appearance, when I looked up again it completely disappeared. I was driving to DIA at the time of this sighting and was about one mile away on Pena Blvd. I know it was not an airplane or a helicopter. I was very excited to see such an unusual object. It was a clear blue sky as well.
