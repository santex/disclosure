At first I thought they must be airplanes but after watching them for a little bit they did not move. This had me confused so I went and got my husband at first he thought they were airplanes but when he saw they were not moving he was just as confused as I was. We watched them for about an hour then noticed that they were moving. Not alot just slightly and in random directions. I thought maybe my eyes were playing tricks so I used the power lines to gauge them and they were really moving. I was a little scared so I went back to bed. I'm not sure what it was but I do know that it was not like anything I have ever seen"],"Log Number":"US-09092012-0018","Region":"Oklahoma","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
