{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on our dock in the evening. It was dark but the sky was clear. I saw a light coming from across the lake a bright clear light. Planes never fly our way from the airport and I thought it looked strange. I called for my husband to come out just as he got to the dock the thing flew over the top of us. It was huge darkened the sky above looked like a triangle with three white lights on the bottom of it that did not shine out. We had to lay our heads back to see the bottom of it, no sound slow moving low in the sky headed off right over the top of the trees never picking up it's speed. It came from the northwest. That same summer before we had seen the big ship. I was laying in the lawn chair about 1:00 pm nice sunny day, for some reason opened my eyes and looked up and saw three small flying objects looked like hang gliders but they were all black and I saw no one flying them. They were completely silent and just above the trees."],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Date Submitted":"07/31/1990 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-11262008-0013","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Rhinelander","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/31/1990 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-89.412075","Country":"United States","Region":"Wisconsin","Latitude":"45.636623","Summary":"Flying triangle large dark flying slowly over the top of our dock.","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Rhinelander","There were no other sightings in Rhinelander on or around July 31st 1990"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14060.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14060.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"14060","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.636623,+-89.412075(14060)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14060) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
