When I got home I sat down for about 15min. Then I drove up to the convenient store when I got to the store the light was still there so I sat there for awhile and watched it. It was moving back and forth from east to west and the blinking light was changing it's blinking pattern all the time it was not consistent. I stayed there for about 10 min then went home. When I got home I grab the kids and my sister and a pair of binoculars and we went to go see it. You cant see it from my house there are too many trees. We went back on the main road and it was still there. I parked the car in a parking lot and we looked at it with the binoculars and it seemed to have many lights at least 5. It started to go north in the sky so we tried to follow it but it disappeared."],"Case Number":"26888","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26888.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26888.html"],"City":"Pinellas Park","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Pinellas Park","There were no other sightings in Pinellas Park on or around December 7th 2010"],"Object Shape":"Flash, Triangle","Latitude":"27.845442","Sighting Duration":"00:40:00","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.845442,+-82.691044(26888)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26888) map </A>","Longitude":"-82.691044","Date Submitted":"12/07/2010 11:07 UTC","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering"}
