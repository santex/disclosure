{"City":"Washburn","Case Number":"40931","Summary":"large triangle ufo moving from north to south at very slow speed in circles, one above it stationary, at final location where it stopped and circled over and over","divs":["Sighting DetailsI have seen this object before, usualy hovering at a high altitude and stationary, and usually sighting it in the same general area. i regularly watch this object and am an avid skywatcher at night. the thing that caught my eye last night was that the triangle object was not in its regular spot i usually notice it in, and that its altitude was much lower then normal when veiwing this object. i watched this large triangle shaped object travel in an odd circular pattern, almost as if it was searching for something, it taveled in a north to southern direction, and traveled maybe 5 miles over a two hour period, comming closer towards my home, almost directly across from where i live. it continued to move at low altitude, completely silent, and in a circular pattern and remained in the general area until daylight and seemed to go directly upwards untill it was out of sight, at that time i noticed there appeared to be another triangle above it at a much higher altitude, and as daylight came it also went straight up untill out of sight. these craft are extremely huge, no red or orange lights, but three distinct yellow lights emiting from the bottom of the craft and the outline of the triangle had small yellow lights all the way around it, very bright, no noise whatsoever, and moved at a snails pace, even when they went straight up and out of sight. very odd to say the least, and i can only say that it appeared to be searching for something, i have never seen this object that low, and moving that slow, slow enough that it should have fallen out of the sky. now there is more to this sighting, but i am not sure i wish to share this at this time, and one of the main reasons i say that it appeared to be searching for something. id love to hear if anyone else seen this object over the general area. something very strange is going on over washburn maine and the surrounding areas, and has anyone actually witnessed more then just this massive triangle? any disturbinces on the ground? UPDATE: as soon as i can get some feedback on what i might have seen in this area i will explain further the additional anomilies i witnessed on the ground, i just went and investigated the field across from my house, which is a large field of grass, with a few 4wheeler trails the neighbors use to go dump brush down by the tree line, now other then my neighbor, i have never seen anyone in this field, and in the year i have lived here i have only seen one deer in this field, but noted that there is random trails in this field that were not there before, and im not saying it couldnt be animals, but if they were they would have had to been large where as i noted, upper stocks and grass broken at the top, and the grass is ruffly three to four feet tall, not to mention i have a clear view of this field and would notice rather easily if any deer or moose where in the area, so i dont beleive that a smaller animal could cause this. now if i can get some feedback on what i seen in the air last night, then id be willing to further explain what i had witnessed on the ground during the time this triangle was circling above, now im a very rational person, highly educated and can usuly come up with an explanation for things, but this one i cant, and to say the least if what i witnessed what i think i did, then this field would be the place any ETs would check out, where as at least ten people have heard and witnessed some very strange sounds comming form this field, and for the last four or five months none of us have been able to explain it, just totally strange in itself, and has us all baffled, then witnessing a ufo circling the general area, and then the bizarre occourance that happened during this ufo sighting, has me baffled, intrigued, and an overwhelming feeling to find out more, even at the questioning of my sanity, and what i seen last night is why i am holding back on disclosing what happened on the ground while i witnessed these two odd triangle shaped craft, please if anyone has seen a simliar event id like to hear about it."],"Longitude":"-68.214597","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Washburn","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.807598,+-68.214597(40931)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40931) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Flash, Triangle, Other","Date Submitted":"07/19/2012 05:20 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"07/19/2012 01:00 UTC","Latitude":"46.807598","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40931.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40931.html"],"Sighting Duration":"04:00:00","Region":"Maine","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07192012-0015"}
