I am no photographer and only have a Cannon power shot A590. It was on the default settings but I had moved the dial to \"Night Scene\" I took several pictures over the course of an hour. I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary while I was outside. I also had binoculars and did not see this object when looking through them and I think I would of noticed it. I'm sure I would of been very excited to see it actually. I saw the 2 stars when I was looking through the camera but I did not see this. Anyway the first picture I took also included this round thing above the moon. Maybe it was something on the lens? But it didn't show up on any of the other pictures and at no time while I was out side did I clean the lens. I was hoping you might be able to tell me what it is, and if not, will then you have another picture of something unidentified to add to your collection. Thanks for all you do."],"Latitude":"61.711389","Object Shape":"Circle","Sighting Duration":"00:00:01","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21422.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/21422_submitter_file1__IMG_0355.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21422.html"],"Summary":"I was taking pictures of the moon.","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Alaska","Log Number":"US-01092010-0016","Date of the Event":"12/31/2009 10:12 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"21422","Date Submitted":"01/09/2010 11:24 UTC","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","City":"Sutton-Alpine","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-148.894167","Disposition":"Unknown"}
