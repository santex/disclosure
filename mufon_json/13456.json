It was like they were blinking like this: * then ** then *** ***** ****** and then blank, and it would start back at one light again. I've never seen anything similar to this, it made no sound and moved slowly; not what I'd expect from a UFO. Could you please confirm this sighting or tell me that you received no other reports, just let me know either way."],"Region":"California","City":"San Mateo","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"37.567612","Case Number":"13456","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date Submitted":"10/31/2008 09:30 UTC","Country":"United States"}
