{"Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Eastern Kentucky","Case Number":"3866","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was on a friend's property stepping off his front porch... The sound made me aware of the object I thought the object at first was a KC-10 Extender of the US Air Force, but there were no red marker lights on the wings and no white marker lights on wing tips or tail. The object was a circular white light when compared to the stars. It dwarfed the stars. It was going straight with noise behind it and started a gentle curver from South to Southeast. My reaction during it was to try to understand weather it was or was not a UFO...After seeing the object I could not identify the object. I lost sight of the object when the object's light went dark and blended with the dark sky. It was a totally clear night sky and there were no objects obstructing my view."],"Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Bright white object bet 35k & 70k feet with deep roar sounding like rocketry but not sounding like space shuttle","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"09/19/2005 08:40 UTC","Log Number":"US-09192005-0007","Latitude":"37.5163","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Eastern Kentucky","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Longitude":"-82.805985","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3866.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3866.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Region":"Kentucky","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.5163,+-82.805985(3866)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3866) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/19/2005 08:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
