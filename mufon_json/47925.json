Seconds later bright light coming from n to south just in front of house. Disappeared then reappeared a second later as if it stopped for two seconds then after passing in front of th house I could see the shape of the object and a dull light reviling a round object. It terrified my non believing wife who usually criticisms me perfusaly now will tell you the whole story. I have two more story's and a clip from two more encounters the the following nights that will make your skin crawl. The video of the orange light brighter than a street light was caught on my phone camera but never showed up after reviewing the recording....I'm just amazed at all the activity going on here in little ol boise and am now a full on believer!"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.607123"}
