{"Longitude":"-91.829243","divs":["sighting detailsthis report is to offer some corroboration to a sighting reported from alaska report 28055. that same type ufo was reported and photographed by a gentleman in namibia and also over new hampshire reported on 9\\27\\2010. i personally saw the same type object hovering over bryant, arkansas in 2009. i don'remember the exact date. i had just been to the walmart in bryant and was driving west on the service road i happened to look to my right and saw the same type object hovering over the highway 5 area i drove under an overpass and pulled off ino an open area beside the service road. i parked my truck and jumped out with binoculars to look at the object, which i estmate was only 1000 to 1500 ft. agl. but the object was gone. it took less than a minute to pull over and stop i proceeded west again on the service road planing to turn around at the spring hill over pass and cross backover i-30 to go east on the service road to my home,. but, as i started across the spring hill over pass, i happened to look to my right and could see the same object hovering just to the right of i-30, again at approx 1000-1500 agl. i pulled over and observed the object with my binocs. it appeared to be hovering, but as i watched it began slowly descending until the object disappeared behind a tree line in the distance.i then, for some unknown reason, got back in my truck and went home. which is totally a mystery to me as why i did that. hindsight says i should have jumped back in my truck and roared on to that treeline. but i didn't and still regret i did not the sky was a besutiful blue and completely cloudless. bryant is at exit 123 on interstate 30 and the treeline that the object disappeared behind is at exit 114. from the time i first noticed the object and pulled over to look at it it was less than a minute. the elapsed time for my travel to the springhill overpass was less than 2 minutes. in that time, total 3 minutes, the object moved 9 miles you can figure its speed from that. when i saw the namibia picture i realized that was the same type object the same for the new hampshire sighting i copied the nh ufo and am inluding that pic with this report. i do not have a copy of the namibia picture. it should be in the cms data base"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"in reference to report 28055 that ufo seen in multiple locations","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Arkansas","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28061.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/28061_submitter_file1__namibiaufoinnewhampshire.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28061.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/31/2009 05:00 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-03032011-0005","Latitude":"35.20238","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.20238,+-91.829243(28061)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28061) map </A>","Case Number":"28061","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball","trends":[""],"Date Submitted":"03/03/2011 01:45 UTC"}
