{"Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Luna Pier","Region":"Michigan","Object Features":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsmy name is [cms\\tg\\pid] and i live in toledo ohio. some years back i was shown a place called the secret beach where the fishing was supposed to be the best and the waters warm and clean. since then i have been going to this place often to retreat with my family or to have alone time with my self away from the city. since i have been going to this place i have seen things that i have kept to myself due to the \"enviroment\" that i live in. talking about aliens and ufos may cause me great harm. anyway, on the day i would like to report, i went to the beach with about 6 friends and some of our kids. while on the beach you can see several islands in the distance, and one of my friends noticed something like a blimp hanging in the air above one of them. as we all stared at what we thought was a bright white blimp when one of my friends yelled -[cms\\tg\\pd] this bro that [cms\\tg\\pd] is rotating! we all watched this thing hang above the island for about 20 mins then we all heard the rumble of jets and the thing was gone. we never saw any jets. we did watch a large group of birds fly off the island while this thing was floating above because i remember making a joke about it. located directly on the beach is some sort of plant that uses the water and sends it back out at a high temp. there is also the nuclear plant in eyes distance, im not sure if thats what is attracting them or what. there is something there. me and my girlfriend also seen them going into the water right in front of us."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06012010-0001","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-83.442433","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Luna Pier","This sighting has never been favorited."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23570.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23570.html"],"Date Submitted":"06/01/2010 01:11 UTC","Object Shape":"Blimp, Cylinder, Oval","Tags":"City","Case Number":"23570","Summary":"[cms/tg/pid]","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"41.806991","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.806991,+-83.442433(23570)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23570) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/29/2010 12:00 UTC"}
