Everybody is looking skyword at fireworks. Jim says What is That! I turned and looked at a bright red light approaching from approx. 15 Degrees from the North East. I said It's a UFO! I saw the same red light 2 years earlier twice in one night. At the same time 2 years ago, a jet liner at about 32-35,000 ft. gave me a way to measure the approx. altitude! I estimated that because the aparent speed resembled a jet liner, this vehical had to be traveling Mach 5 at 100,000 Ft. I am so glad I had my camera with me. Now I try to keep it with me at all times, you never know? You might see BIGFOOT!!!"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/07/2013 07:24 UTC","Object Shape":"Chevron","Date of the Event":"07/04/2013 11:20 UTC"}
