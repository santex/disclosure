So bright it illuminated by room like a full moon. After stationery 2 minutes three red lights appeared in triangular formation and object appeared to rotate 2.5 times to the north with plane of triangle perpendicular to the ground. After rotating it suddenly vanished. Clear night no clouds. I was so astonished. It was real not an effect or something ambiguous. Very tangible. Very clear cut. I was stunned that I was actually witnessing this thing."],"Region":"California","Case Number":"33759","Date of the Event":"11/16/2011 12:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33759.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33759.html"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Triangle","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-12012011-0018","Date Submitted":"12/01/2011 08:55 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None"}
