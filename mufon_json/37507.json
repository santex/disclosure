I looked up and saw a circular disk with four spikes and a red spot above the powerlines in the sky above me. At first we though it was an odd-shaped balloon but we noticed it had no string and balloons don't have spikes. As we watched, the UFO moved up and down while hovering and was ascending at the same time.It got very high into the sky, making it appear star like. It hovered across for maybe 50 seconds which is when we filmed the object as it moved sideways. We stopped filming and approximately 10 seconds afterwards the object ascended straight up allowing us to make out its shape. The event left us shocked and confused. We lost sight of the object as it rose at a medium rate into the sky."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Sydney","Latitude":"-33.942283","Log Number":"AU-04162012-0007","Date of the Event":"04/15/2012 04:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
