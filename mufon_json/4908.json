Occasionally I can see it with the naked eye but it appears and disappears quickly. Only once in the past 2 years have I been able to be quick enough to photograph it while actually viewing it through the viewfinder. One other time it stayed visible about 8 months ago long enough for me to catch it in front of a plane and then behind the plane before it disappeared. I had the plane and the object in the same photo so there is no mistaking the object being the same object. I have all these old photos saved if case anyone would be interested. I am enclosing the original and one enlargement."],"Longitude":"-77.93912","Date Submitted":"06/07/2006 10:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Object appears and disappears"}
