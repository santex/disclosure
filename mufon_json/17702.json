{"Date Submitted":"06/24/2009 03:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","City":"Grayson","divs":["Sighting DetailsWas driving west on I-64 when suddenly 2 low-flying F-22s fighter jets (?, unsure but similar to photos of jets) flying low and fast burst from the mountains overhead. They were headed south west towards Louisville. Very unusual in this area. I read about the Louisville UFO event the next day and felt these may have been connected. The jets could have come from Langeley in Va., but that's speculation from me. They were going awfully low and fast, making sharp turns over the hills and could just have been headed to Fort Campbell but they seemed to be on an emergency of sorts."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17702.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17702.html"],"Log Number":"US-06282009-0006","Region":"Kentucky","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"38.332581","Case Number":"17702","Longitude":"-82.948502","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"F-22 jets spotted following UFO event in Louisville","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.332581,+-82.948502(17702)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17702) map </A>","Date of the Event":"06/24/2009 03:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Grayson","There were no other sightings in Grayson on or around June 24th 2009"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
