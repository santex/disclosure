Looked up at the sky to stargaze for a moment. Looking east. I then turned around still looking up a perfectly round ball slowly moving over trees in backyard. Lasted 10 seconds. Looked like a harvest moon. I would say the size of a basketball at arms length. The trees it went behind were about 50 yards away and somewhere around 50' tall."]}
