plus, when it took off from visiting my friend's and me, there was not a sound of acceleration. we made a promise to each other not to tell anyone about our \"ufo\" experience. but, this is something you just can never forget, and since that day i have known for sure that there are \"et's\" out there watching and studying us. the only people that i have divulged this information to is my immediate family (until now), and you may think that i am just another person trying to get a little attention, but i'm sure that if you investigated this \"close encounter\" with the \"sheppard air force base\" radar record's back during that time period, and also the (kswo) tv station's record's; you will believe me. however, everything that i have stated in this letter to you; (is the truth and nothing but the truth so help me god). you know, i know a polygraph isn't a 100 percent tool for getting the to the truth, but i would even agree to be given \"scopolamine or thiopental sodium\", this is my prof to you that all i've stated in this report to you is the truth. may god bless us all"]}
