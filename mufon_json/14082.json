I was about 3 miles west of Clarksville on sr 20, I noticed a flash of low intensity light, orange in color, just above the tree tops. While driving I concentraited on where I had last seen the light and it flashed again, the light lasted about 2 to 3 tenths of a second on each duration. I noticed that each time the light came on it moved westward about 50 to 100 feet or so. I watched it for about a minute until I drove past it's position. There was no sound that I could hear as the engine of my truck was loud. The lights looked exactly like :U: It looked like a large U with two lights on each side of the U.
