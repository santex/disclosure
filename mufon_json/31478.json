For some reason I looked outside directly at the object. Starred for about 10 secs and asked my client to also look at the object which soon disappeared in thin air after or acknowledgment. I knew right away it was a UFO. It floated in the air lightly rocking left to right.. disappeared.. then appeared again when i drew attention to my friend.. then disappeared after we starred. During the sighting I yelled omg jessica is that a UFO then she also looked out the window as well as i did to observe and then started tearing up at the eyes.. Felt sick to my stomach during and after, so did my client..& still feel sick every time talking about it. I lost sight because it vanished."],"Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Elizabeth","There were no other sightings in Elizabeth on or around September 2nd 2011"]}
