I just happened to go to the balcony of our condo because I could hear people at the pool yelling. I saw several objects in the sky to the North that were extremely bright. I asked my wife to come quickly, she arrived just as the lights went out. I could see people at the pool area looking to the sky and seeing the same thing. The night was very clear and the moon was in front of our condo. The lights appeared again just under the moon, as soon as one went out another appeared as if in a line. Again they went out and appeared this time in a line and very brilliant in the sky which is now South East. They again flash out and appear shortly afterwards lower in the sky which is now North East. This time they were in a line, shining brilliantly and lit the ocean."],"Case Number":"43615","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
