{"divs":["Sighting DetailsStanding under a tree at a car show, I noticed a white light filling most of the spaces in a tree above me(1). as it passed the tree into view it was a large square appearing 2 dimensional above the lit parking lot. It was divided into 4 sections by a thin partition seeming non luminescent like a window frame(2). The object glowed like an x-ray viewing board. Because it appeared 2 dimensional its size was not immediately apparent, however it was on a steady heading at a steady speed(3). Its course was heading from Oxford to Trumbull along route 111. At this time it was apparently 4 to 5 times the tree level and the area of a two football fields traveling between 50 and 100mph. I was still able to see it as it diminished to a dot on the horizon(4). Until now I have had no place worth reporting this incident too, aside from a few classified add looking for others who saw it. I do believe in Mufon's purpose after having viewed the sight and I hope this report can fill in a blank somewhere."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Region":"Connecticut","Log Number":"US-07252008-0017","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around July 1st 1995","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"41.336111","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Longitude":"-73.225833","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11734.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11734.html"],"Object Features":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.336111,+-73.225833(11734)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11734) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"square, white luminescent, divided like window","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date of the Event":"07/01/1995 07:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"11734","City":"Monroe","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/01/1995 07:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
