Noticed a orange light 30-35 deg. from horizon from the NW. I pulled over noticing the strange light was coming towards my position this was for about 45-60 sec. in time. Watched it pass over my point of direction North. Had no idea what it was. First thought might be an EMS helicopter. Absolutely no sound on a calm and clear night. The orange sphere had fuzzy border looked like it might be on fire, hard to describe maybe slightly flickering in intensity. As it past me from left to right it was heading in a straight line to the SE. I noticed the retreating side had what looked like a flickering spider web appearance in combination with the orange glowing sphere. It's retreat was 10-15 sec. before it disappeared into the sky. Turned to carry on my way, caught second sphere at my 11 o'clock and watched it retreat in similar fashion, only it seemed to be faster. I felt exhilarated, yet I was wishing for a pair of binoculars because of the fuzziness and the spider web appearance. I went home told my wife, sat outside for 5 min. Then went to bed."],"Case Number":"42826","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-91.609326","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.741514,+-91.609326(42826)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42826) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","City":"North Liberty","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-09262012-0005","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","Region":"Iowa","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"09/26/2012 03:10 UTC"}
