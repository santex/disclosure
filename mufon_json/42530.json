To my surprise I found a couple shots that blew me away.Two of the photos were caught within 10 mins of each other and the dark one I actually saw it in my camera view finder but unable to see with the naked eye. I also captured many small shiney orbs but lets stick to the big ones first. The first photo the object is on the upper left above tree,you must zoom in on these photos to see them with clarity.The second photo shows a disc passing by the hydro pole,the third photo I was actually able to see in view finder but when I tried to take another photo I could not find anywhere in sky. I've come to realize that the sky is swarming with different crafts but the naked eye is unable to see but the camera is able to catch them. I'm interested to know if anyone has ever seen the first UFO before.Thanks Pete"],"Object Features":"Wings"}
