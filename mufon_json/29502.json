We pulled over on 3300 South near 2000 East in the East Milcreek suburb of Salt Lake City. We watched as the objects, which were very bright, moved slowly from West to East, slowly formed triangles and then one by one disappeared. We attempted to take video but armed only with our camera phones, were left with a poor quality end product. We were able to snap two pictures - one of all the lights which looks like the end of a firework and the other of the \"triangle\" shape."],"trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Salt Lake City","There were no other sightings in Salt Lake City on or around June 11th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.768189,+-111.888597(29502)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29502) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"06/11/2011 10:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"06/12/2011 03:49 UTC","Summary":"large group of slow moving objects go into triangle formation and disappear","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29502.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29502_submitter_file1__saltlakelights.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29502_submitter_file2__SLCUFOTRIANGLE.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29502.html"],"Object Features":"None, Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-111.888597","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Fireball, Triangle","Region":"Utah","City":"Salt Lake City"}
