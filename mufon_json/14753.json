{"Object Shape":"Flash","Case Number":"14753","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsIt was in the 50's outside, around 8pm, and the skies were clear as could be. Me, my daughter and her father were arriving at his home from my own, I got my daughter out of the car and was holding her hand as we walked towards the house, about that time a bright bluish white flash of light lit up everything around us, we could not see anything when it happened, after it went away a few of the street lights were out for about 5 minutes and my head began to hurt. My daughter is 3 and she keeps saying she lost us, I'm not sure if she means she couldn't see us when it happened because I was holding her hand the whole time. I then took her inside and stayed outside for a little while just to see if anything else was going to happen, the dogs up and down the street were all barking and my own dog was whining with hair standing on end. It made me feel really uneasy and wierd because I'm not sure what happened, and when I try to tell anyone about it, its hard to explain because I'm not sure what it was."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"Virginia","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Portsmouth","There were no other sightings in Portsmouth on or around January 4th 2009"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Portsmouth","Summary":"Bright blue and white flash of light.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.842686,+-76.295654(14753)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (14753) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"01/04/2009 08:00 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14753.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14753.html"],"Date Submitted":"01/04/2009 08:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-01042009-0030","Latitude":"36.842686","Longitude":"-76.295654","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
