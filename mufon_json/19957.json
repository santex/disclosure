Something told me to look up, and I saw what appeared to be Jet racing across the sky, but directly above the jet something caught my eye. It was round, (not good in directions) headed south (?)and flying right over the jet which was headed West , it was moving very slow. As I was approaching the entrance of the Hospital I kept looking up unitl it went over the Hospital which then it blocked my view. But something interesting happended. As I stood there, I was just looking up to see if I could still see it, it returned and I got spooked because at this time it just hovered in the sky and stood there for a minute or so,(as if directly right above me -Almost) I just kept looking at it, there were other people there but no one bothered to look up. As I kept looking at it, it began to once again, begin the same course it was taking earlier and went 'south' bound and was gone. It was round, whitish metallic in color, slow moving but manuvered back and forth....this has not been my only sighting. I have kept silent for years its about my 4-5 fifth sighting in the last 20 years with one \"possibel\" abudcution experience when I was in College....and one contact via telepathy from a being who asked me to write 11 Points of Wisdom. I wrote them down and have shared it with very few people....Whats going on?"],"Summary":"UFO flying over a jet","Log Number":"US-10152009-0011","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Region":"New York","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","trends":["There have been 579 other sightings in New York","There were no other sightings in New York on or around October 3rd 2009"],"Latitude":"40.717353","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.717353,+-74.004853(19957)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19957) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19957.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19957.html"],"Longitude":"-74.004853","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
