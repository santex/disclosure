{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Latitude":"38.982025","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I went outside in front of our home at approximately 6:30pm Saturday, February 6th, 2010 to finish shoveling snow. I picked up a scoop of snow with my shovel and turned around to throw it over our fence and when I did, I saw two round lights hovering in the northeast, towards Annapolis, MD going very slowly and close together. I said to my husband, \"what the heck is that!\" They were two bright round yellow circles. If you were looking at a clock, one was at 10 o'clock and one was at 5o'clock, but very close together. We watched them for approximately 30 seconds. Then, one of the lights turned off and then the other and then they were gone. It reminded me of the lights over Phoenix how they went out, but here there were only two lights. I know these lights were not planes. There was no noise. I have never seen anything like this. My heart was racing and I could feel the adrenaline pumping. We were outside until about 7:40pm and didn't see anything else."],"Region":"Maryland","Date Submitted":"02/06/2010 08:41 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.982025,+-76.489323(21796)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21796) map </A>","Weather Factors":"None, Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Log Number":"US-02062010-0010","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21796.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21796.html"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Shoveling snow, turned around and saw two lights in the northeast sky.","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle, Unknown","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-76.489323","Date of the Event":"02/06/2010 06:55 UTC","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Annapolis","There were no other sightings in Annapolis on or around February 6th 2010"],"City":"Annapolis","Case Number":"21796"}
