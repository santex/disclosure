My mom was the first to come out to see what I was looking at it was huge there was 3 lights in a Chevron or flying V shape UFO it was very low in altitude moved very slow and made a sound kind of a high pitch humming sound. By the time my dad came out of the house he had a Sony Mavica camera in hand so he tryed taking pictures but the camera did not turn on and would not work on a fully charged battery? so we just watch it fly over the tree tops as it slowly got out of our sight. When we all went back inside we were all in shock as to what we just saw in the night skys of upsate New York the crazy thing is the Sony Movica Camera worked fine after we went back inside."],"Latitude":"43.022398","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Object Shape":"Chevron, Triangle"}
