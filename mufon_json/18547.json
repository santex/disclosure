(i play golf on monday and thursday so it had to be either tues or weds) the moon was to the se so i was looking towards the ocean. i noticed a light moving towards me. it was orange. it was not like a plane light, it wasn't a point source. it was bloomed circular like a light in fog except there was no fog. it came directly toward the inlet. when it got over the general dynamics electric boatyard it changed direction and headed ne and moved away until it dwindled and disappeared (i know it changed direction because it appeared to stop when it started to move directly away from me but i am pretty sure it never changed speed). it appeared to be going faster than a prop plane, like a slow jet. it never changed altitude or speed. when it got pretty far away i could guess its altitude to be somewhere between 10 and 20k feet. it wasn't nearly as high as commercial airliners would be but higher than most small planes. it was totally silent, i no engine sound at all. within a couple of minutes of it disappearing in the distance (it was clear enough that i watched it dwindle in size to nothing) another appeared where the first appeared and followed the exact same path, same altitude, same speed and same orange light. it disappeared exactly like the first, they were identical in every respect. at no time did either show any other light source other than the orange glow and i could not see any kind of craft outline. the light also looked exactly the same coming and going. as i was watching the first one someone was walking by and made a comment about how strange it looked. there were probably around 20 people sitting on the wall within a quarter mile of me who must also have seen them. after seeing the second one i stuck around for about 20 minutes to see if any more would show up. none did but a small prop plane flew by at a couple thousand feet. i could hear the engine clearly and saw red, green and white lights, one flashing. i could also see the outline of the plane. the lights were point sources too, nothing like the orange lights. i am an engineer. i have a few hours flight time and i was in the air force. this was like no plane i ever saw. i am not a true believer and i have never seen anything before that i would classify as a ufo but this was strange enough that i am reporting it."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.359294,+-72.091861(18547)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18547) map </A>","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in New London","There were no other sightings in New London on or around August 4th 2009"]}
