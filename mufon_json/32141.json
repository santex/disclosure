{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAbout 8 tonight I took my dog out in the back yard to do her business. Every night I sky watch and have for years. So I looked up as soon as I stepped out the back door and there were two large amber lights going over the house. The lights were the same size and they stayed the same distance apart.. the lights went behind some trees, so I ran to the end of my yard and waited until they came in to view again. I got the feeling that these lights were at the back of a craft. The lights were low not very much over tree top level. There was no sound, if I had not looked up, would never have seen them. It was way too low for a plane. Their were no landing lights, no red light. Could not have been lanterns because they were flying vertical. No helicopter because they were to close not to have heard the noise helicopters make I have no idea ...what this was but never seen anything like it before. After lights were out of sight saw planes going same direction."],"Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"amber lights flew over house","Date Submitted":"09/27/2011 11:08 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Arkansas","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/27/2011 08:05 UTC","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Little Rock","There was one other sighting in Little Rock on or around September 27th 2011"],"City":"Little Rock","Object Shape":"Other","Longitude":"-92.36518","Case Number":"32141","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-09272011-0017","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/32141.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/32141.html"],"Latitude":"34.676869","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.676869,+-92.36518(32141)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32141) map </A>"}
