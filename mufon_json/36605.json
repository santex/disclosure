(i did see the same object 12\\25\\11 around 0630am and that time the sighting lasted for 30 mintues) at first i thought it may have been one of the police helicopters circling the area but i took a closer look and it had a glow of blue and violet colors and it would stop and hover then turn very fast and also it would do these zig zag maneuver and it would also fade in and out. at first i thought theese two sightings was cool when i kept looking at the object i did catch my self looking to the left and right of me. this object is kinda making me nervous a little but not to much. i did lost sight of it cause it faded out."],"trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were 3 other sightings in Phoenix on or around March 20th 2012"],"Summary":"seen the same object 3 and half months ago","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36605.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-03202012-0007","Object Shape":"Circle","Region":"Arizona","City":"Phoenix","Date Submitted":"03/20/2012 08:53 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.452377,+-112.066387(36605)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36605) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/20/2012 04:40 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
