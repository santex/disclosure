I was driving and so, of course i could not stare at the object overhead. As I took further glances (as long as safely possible) i saw a low flying triangular shaped object with what looked like 3 white lights on either side and a single red light in the very center of, none of which were blinking. When I turned to look at it for a second time it was just completing a 180 degree turn (which was not at all wide). The craft was extremely low and moved extremely slow. I would like to know if anyone has seen this object or know of aircraft with a slow, low-flying, tight-turning, triangular shape."],"Latitude":"42.482562","Date Submitted":"11/15/2007 07:15 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-71.147436","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.482562,+-71.147436(8368)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8368) map </A>"}
