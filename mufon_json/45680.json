{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Oklahoma","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside in my groom-to-be's truck listening to music and i got out, about to go inside and I looked up because I heard a very faint whirring sound coming from above.. Figured I might have been imagining it like it was maybe a helecoptor or something, but I wasn't imagining it and it was NOT a helecoptor. I watched this for a duration of a minute when the first one dissapeared. the first one was round like a disk and went in a path of SE went straight then turned and went straight SW. the second one came literally about 50 seconds later, almost a minute and lasted for approximately 1minute and 30 seconds it was a boomerang shape with a light on the front and one on each end. Looked like a triangle of lights and was moving very fast. This one made a whirring sound but no way of telling where it was coming from. once it made its pathway just about a minute and a few seconds later, it was gone. Please tell me this isn't crazy. I wish I would've caught evidence.. I will definantly be prepared next time.."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"Ponca City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45680.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45680.html"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02122013-0005","Case Number":"45680","Date of the Event":"02/03/2013 02:23 UTC","Date Submitted":"02/12/2013 04:28 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.731302,+-97.079618(45680)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45680) map </A>","Latitude":"36.731302","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Ponca City","There were no other sightings in Ponca City on or around February 3rd 2013"],"Object Shape":"Boomerang, Disc, Oval, Triangle","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"very bright. very slow moving. happened twice.","Longitude":"-97.079618","Source":"MUFON"}
