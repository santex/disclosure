(descent, pitch up - breaking action\\effect, pitch down, pitch up #2, pitch down #2 - this prevents atmospheric burn up and it is also is part of steering into the landing zone) the final pitch up, #3, took it out of site, to the nw and aid area. the ablation effect varied as the vehicle made its velocity adjustments. it then turned toward the nw (to dulles -- aid --). where it went after that i do not know. i did not time it but i think it may have been thirty seconds. in school the next day my friend and neighbor, {pid1} (lived one block away on oakwood dr. -- 1st barn style house on right after the cul-de-sac, foxwood nook?) saw it too. he asked if i had heard about the ufo crash in kecksburg, pa. i said \"no.\" he thought we did see it. i can't positively remember if other classmates saw it too. after all of these years i'm still not sure if that was the kecksburg vehicle or not. from what i have read on the kecksburg vehicle, it was picked up over canadian airspace then came through the u.s.'s airspace to crash in washington center's region (artcc) at kecksburg, pa. . i don't know if the faa keeps \"interesting\" radar tapes archived or not. it should have shown up on at least tapes for the dc artcc (wash. center - leesburg) and maybe aid, was and bwi. military radars would be andrews and bowling. at that time i was teaching myself about flying airplanes, spacecraft and rockets since i wanted to become an astronau\\pilot. nasa had visited our school at that time. if you need to get a second story on that from rich, i do not know how to reach him. after that school year his father, (air force) was reassigned to california. i want to say vandenberg, afb but i'm not sure. our school was belvedere elementary on columbia pike. fairfax county may have a record of where he transfered to if you need to check with rich. his older brother charlie may or may not have joined the air force. i don't know if he or his sister (becky?) saw it too. fox in raleigh, nc ran a regular tv show about ufo's in the fall of 1996. one night they ran kecksburg. after that story ran i called their call-in phone number and told them the federal governments given explanation was a lie, which it was. i want to say james oberg was the \"government's expert\" appearing on the show that night. names of russian projects and passed u.s. missions were also used to say it was that spacecraft. that also became the last episode since fox took the series off of the air without any announcement. (that network action is not that uncommon of a practice). {cms\\jat\\pid} text moved to narrative"],"Log Number":"US-02262009-0018","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Region":"Virginia","Summary":"No meteor.
