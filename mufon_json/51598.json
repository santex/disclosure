It looked as if it was breaking apart as it was starting to leave a trail of light behind it. The object then slowed down to a hover and seemed to disappear. About 4-5 seconds later the object reappeared looking like a cluster of lights. It disappeared and reappeared randomly every few seconds five or six time. Each time the object seemed to be moving and changing direction until it did not reappear."],"Summary":"Very slow moving meteor-like object that appeared to be breaking apart however slowed to a hover.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51598.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51598.html"],"Region":"Arizona","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in San Tan Valley","There were no other sightings in San Tan Valley on or around October 16th 2013"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.176538,+-111.562692(51598)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51598) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/17/2013 01:37 UTC","Case Number":"51598","Date of the Event":"10/16/2013 07:40 UTC","Log Number":"US-10172013-0002","Longitude":"-111.562692"}
