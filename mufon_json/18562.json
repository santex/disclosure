We traveled this country road at night several times a week to visit an older gentleman that I was a guardian for. The objects appeared to be several lights that joined together and separated at various times, when they joined as one unit, it appeared to shed something kind of like a burning molten liquid. We were near the village of Yukon and saw these objects to the south of I-70. We haven't told many people about this, I'm sure you know why! But just having seen tonight's show, I think that they may have been very close to the Kecksburg area. Also near the area where we were, there was some sort of hazardous material disposal site, not sure if that has any bearing on this."],"City":"Yukon","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18562.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18562.html"],"Longitude":"-79.682995","Disposition":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08092009-0012","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
