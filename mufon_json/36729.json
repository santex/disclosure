I was looking out of the window and suddenly had the impulse to look up into the sky and the clouds. The day was lovely, but I'm not someone who scans the sky, and I just felt like I was searching for something--almost like I was \"supposed to\"(which sounds weird, I know.) Then I noticed, high up against the sky, at the edge of a cloud, an object flying parallel to the road, just under the clouds. It was silent, it had no trail and no wings that I could see, and it was a brighter white than any planes I have seen in the sky. It didn't appear reflective, but it was so high up that it was hard to tell. I couldn't see any details, but it was solid and more \"outlined\" that things usually seem to me that high up. It was only visible for a minute or so until it entered a cloud and was no longer visible."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.110473,+-72.581111(36729)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36729) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36729.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36729.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Massachusetts","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
