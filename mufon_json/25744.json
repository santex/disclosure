I said to him, look those aircrafts are flying very close to one another by the time I could show him they were gone. At first I thought it might be the sun catching an airplane but couldn't figure out why they were flying so close together. I ran in and told my family.... Later on about 2 hours later I took the dog for a walk, as I turned onto Marybeth I saw two stars very close together in the night sky. I said to myself, \"no **** sherlock, you saw stars earlier!\" As I laughed both Stars disappeared pretty darn fast. What the heck was that???? I also realized that it would have been impossible for those two stars to be in that position because earlier they were SW and now they were SE! Again I told the family but they weren't there so who knows really what I did see? Came on this sight to see if anyone else saw what I did?"],"City":"Baltimore","Date of the Event":"10/07/2010 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-76.608899","Date Submitted":"10/08/2010 03:43 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.300185,+-76.608899(25744)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25744) map </A>","Country":"United States","Case Number":"25744","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
