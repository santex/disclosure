As we leave the city on the free way , it was already dark and we look back at the sky and we see that something is following us , we didnt know what it was, so we ignored it and kept going. I look back at it and i see that it keeps following us and we start wondering what the hell it is. We Arrive to our home town and i see that it followed us all the way home, out of all the cars and trucks and people on the freeway it followed us , and we had no clue why. Me and family get home and we start to think its a UFO , so we tell my dad to leave in the truck to see if it followed him and it didnt, the family next door saw it too and just ran back inside as they never seen it. My dad leaves it doesnt follow, i leave it doesnt follow, my brothers girlfriend leaves it doesnt follow her either, it stay floating at my house. I come back, i go into my house and its still here , hovering over the backyard, i go outside and i get closer to where it is , i look at it and its not glowing but its lighting itself enough to where i can see it, it was a bunch of circles lit up go around in cirlces. It makes a noise i cant explain the noise ive never heard anything like it, it was silent yet when i heard it i froze where i was , i couldnt move, a second later i ran back inside my house , i didnt go back outside after that. i dont remember when or how it disappeared that night but after that night i believed more in other life forms existing in this universe we live in. No one believes me but i saw what i saw , and i was not on drugs of any kind i was completely sober, i was too young for that stuff anyways. It was a night i will never forget, i wasnt the only one that saw it either , my whole family saw it and other friends of the family. I never seen anything like that in my life, it wasnt a plane or anything commercial, it was something outta this world , it had to been. No one believes us , but i dont care i know what i saw ..... thats it thank you for your time"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"37.963202","Log Number":"US-01152008-0003","trends":["There have been 25 other sightings in Stockton","There was one other sighting in Stockton on or around July 10th 1998"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval","City":"Stockton","Date Submitted":"07/10/1998 08:30 UTC"}
