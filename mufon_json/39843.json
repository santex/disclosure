The object had no apparant features, but clearly was not a conventional aircraft as we were in flight path of 3 different major airports and at one point a passenger jet passed through our line of sight of the object giving us a clear comparison. The object appeared to be very high, very slow moving and eventually we just lost sight of it. Was one of 3 seperate unknown sighting within a 48 hour period within a 100mile radius."],"Date Submitted":"06/26/2012 08:50 UTC","Case Number":"39843","Object Shape":"Sphere","Date of the Event":"06/24/2012 04:45 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.67297,+-122.076396(39843)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (39843) map </A>","City":"Hayward","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
