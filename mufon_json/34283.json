It moved rapidly and can be described as a fish swimming in water. It looked like a fiber optic light moving from one color to the next seamlessly. I told him to go get a camera and by the time he came back it looked as if it landed somewhere near the west mesa. I viewed it personally for about a minute. My husband viewed it for about 2 minutes. We will never forget what we saw this Christmas Eve night."],"Region":"New Mexico","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34283.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34283.html"]}
