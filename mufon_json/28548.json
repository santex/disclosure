Because there was some renovation going on downstairs we were all camped out upstairs in a living room type space with a large window that faced north. I wasn���t able to fall asleep as quickly as the others so I was looking out the window admiring the night sky. We had just moved from the city (to the suburbs) and seeing lots of stars in the sky was new to me. I started watching what at first appeared to be a large star (no color difference that I can remember) It started moving across the sky and I though it was a satellite and though how cool that was. But as I continued to watch it, it started moving like nothing else I have ever seen. Left, right, up and down moving closer and father away. Shooting quickly to a new location then suddenly changing direction at a 90 degree angle and moving slowly. After watching it for a long time I got scared and hid my head under the blanket. I was not able to fall asleep that night until the sun started to come up and the birds were singing. I just want to note that though I was young at the time I was not dreaming or hallucinating. This was not the work of a young imagination. Before that night I had not even though about the possibility of life outside this planet. Also this was not a firefly as it did not flicker. Years later when I told a friend that lives in the neighborhood of my experience she recounted a similar sighting at around the same time."]}
