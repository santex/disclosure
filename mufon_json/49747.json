Speed amd movement strikingly different from planes. Too many directional changes and far too large and multi-colored for meteor. Possibly military craft, but I was in Air Force & this was much faster and more agile than anything I've ever seen. If real, it should have been seen by others looking for meteors."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/11/2013 10:11 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.139915","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08112013-0046","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Greenville","There were no other sightings in Greenville on or around August 11th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49747.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49747.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.194253,+-87.139915(49747)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49747) map </A>","Region":"Kentucky"}
