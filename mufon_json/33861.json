Amazingly the object flattened out from it's downward trajectory, and started to wobble and hover at an incredible speed. Then, before I could get a camera shot at it, the orb increased it's speed by a lot and shot off at a 30 Degree angle out of site. Most surreal moment of my life, felt like 2 minutes went by. I was mesmerized by it and ran inside to alert my family. At this very moment I have a camera looking up to that portion of the sky! Scared? Yes."],"Longitude":"-120.688538","Date Submitted":"12/07/2011 12:43 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Latitude":"35.163749","City":"Pismo Beach","Log Number":"US-12072011-0002","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.163749,+-120.688538(33861)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33861) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Pismo Beach","There were no other sightings in Pismo Beach on or around December 6th 2011"],"Summary":"I looked up and saw a dis-like orb of light hovering across the sky, then shot off at twice the velocity! !","Object Shape":"Disc, Star-like","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33861.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33861.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Case Number":"33861","Tags":"City"}
