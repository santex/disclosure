We are use to it. Lately the events are happening about once a week. The last event of Oct 13, 2013. I saw a grey Alien outside of my bedroom window. He was staring at me and for some reason I got the impression that he wanted me to see him to make sure I saw him and knew what he was. He then turned and took a lobbing step. (a step that was kind of like a hop (up and down). I also get the impression that I have seen this Alien before. Like I said my wife and myself have had numerous experiences. I was hoping someone could call me to discuss this."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51590.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51590.html"],"Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Region":"Connecticut","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Killingworth","There were no other sightings in Killingworth on or around October 13th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"10/16/2013 12:09 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
