I looked up, and noticed this long trail in the sky. I've never seen a trail like that, so I started taking pictures of it with my iphone. I work with a former Marine, and when I pointed to it in the sky he could not identify it. We went into a nearby restaurant, and I continued to watch the object, from the window, for about 25 minutes. I noticed the object make several turns, but it always appeared to be going in the same direction (down). By the time we finished dinner, it was dark and I could not see the object. At first, I thought the object was probably a jet. But, I later zoomed into the pictures, and noticed that the object appeared disc-like."],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-11272010-0007","Region":"Texas","Case Number":"26755","trends":["There have been 173 other sightings in Houston","There were no other sightings in Houston on or around November 18th 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","City":"Houston","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26755.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26755_submitter_file1__154975_1610534617062_1047133028_31686021_5679199_n.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26755_submitter_file2__ufo1.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/26755_submitter_file3__ufo2.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26755.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=29.767653,+-95.3661(26755)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26755) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"29.767653","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/18/2010 05:20 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"Strange turning disc object"}
