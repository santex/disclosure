Im not sure of thedate. I can only remember that is was in the Spring of 1985.I dont remember how it cought my attention but I saw a large star above thetrees. Although it was only a star-like light, I could tell that it was near theearth. After about 10 seconds, it moved quickly for a few inches in the sky thenmade an acute turnB130 degrees without stopping. It went made about 3 of these sharp turns andthen shot like a rocket out of the sky.I never felt any real emotions other than surprise. I never called or told manypeople about it. I assumed that the local Dobbins Air Force Base would not havetold me anything and that most people would think I was crazy.Quite frankly, I dont really believe in E.T.s. My only real hope in sending thisis that you will let me know that others saw the same thing.Thanks."],"Longitude":"-84.541933","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/30/1984 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.961762","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.961762,+-84.541933(2121)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2121) map </A>","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/2121.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/2121.html"],"Log Number":"","Date of the Event":"11/30/1984 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"2121","Sighting Duration":"00:00:59","Region":"Georgia","Summary":"Starlight makes quick moves and acutes angled turn","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Marietta","Country":"United States"}
