A plane passed over it andstill it remained hovering. I asked my daughters if they could see the object,they both said yes. They also described it as I saw it. The object stayed inthe sky above me for 3-4 minutes and then in an instant second it was gone. Ithought it may be a star but a star is round and not rectangular.
