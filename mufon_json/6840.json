we could not see the source of these lights at all, but, it blocked out the lights that usually sillouette the tree line east of our house. that would be about 1\\2 to 1\\4 of a mile span. we could not see any stars in that area, and usually we can see a few dim ones. the source of these lights would have had to be black, big and flat, if the lights were coming from a craft of some sort. then my husband saw a red light in the timber behind our neighbor's house which is east of us (closer to the ground) i saw a white light at the time he saw the red one closer to the ground in the timber. then the last thing i saw, which no one else saw, was an orange fireball shoot right over the roof of our neighbor's house (east of us)from ssw to ene. we had put the video camera on the charger by that time and my father and mother-in-law had come to watch the light show. they got there too late to see anything except what we had taped. this sighting lasted about an hour. then it just stopped, no noise, no lights nothing. i did hear though the next day, that someone who lives east and south of us several miles also saw weird lights in the sky about the same time that we saw these. neither one of us has ever seen anything quite like this before. i have seen the big black triangle thing with the round lights on each of the three corners while driving a truck at night, and i have seen a very long silver \"rod\" shaped cylinder over my father and mother-in-law's house during the day several years ago, among other things. but not that anyone else ever saw at the same time that i did, so i never reported them. this time, there was another witness, and we got it on video. i don't know how to attach video clips or sketches to this report, but i did call the st. clair county sheriff's dept. and reported the sighting of april 16th and what i thought was the previous sighting of the \"thursday\" night ones that i saw alone. i keep a dated and timed hour by hour diary of my horses progress through the last stages of her pregnancy,i had writen what i saw in that diary. after giving copies of my notes of those lights sighted on april 9th (still thinking it was the previous thursday) i realized that the date that i jotted it down in the horse diary was april 9th. one week to the day before the april 16th sighting. the deputy mr. couch, didn't take the tape because he said that there wasn't enough on the tape to show anything. i told him that this wasn't a joke, after he said he didn't know what he was going to do with a report like this, and declining to take the video tape. i'll never report things like this to the sheriff's office again in st. clair county. i told him that i wasn't a kook, that i was an rn. and that i knew the sheriff, and the officer in the next small town north of us, and that they knew me personally, but that didn't seem to matter to him! i wish i hadn't called it in now!"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.210927,+-93.286099(6840)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6840) map </A>","Latitude":"37.210927","Longitude":"-93.286099","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unknown","Country":"United States","City":"Springfield","Case Number":"6840","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"start with red lite then orange lites lighting up left to right then going out hovering in our back yard practically","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Shape":"Fireball, Flash, Sphere, Other, Unknown","Log Number":"US-04182007-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6840.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6840.html"]}
