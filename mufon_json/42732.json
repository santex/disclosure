Cars stopped to look also. At first i thought maybe it was an asteroid, but then two other things looked like they had been ejected from the primary object, trailing behind the biggest one. We both stood there and watched then i ran down the road to see if i could see the object, unfortunately i was blocked by buildings. We both felt quite strange after this event."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"09/22/2012 10:07 UTC","Date of the Event":"09/21/2012 11:17 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"52.609614","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=52.609614,+1.288803(42732)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42732) map </A>","Object Shape":"Fireball, Triangle","Tags":"City","Country":"United Kingdom","Longitude":"1.288803","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
