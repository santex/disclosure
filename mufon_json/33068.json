I like to look at the stars and constellations ocassionally, especially when the the seasons change. This morning, I was looking up and saw two, dull white objects following each other. They were up very high, maybe even in outer space. They were identical, just a dull white glow. No blinking lights, just appeared round. The first round object caught my eye. It was round, like a dot. But at one time, it seemed to be unsteady for a second or so. The object behind it looked just like the first one, but was on a \"mechanical driven\" course behind it. What I mean was, it seemed driven to follow the other one. After these past thru the tree line I could not see them any longer. But these objects were in space, or the highest of earths space. I have never seen anything so strange before."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"33068","Object Shape":"Oval","Summary":"Two white orbs following each other in sky.","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"11/02/2011 08:56 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33068.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33068.html"]}
