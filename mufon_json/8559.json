{"Latitude":"34.752681","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Date Submitted":"05/03/2007 02:30 UTC","divs":["sighting detailsstanding outside one night with my wife we were at my mothers house on the outskirts of little rock smoking a cigarette. i happened to look up as i am always aware of my surroundings, my wife and i noticed a strange object flying fairly low almost right above the tree tops it was. this object was almost gliding across the sky and as i recall it had a total of 4 visible lights on the bottom of it....3 of the lights were identical and on one was on each of the corners of the triangle they appeared to be similar to landing lights but with a strange glow to them, and were definately not flares as i was an infantryman for the us army and have extensive knowledge of flares. in the middle of this object was a sort of blueish circle\\bubble and to the naked eye it seemed somewhat distorted almost a blur. the object proceeded in a straight line over the tree line, across the front yard and then over our heads and then over the house with only a faint roaring noise which could have been from commercial jets or some kind of fighter jet from lrafb, i have noticed more and more reports within the last few years from arkansas and firmly believe that it was man made and not of alien origin....my theory is and will be until proven otherwise that perhaps the 1947 case was a downed\\crashed ufo from another world and was then reverse engineered by our government in secret, and i believe now that the government has at least 3 to 4 different models of these strange craft and have had since the early to mid 1950s, i was in the military as an infantryman and have worked under \"sierra\" (secret) conditions with the m1126 (stryker) in developmental stages and the land\\mounted warrior program which the army claims to have killed yet my buddies in iraq are the only unit in the army that possess this technology and are actively using it? government cover ups are a real thing and always will be. i unfortunately have no photos of this object as it was a rather quick event and my wife and i just sort of couldn't take our eyes off of this magnificent object. i have chosen to remain anonymous because i do not wish to be persecuted by the army for disclosing certain info contained herein. however this website admin is free to contact me."],"Date of the Event":"05/03/2007 02:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Arkansas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Little Rock","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.752681,+-92.282645(8559)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8559) map </A>","Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"US-12062007-0004","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8559.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8559.html"],"Case Number":"8559","Disposition":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-92.282645","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Little Rock","There were no other sightings in Little Rock on or around May 3rd 2007"],"Summary":"triangular object with 3 smaller lights on bottom corners and one larger in middle.","Source":"MUFON"}
