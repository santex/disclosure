Being an avid sky watcher, when I am smoking I am usually also looking up at the night sky, looking at the stars, watching the passing planes that land at Spokane International Airport, etc... I usually see \"shooting stars\" and satelites in orbit passing overhead and think nothing of them. What I say tonight (July 15, 2006) was a little out of the ordinary from what I normally see each night. I was outside my house looking out towards the west, when almost directly above me I saw something that at first I thought was a satelite...but then I noticed that it was a little to close to the ground and moving a little to fast to be a satelite. It looked like a row of lights, six or eight lights total, red in color and not too bright, heading due south. It appeared that all of the lights were connected to one object--- the spaces in between the lights where blacking out the sky above the object as it passed overhead. It was going in straight line, keeping the same speed the entire time it was in my sight, no turns or sudden stops. I know it was not a landing plane as the flight path was wrong and the speed was to fast. It took approx. 3 seconds for this object to come from behind me to completely out of site over the city to the south. I have seen strange things in the sky before that I shrugged off as being something natural or man made, but this just felt different inside of me for some reason. Not sure if this something your organization would like to know about, and normally I wouldn't even bother reporting it, but what I saw just seemed a little out of place to me and my first thought after it dissapeared was to contact MUFON and tell my story. Nothing exciting or ground breaking I know, but still seems like the right thing to do."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
