It looked like a cars headlights in the air. We were about two miles away from it when we noticed it, it was pretty bright and it was not blinking but as we were going under the overpass it seemed the lights turned off and we lost sight. I thought it was a heli at first but saw no flashers or spotlights. My Gf just kept saying \"thats an f'n UFO!\" and of all nights not to have the flip camera with us!!!"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"26879","Date of the Event":"11/28/2010 07:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26879.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26879.html"],"Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"12/07/2010 01:23 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"30.271383","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.271383,+-97.741151(26879)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (26879) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Texas","Summary":"UFO over I 35 in Austin Tx","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Log Number":"US-12072010-0001","trends":["There have been 188 other sightings in Austin","There was one other sighting in Austin on or around November 28th 2010"],"City":"Austin","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Longitude":"-97.741151"}
