(i'm an ex-sky diver and can judge pretty good) as i drove closer it began to move southwest\\west into the heavy cloud hanging there. it dissapeard into the cloud as i turned off hiway 60 and homestead road. it had started moving down homestead road as it dissapeard. i parked the car and got out but it was no longer visable. it was a beautiful day that morning and it was clear except for that one darn cloud. as the cloud moved on i waited to catch a glimpse but saw nothing further. i still felt confused as to what i had just witnessed. i hesitated telling anyone, but eventually told my sister. i have not mentioned it to anyone until now. i saw something on tv about mufon and decided to contact you. i was so intriged by it's size that i set my odometer on the car to zero and drove back to where i originally saw it. it was exactly 3 miles to the stoplight to homestead road. this thing had to be gigantic! i would love to know if anyone else saw this as well. it never made the papers."],"Region":"Nevada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","City":"Pahrump","Latitude":"36.211264","Case Number":"22069","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Pahrump","There were no other sightings in Pahrump on or around February 29th 2004"],"Tags":"City","Object Features":"Window(s), Patterned Surface, Louvres","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Disposition":"IFO"}
