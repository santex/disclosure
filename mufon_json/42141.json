I usually look up into the skies, this is NOT my first time seeing a ufo, but is is my first tie seeing ths kind., Anyways, I saw it at the top right corner of my eye, i quickly fell off of my bike in amazement! It was like it was falling out of the sky! It looked like something was long was coming down so fast it caught fire due to the speed! I was unable to obtain any recordings or pictures, it was too late by the time i got my phone out. but yeah it was so scary, I waited to see if there was a sound of the landing, of some kind of crash, but there was none. it was a couple of miles northwest from my location, I felt more surprised than anything, but yeah, that's my story,"]}
