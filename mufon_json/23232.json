{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI observed a bright white object traveling very slowly across the sky. It was nearly straight up above near me. There is a photo of a sighting that remains me exactly of what I saw from a report in New Jersey on today's date. The light moved very slowly from west to east, and a plane actually flew underneath it. I have seen the ISS and several satellites before, but this object not only flew very slowly it also changed direction slightly from east to west to East to Southeast. At first glance it looked like a star but you could clearly tell it was moving. I lost sight of the object I believe due to a building, but it either disappeared or sped off as I attempted to take a picture with my phone (It was too high up to get a picture).
