Thought it was going to crash but the trees at 392 blocked my view. After I lost sight of the object I looked at my watch and it was 8:10 p.m. Once I got on 392 it was gone. I thought it crashed, went back the next day but could not see a thing. I thought when I first saw the object it was a meteorite because it was large, round and bright green. I ran the stop sign at 392 because I was watching it till it ran out of sight behind the trees on 392. I was scared becausse I was not sure what the object was and at how fast it was coming. Reported the incident to Mike Peters at the Greeley Tribune. He went to invest the incident. He went to the Greeley airport and the national guard. Mike Peters said someone had seen the same thing I did about an hour later but this time the object was moving slow."],"Country":"United States","City":"Greeley","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.432854,+-104.703062(12974)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12974) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12974.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12974.html"],"Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","Longitude":"-104.703062","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"10/06/2008 08:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown"}
