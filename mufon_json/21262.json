We watched it for hours, it would make circles in the sky going in and out of clouds and then disappear for a few minutes. Then it would reappear in the same spot is disappeared from. I am not sure why we didn't wake my parents up but none of us were scared of it. The object almost seemed like it was watching us. After a while it just disappeared and never reappeared. We really didn't know what to think about it. Then I went to the library a few days later and started looking at books about UFO sightings and found a picture of an egg shaped UFO that looked a lot like the one we saw and I knew then what it was."],"Longitude":"-92.138684","Object Flight Path":"Other","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21262.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21262.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.250503,+-92.138684(21262)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21262) map </A>","Case Number":"21262"}
