It was a very clear night, and so I stared at it, knowing this could not be a plane or helicopter, but maybe a comet or maybe a satellite. I called my friend on the phone to talk to him about it but just as I was calling it started to speed up so I stared again and it seemed to accelerate at speeds nothing on earth could recreate, it was almost exponential, and then the light just went away (dissolved) over a period of .5-1 sec. Not instantly, just faded away. At first, I was amazed, but now I really want some kind of explanation."],"Case Number":"22265","Region":"Texas","Log Number":"US-03122010-0002","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-99.899583","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/12/2010 11:50 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","City":"Undisclosed"}
