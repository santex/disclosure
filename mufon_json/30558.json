{"Country":"Canada","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is my fourth sighting. They are becoming commonplace already. I am expecting them to drop in for tea. I had just gotten to work and parked the car. As I was getting my lunch from the car trunk I looked up ans saw the space station flying over Edmonton from SW to NE. I thought I would take a few moments and watch it go over. Just as it was over top of me I saw another dark object streaking from West to East,travelling pretty well in a straight line with a slight downward arc. Just as it passed under the space station it gave off a brilliant flash of white light, then went dark anddissapeared in the eastern sky. As I have seen these before I was not startled or alarmed. I just thought, \"Oh! There is another one.\""],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"30558","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"53.511066","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Flash","City":"Edmonton","Log Number":"CA-08082011-0057","Summary":"My fourth sighting.","Region":"Alberta","Longitude":"-113.417235","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"08/08/2011 12:46 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"08/02/2011 05:03 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 70 other sightings in Edmonton","There were no other sightings in Edmonton on or around August 2nd 2011"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.511066,+-113.417235(30558)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30558) map </A>","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30558.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30558.html"]}
