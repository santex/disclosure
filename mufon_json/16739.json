{"Date Submitted":"04/29/2009 09:20 UTC","Region":"Nebraska","divs":["sighting detailsthis is not the first time i have seen ufos, however, this time i felt the need to report it because it has been very disturbing. when i was a kid, i read lots of books about alien abductions, but as i became an adult, i decided that ufo stuff was false. this year things have changed, i have seen about 3 ufos, and now i don't know what to think. at about 9:20pm, i was headed out of my apartment to my parents' house. i have a good relationship with them, and we live in the same hometown, so i was going to pay them a visit. as i walked out, i noticed a star in the sky that was moving. there was no sound, and no lights blinking, so i knew it wasn't an airplane. i started wondering what it could be, but then the light started curling around in an \"s\" shape. then i knew that it wasn't a plane or satellite, and i was pretty scared, because i've seen 2 other ufos that scared me and i didn't want to see another one, so i decided to get in my car and immediately drive to my parent's house, and pretend and try to convince myself i saw a plane. when i got to my parents house a couple minutes later, i was shaken, and then i decided to look at the skies again, to see if it was still there. i saw nothing and decided to walk inside. as i walked towards the house again, i had the urge to jerk my head back and look again, and when i did, i saw a black triangle ufo just zip out of nowhere at an unrealistic and frightening speed, and then it suddenly stopped on a dime right above my parent's house and me in a very threatening and scary manner. the ufo zipped and then stopped in the middle of the air just long enough for me to see it definitely wasn't a plane, and that it was a triangle. the triangle ufo wasn't very big, just about as big as a plane flying low, but i didn't look at it very long. it stopped in a very frightening manner, almost like it knew i was looking at\\for it, and was trying to intimidate me. since this is the 3rd ufo i have seen, i have been thinking about carrying a camera with me, however every ufo is very frightening to me, and i usually try to put it out of my head however i can. also because i read books about alien abductions as a kid, i don't want to get abducted either. the reason why i am finally coming forward, is that 3 times is too much, and it's really starting to disturb me, and i am afraid to walk outside at night."],"Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"16739","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04302009-0001","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16739.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16739.html"],"Latitude":"41.127217","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in North Platte","There were no other sightings in North Platte on or around April 29th 2009"],"City":"North Platte","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Star-like, Triangle","Date of the Event":"04/29/2009 09:20 UTC","Summary":"Flying star UFO, then a triangle.","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-100.756623","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.127217,+-100.756623(16739)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16739) map </A>"}
