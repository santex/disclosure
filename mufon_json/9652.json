Basically, I can take a spreadsheet (or make one) with date,type of sighting, number of reports etc and creae a geographic data base that spits out maps..these maps can then be generate in ANY particular group of info, example, If you send me Every sighting report for 2006, I can plot lat, long, genrate maps for evry month, generate a different map for sightings in summer vs winter, within 1 week of full moon, etc or any parameter we decide. You make what is called a shape file and it can be used for ever....If you send me a years worth of reports, any year, i will crunch numbers and send you so examples...if the reports are more than a thousand a year, mabey start with a month...but im down for whatever.
