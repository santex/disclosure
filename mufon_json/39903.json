Driving down our street after coming home from having an ice cream. 2. Bright blue light and like a leaf or feather floating to the ground. 3. Something coming down from space. 4. Bright dark blue light changing to a lighter color as it went from left to right and up and down. Stopping at times and then shooting off with the light being bright blue to a bright white as it moved around fading at times.. Disappeared quickly and returned with a white blue light changing to a brighter blue. 5. Relaxed thought maybe someone was flying something. After watching it for awhile no one could have been flying this with a remote. Didn't get it much thought to being a UFO, until I started reading on UFO's. 6. Went dark and never saw it again."]}
