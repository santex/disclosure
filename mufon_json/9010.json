{"City":"Stephenville","divs":["Sighting DetailsI drive a water transport in the oilfield out of Bono,TX. I drive to and from Stephenville Saturday thru Wednesday. I left work at 5:45pm Tuesday evening January 8, 2008, traveling west on Hwy.67, between Chalk Mountain and Three Way. This is when something caught my eye off in the western sky. I saw two very bright lights shining in no apparent direction. The lights were very bright, like a welding arc. The lights were dancing around and then they split in two diffrent directions at a very fast rate of speed. I do not know what it was that I saw, but I don't think that it was a plane, weather balloon, a reflection of the sun or anything manmade. Thank you, Harlan Cowan"],"Log Number":"US-01182008-0018","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in Stephenville","There were 7 other sightings in Stephenville on or around January 8th 2008"],"Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date Submitted":"01/08/2008 06:10 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Summary":"Two really bright lights fairly close together dancing round then they split in opposite directions","Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.226766","Case Number":"9010","Date of the Event":"01/08/2008 06:10 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Texas","Disposition":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9010.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9010.html"],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.226766,+-98.197353(9010)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9010) map </A>","Longitude":"-98.197353"}
