Roscommon, Ireland on July 12th 2008 at around 11:00. Later, inspecting photos on PC (Exilim Casio S600) I noticed funny shape over my head - zoom showed sort of saturn-like object Below and to the left was smaller ball like form - that might be camera blemish. On other photo at that house, a small sphere seemed to float over house. The sphere was more focussed, while Saturn object somewhat un-focussed -unclear if from distance or movement. It is jsut possible it may be a bird - though bird profiles I#ve found on-line don't really match - I was hoping a photo expert could distinguish the possibilities."],"Case Number":"11997","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.776803,+-8.10399(11997)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11997) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/12/2008 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"53.776803","City":"Strokestown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11997.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11997_submitter_file1__CIMG1592.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/11997_submitter_file2__CIMG1596.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11997.html"],"Summary":"Ufo appeared in photo only seen as photo on PC","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
