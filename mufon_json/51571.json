I have video taped it and can provide that video. In addition I have observed this object with binoculars. I speculate it is military in origin. I contacted the FAA in Louisville KY, and they did respond and state that there was activity taking place approximately 10 miles from my house, but did not state what type of activity. This object is present almost every night at the same time, but the location has changed as the year has progressed. I did notice a reduction of objects when I reported to FAA, but they have since returned. Thought you guys might want to take a look at the video and see if you could tell me exactly what this device is I am observing. I would like to remain anonymous."],"Case Number":"51571","Date Submitted":"10/15/2013 12:32 UTC","Longitude":"-84.504396","Log Number":"US-10152013-0009","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.344396,+-84.504396(51571)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51571) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","Object Features":"Other","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Sadieville","There were no other sightings in Sadieville on or around October 14th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
