{"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsLearn about the true nature of N.A.S.A. Nasa had discovered that the Earths Moon was inhabited when they viewed the first images sent back from Ranger 7 in 1964. Ranger 7 sent back over 4000 images showing life on the Moon. Nasa is a branch of the United States Military Air Force. Going to the moon in 1969 was not to land on the Moon. It was for Military observation, documentation and study of the highly advanced intelligents that resides on the Moon. The Apollo Program designed to pacify public interest in the Moon and the solar system. This presentation breaks the debunkers back. The information in these videos shows undeniable proof that N.A.S.A and the United States Military as well as some other countries have knowledge that the Moon is inhabited. This is why they have never been back. This video will also provide reasonable understanding that the recent Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) was another hoax only to cover the endless lies that Nasa has been feeding the public. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) life footage had defects in the footage because they believe all people are naive and so dumb that believing that Nasa is making progress after 40 plus years in exploration of the moon again. See the truth in these 3-4 presentations then I dare anyone who don't want to believe what is being told here to download the original and do the research. If you don���t want to do the school work, why go to school. Many will not want to accept what they see with their own eyes, only because they believe the lie and are in denial. The evidence is undeniable."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"06/30/1969 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"21028","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":[""],"Summary":"Nasa Released footage of Ufos landing on Command Module life on Moon Government Cover up Must see!","Longitude":"-99.892113","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"12/17/2009 01:41 UTC","Latitude":"31.973489","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","Region":"Texas","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.973489,+-99.892113(21028)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21028) map </A>","Object Shape":"Blimp, Boomerang, Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Cone, Circle, Diamond, Disc, Egg, Oval, Saturn-like, Sphere, Square, Rectagular, Star-like, Teardrop, Triangle, Other, Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21028.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21028.html"],"Log Number":"US-12172009-0002"}
