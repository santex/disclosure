I was up on the deck looking at stars because it was a clear night. We did see some meteors and satellites but this was Completely different. I went down stairs for a min and then went back up to lay on the lounge chair so I could see as much of the night sky as possible. just as I was about to sit, I looked up and I thought i saw another shooting star but their were 2 and there were going the same speed then passing each other. Almost like they were trying to get away from something, at least that's what I thought at the time. They were a yellowish orange color. I said out loud, \"What the F was that?\" then I ran down stairs to tell everyone. This all took place in a matter of 3 to 4 seconds. I know what I saw and if you told me the same story, i would understand why its so hard to believe but I now know, I yelled, \"I saw you....\" Anyway, thats all I can tell you. Very sincerely Mike"],"Date Submitted":"08/05/2013 06:32 UTC","Object Shape":"Egg","Object Features":"None","Country":"United States","City":"Ocean City","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Ocean City","There were no other sightings in Ocean City on or around August 5th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49506.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49506.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:03","Log Number":"US-08052013-0030"}
