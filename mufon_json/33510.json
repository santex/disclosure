It was about 8:30 at night, and very dark, but lit up by a lot of lights on campus. We had just parked and I got out of the car and looked up and saw an object moving above the treeline from East to West in a straight line and it was glowing. I pointed it out to my friend and she couldn't figure out what it was either. It was noiseless and left me very puzzled. It was definitely not a plane or helicopter. The only thing I could compare it to would be an ultralight maybe, but I don't think they are used at night, and I didn't see any people. I was kind of shocked, but still wondering what I saw. The object went behind some buildings on campus and off in the distance."],"Longitude":"-88.25361","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
