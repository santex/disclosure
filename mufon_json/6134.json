(my house was located about two miles away from the historic zapotec ruins of monte alban and so people were passing by my neighborhood all the time trying to get there,the house was located on top of a hill and very few houses existed around it back then, the other hills also had houses scadered all over so all the homes were visible to eachother )......i remember sitting in the yard of my house playing with a stick and a toy car ,i leaned over to reach for a bag of something but i lost balance and fell on my side. when i picked my self up i, i looked across to the other hill (about 1\\8 of a mile)and noticed that something bright and shinny was hovering over my neighbor's house(at that time in my life i had no concept of aliens or ufos). i went inside my house and called my two sisters, they were about seven and ten years older than i. we went outside and just stood there and watched the bright obeject hover or the neighbor's house. it was almost as if someone was using a huge mirror and was holding it perfectly still and then moving it about 90-100ft in the air. the object was bright no matter what movement it made, it would go up in a perfect line and then come back down, it would also move to the sides super fast and then stay ferfectly still. at some point the object came down to the front of the house and remained unmoved for about 2 minutes, we did not say anything to eachother because we were still trying to figureout what it was in our heads. finally the object got up to about 50ft off from the top of the house and it slowly faded, until we couldn't see any of it anymore. our neighbor was not home, she worked at the local market and her children were at church at the time, only one other neighbor saw the ufo and they were freaked out by it, i had no idea why, but they were praying like crazy for the next few days. i had forgotten about the incident until about three years ago when my family was having dinner and we started talking about our old house, then i realised i had witnessed a ufo along time ago."],"Date Submitted":"07/30/1991 12:00 UTC"}
