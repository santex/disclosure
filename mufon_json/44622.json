{"Latitude":"42.203423","Summary":"gold colored spheres hovering over barn; left & returned in split second","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy aunt and I saw 3 or more gold colored spheres hover over the barn on the farm;they rotated individually and around each other. They left vertically in a split second, and returned a few minutes later, and then again abruptly left in a split second. They were completely silent, and I am sure they were not weather balloons, because of the speed and maneuvers they were doing. It was along time ago,in 1959, but I have never forgot, and have never reported this to anyone."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.203423,+-75.423838(44622)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44622) map </A>","City":"Bainbridge","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Longitude":"-75.423838","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Bainbridge","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"44622","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"00:00:06","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44622.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44622.html"],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"New York","Log Number":"US-12182012-0005","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"07/15/1959 12:00 UTC","Date Submitted":"12/18/2012 03:59 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
