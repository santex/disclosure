what would i do? is it piloted by someone\\ something good or bad?\" it then stopped and hovered briefly and the appeared to teleport back close to where it was before it headed towards me (it was still high up ). it then started to fly in a circle. it did that about 4 or 5 times then stopped, hovering for a few seconds before it started \"teleporting\" in a square. it did that for about 1 minute before it flew in the circle again. it repeated the circle, square, circle pattern several more times before it stopped. it starting blinking randomly and flew forward as if it was coming back towards be but stopped and \"teleported\" back to its spot it was at once again. it did this 3 times and then stopped blinking. it got brighter for a few seconds or so before it repeated the circle, square patter again. i thought maybe they or it was up there watching the meteor shower as this whole time there were random meteors shooting in the sky for a bit. this was all about 76-80 degrees up from where i was looking traveling up and down, closer and then back. before i knew it it was about 15-20 mins i was out there watching this. i decided to run inside real quick hoping it would still be there when i got back. i ran inside grabbed some binoculars and a digital camcorder, but when i came back it was gone. i was only inside a minute at most. i waited a few more mins watched a few shooting stars and went back inside taking note of the time 3:21am. it was a very cool site, something i have never seen before. i stayed up for 2 more hours going back outside to see if it would come back but it never did. i had check to see if it was the iss but it was not nor was it a satillite. i laid in bed thinking that maybe it had been spotted earlier and that is why there was so much air traffic when i went outside earlier, and why there could have been a helicopter patrolling the air above a home land security building."],"Summary":"Craft flew west then stopped, ascended, turned upside down made a 90 degree turn teleported appeared else where multiple times second craft flew off from the first","Latitude":"39.271148","Sighting Duration":"00:17:00","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"44554","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Ellicott City","There were no other sightings in Ellicott City on or around December 14th 2012"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","Date Submitted":"12/14/2012 05:17 UTC","Object Shape":"Diamond, Sphere, Star-like","Tags":"City","Region":"Maryland","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-76.794467"}
