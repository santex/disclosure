Wached for about 5-7 minutes, to high to video, but plenty of pics. Called Nephew out to side yard to see. He did not believe, until he saw it; we watched together, while I used my Rebel TI3 12.2 MP,with 300MM zoon lense (did not have tripod) took plenty of pics; went inside to put on computer; had to zoon in 300% to get good look. Seemed to be changing shape during path, like another I took at same place, approximate time of day, three years prior (report on MUFON). Made some photoshop moves to bring out contrast."],"Date Submitted":"01/10/2012 08:00 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","City":"San Jose","Log Number":"US-01102012-0018","Region":"California","Case Number":"34773"}
