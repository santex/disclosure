Then I noticed that it was traveling at a level and even rate of speed. It demonstated the \"falling leaf\" pattern as it moved through the air showing the \"topside\"towards us then flip up and expose the \"bottom\" . The top reflected a dull white but the bottom gave the impression of a flat black and flat surface. Not quite round but sort of morphing as it traveled, gaining altitude but speed still even. Observed an aircraft , private I believe, that flew through the space that the ufo just traversed, and appeared to turn back to check out this object.We watched it for a total of about 10 mins. My mental rolodex was telling me what it was not until I came to the conclusion that we had observed a U F O. Not the first for me, but it never fails to amaze one. It ended when it disappeared in a cloud formation at about 30k feet."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"07/23/2013 02:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Other","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
