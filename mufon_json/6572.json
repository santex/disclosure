The object on a picture just showed up above the city for 2 minutes (when I noticed the object, i went to my room, powered up my camera and has a few seconds remain just fot one shot) 1. Planes do not fly above this area of the city. 2. Too bright for the star and for the plane, no blink lights 3. Showed up and suddenly disappered. Moved quickly. Planes do not fly that fast. Hard to tell the distance - over 10 miles definitely"]}
