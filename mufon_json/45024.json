{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Other,Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:00:04","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was taking pictures of another amazing sunset from a spot I frequently visit. The sky was giving off some lightning from a south west direction and I was switching from video to photo just trying to capture a shot of lightning. Using my IPhone in picture mode I started taking pictures working from a north west to a south west sweep overlapping each shot and back again. Never did I see the object with my eyes. Maybe I was looking in a different direction, I don't know? I do know the pictures were taken about 2 seconds apart, using my IPhone. It was on the next day, reviewing the pictures I took when I noticed a spot I thought was glare on the picture. I flipped to the next picture and the same spot showed up again. I zoomed in on the picture thinking it must have been an airplane moving through the field reflecting the sun, and then I further discovered it looks as though the objects are going in different directions.
