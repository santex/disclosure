My father or I never reported it. But what we saw is still vivid to me. My family & close friends know of the story, but some still don't believe. Some how this is a closure of an event that has had me wondering for years. My Mom , Dad & I had gone to a public lake for the day to swim. My Dad & I were in the water, my Mom was on the beach I had come up from swimming under water, I was about chest deep. It is then I saw to silver disk shaped objects hovering over the beach area. I don't remember how far or how high the objects were, but they were about the size of a small plate & they were still & silent. My Dad came up fom under water beside me. I was pointing to the objects. We both tried to get the attention of my Mom or anyone else, but the objects shot off at a right angle & disappeared in the sky traveling VERY fast. We knew wright away what it was. I haven't seen any thing like it again."],"Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.887126,+-94.815198(46849)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46849) map </A>","Case Number":"46849","Date Submitted":"04/19/2013 12:42 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.815198","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-04192013-0014","Latitude":"38.887126"}
