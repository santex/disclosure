{"Summary":"Photograph of twister showed two UFO's when viewed later.","Weather Factors":"None","Case Number":"12996","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"51.510789","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was lying on my bed reading a magazine when I noticed what appeared to be the start of a twister forming. My bed faced two large windows which gave me a panoramic view of the Sussex country side. Obviously for the UK any form of twister is quite a strange event but I resisted the temptation to take a photograph. I went back to my magazine but would check every couple of minutes to see how it (the twister) was progressing. In the end I succumbed to temptation and took this photo on my mobile phone(Sony Ericsson D750i). I then went back to my magazine and forgot all about it. In early February 2008 after moving to a new house I needed my mobile phone to take a picture of our electricity meter in order to provide evidence to our utility company. Of course this meant downloading all the images from my phone to my PC and it was here that I also viewed my other images taken months before. To my amazement the twister image has to disc shapes in the upper right hand corner of the picture. I swear to god that these were not there at the time. I couldn���t see them with the naked eye. You can see from the photo that I am aiming my camera at the twister. If I'd have seen those at the time I'd be looking at them for sure. Despite repeated attempts we have failed to reproduce this image. I'm still thinking that it's a cloud of some description but that fails to explain why I did not see them at the time. A strange event then, What do you make of it?"],"trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around December 7th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"City":"London","Disposition":"Unresolved","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"12/07/2007 03:46 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12996.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/12996_submitter_file1__DSC00264.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12996.html"],"Region":"England","Date of the Event":"12/07/2007 03:46 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.510789,+-0.123895(12996)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12996) map </A>","Country":"United Kingdom","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-0.123895","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Unknown","Tags":"City","Log Number":"GB-10102008-0005"}
