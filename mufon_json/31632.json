{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is a follow up from a previous report where drawings were provided. I managed to get video of the brightest light that appears in the eastern sky above Roswell and it has been changing locations more frequently. Before it was stationary in the east in a location approximately 70 degrees from horizon and later would be 90 degrees (around 2-3 AM). Lately it has been very low (about 30 degrees) and remains stationary; three to four hours later is at 70 degrees, and by 4 AM is at 90 degrees and much brighter and appears larger. It has also migrated to the south and there have been three other very bright lights appear in an arc formation in the brightest one's original location. Formation is at 25, 50, and 75 degrees with pulsating lights flashing red, green, blue. They all appear the same through binoculars. Attached video is of the brightest one in the eastern sky on September 5, 2011 at approximately 10:30 PM."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09082011-0001","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.436416,+-104.527476(31632)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31632) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/08/2011 01:00 UTC","Case Number":"31632","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31632.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31632.html"],"Latitude":"33.436416","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Roswell","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Bright pulsing lights every night.
