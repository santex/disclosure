We were returning to California from a business trip to Sierra Vista, Arizona. After dinner in Ajo we headed north. We first observed 4 lights off to the west, they were stationary and we were familiar with the area and knew they were no on a mountain of structure. They did gradually disappear and then reappear in the east, then disappear and re appear again in the west. I was able to get closer to the lights when they reappeared in the west. I stopped the car and watched closely. I believed I observed smoke coming from one of the end lights. I personally suspect that this is air force related and that what I was observing was an array of lights on an object; however I am an engineer and would expect the lights to be flashing, I would conclude that if this was for some military use that may not be the case. I am think this may be related to the ���Phoenix Lights���, but I guess that is what makes the a UFO."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Berry Goldwater AFB","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Region":"Arizona","Summary":"A four light array, at times only 1 light and then growing to 4","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46576.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46576.html"],"City":"Berry Goldwater AFB","Longitude":"-111.088101","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"34.054038","Date Submitted":"04/03/2013 05:10 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Other","Date of the Event":"09/15/2006 08:30 UTC"}
