I tryed to get my fathers attention and every time he looked they stopped but then we both saw the circles zip across the sky and disappear we were both astonished."],"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-79.592035","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Very bright zig zagging across night sky 12 - 12:30am","Case Number":"50272","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50272.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50272.html"],"Log Number":"CA-08292013-0019","Country":"Canada","Latitude":"44.562051","Object Shape":"Disc, Oval, Sphere","City":"Oro Medonte","Region":"Ontario","Date of the Event":"08/24/2013 12:00 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Oro Medonte","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
