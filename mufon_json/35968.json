Object, appears as a star. then moves around, up, down, back, forth, diagonal, circular. goes & stops on a dime. The first time, I wondered if my eyes were playing tricks on me. But, I quickly realized what I was seeing. This isn't the first time. So, I feel thrilled & happy. Don't want to take my eyes off of them. I lose sight when either moring comes, or I fall asleep.
