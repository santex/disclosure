On the second night of the trip, we were all looking at the stars on a clear evening, when there was a flash like lightning and we saw a large triangular object about 500 to 1000 feet above us, and then in a split second it was gone, and there was another flash very far away, and then three more flashes further and further away in a split second. It was like a plane took off and in the blink of a eye went from right above you to one thousand miles away. We all witnessed it and were a little shocked. I realized it couldn't have been anything from this planet's current technology, and one of my companions said, \"I didn't just see that\" to which I replied, \"yes you did, we all did\"."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15827.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15827.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-03042009-0002","Date Submitted":"08/25/2004 11:00 UTC","Date of the Event":"08/25/2004 11:00 UTC","Case Number":"15827"}
