(the light\\object also seemed to be fairly spherical.) as the light\\object changed color it also began to lose altitude. it then passed out of view behind trees and the hillside. i noted the time to be 1:05am. the time that the light\\object took from when it changed direction until it disappeared from view also was maybe 30-40 seconds. through out the observation i heard no noise from the light\\object, nor did i see any smoke or emissions. about an hour later i also observed a set of three individual flashes of bright white light that flashed with a pause of about 6-8 seconds between. these small point flashes appeared higher above the horizon in what seemed to be a triangular pattern. i thought they could be a very high altitude airplane, but there was only single point of light in each flash, not a cluster of several lights (and not in a typical flight path that i have seen before.) and to my surprise (again) there was a dim flash of light (like a shooting star) only it went up towards where i had observed the three light flashes. connected?? coincidence??"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Summary":"Hovering bright orange-yellow object then moved slowly, at least 2 glowing objects dropped from it. color changed to blue-white.","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-122.125202","Object Shape":"Sphere","Log Number":"US-09032013-0007","Case Number":"50387","Date of the Event":"09/02/2013 01:05 UTC","Latitude":"38.021786","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50387.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50387.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/03/2013 07:21 UTC","City":"Martinez","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Martinez","There were no other sightings in Martinez on or around September 2nd 2013"],"Source":"MUFON"}
