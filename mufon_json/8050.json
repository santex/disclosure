i looked at the clock it was 12 midnight exactly, i looked at our baby in the crib she was facing me, looked back at the hallway i saw a small fat brown blobby thing, with some what of a childs face! but just blobby, it looked really weird, then a head of something grey popped threw the hallwall wall, then it slowly stepped into the hallway from out side and they just stood there looking at me, lol, i stood up and just stood there just to see a taller bluish-gray looking thing step threw our wall into the hallway, this thing was huge and thin!, and it was acting dainty like, it put its hand out towards me and for some reason i walked to it!, i wasnt scared at all! and i turned around and the two smaller ones were infront of me, the gray little one looked at me and when i looked in my room and the baby was still facing where i would be sleeping and my husband was still sleeping in the babies same direction as well and my side of the bed was empty!, i looked at the clock, it was not 12:01am exactly, i was still holding the large beings hand \"finger tip\\thumb holding\", we stepped threw the wall and into their craft,the interior was pearlized white\\cream like in color, when i touched the wall, there was like a slight glow around my hand and fingers, the seats were molded into the wall, there was some translucence to the walls of the craft, where ever we went to, you can see the night turn into day, it went from dark to light really fast durring that travel, in the middle of the craft i saw this weird bulb light thing, i walked to it \"it was humming and yo could feel vibrating air like around it\" i went to put my right hand on it and the short fat brown being grabbed my wrist, his hand\\thing felt like sand paper! the little gray in between the two put his hand up to where the brown one saw his hand and let go of my hand, then the huge bluish gray thing pointed to the wall, so i looked at the wall and the craft was either stopped or it slowed down to a still, it was lit out side, then the tallest one looked down, so i looked down and the craft slowly dipped the bottom of the craft into water, we were in water! then it plunged downward and i looked up as they did and i saw a beautiful coral reef, you could see some fish swimming all around, some plants, i remember a huge yellow fish with a blue striped next to the wall of the craft, then i looked at the things you have the brown on on my left the gray in the middle and the bluish-gray on my right, the little gray said \"we do exist\" ((mentally)) his mouth did not move! then they looked out into the water, the craft pulled up slowly out of the water, the walls became slightly non-trandlucent again, the craft took off then it went from light to dark! before i knew it the tall being came to my side to lead me back to my place ((my hallway, we stood back in my hall way)) i looked up at this being and for some reason it made me feel like as though it was a female, she must of been between 6-7 feet huge wrap around pit shaped jel like eyes, she had fat hairs lining the bottom of her eyes, and on the tight areas of the facial skin there were bumps or pits, maybe like poors or blemishes! i dont know, no expressions! but it seems very calm, and dainty like, i believe the other two were male, they just acted differently from the tallest one, anyway looking at her, i wasnt scared but i looked into my room and the clock now said 12:15am exactly!, my husband and baby were sleeping in the opposite direction and my side of the bed was still empty! i crawled back into bed, looked at her as she went threw the wall and gone from my life! from that day one, i have had a new prospective about life else where and where they may be hiding out! and i also hear destorted windpipe chime noises \"very rarely\" but i dont know what it is! i can draw this as well if you would like. just let me know."],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-10042007-0003","Summary":"Small Ovel Pit like","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less"}
