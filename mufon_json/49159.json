----------------------------------------- 7\\11\\2013 received an e-mail from chuck zukowski about a cow mutilation case in henry county. i spoke to the witness today and she stated following: the rancher found the cow yesterday, july 10 in the north side of her property. it was lying dead on her left side, with her rear end, tongue, and udder removed. the witness did not raise the head of the cow to look at the second eye. the witness had driven by the night before, but did not see anything, however, it was dark and the cow is black so it may have been there. the cow had maggots on it, so it had been there at least a couple of days. it has been very hot, up to 100 degrees and very dry. the witness saw vultures on her on july 10. the witness said that normally birds will fly around when something dies, but they were not there before july 10. it was 100 degrees at the time she found the cow so it is decomposing rapidly. she has registered black angus cows and this one was her best, a 7 ���year old in her prime that would have produced more calves in the future. the cow was worth $2,000. she wonders if it was random or if whoever\\whatever did this was looking for the best of the herd. the witness has not seen any other cows going near this one. note: the witness says that as of today - july 24 - no coyotes have eaten on the carcasses. this is not normal. -------------------------------- dec 2011 a mutilated heifer calf was found on the site with its tongue and female genitalia removed and part of the jaw tissue and muscle removed to the bone. the rancher buried the calf at that time. ---------------------------------- i made two youtube videos with interviews with the witness"],"Longitude":"-93.960774"}
