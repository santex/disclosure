It was several years ago in November around 7:00 PM after dark. I looked over the top of the water tower and saw a very large dark object with the shape of a boomergang. Along the back edge were 12 to 16 orange lights about a foot in diameter. Between 5 to 10 seconds later the lights went out or the object disapeared. I checked with the sheriff's office and no one had reported anything. During the next several years I did talk to severel people who had seen the object but didn't report it in fear of calling in a hoax. I know them all very well with one being a wildlife officer. I was in the Army National Guard for 21 years and retired as a Major. I was also on the local volunteer fire depatment for 34 years and was chief for 16 of those years."],"Object Features":"None","Date Submitted":"08/04/2012 06:59 UTC","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.796628,+-83.532991(41427)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41427) map </A>","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Log Number":"US-08042012-0026","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There have been no other sightings in West Union","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Case Number":"41427"}
