Saw the object moving slowly in an Easterly direction. It was in the same area as commercial planes take. It looked like the deepest red I ever saw and it pulsed bright and dim. It made a low Humming sound. It appeared to have lines through it like some texture of a lens. I could see no other structure to it. It was not a plane or helicopter nor balloon. I continued to watch it until it disappeared in the East. It just got smaller and then it was gone. I have never seen an object like this before. I have reported an UFO before in the same area about a month or so ago."]}
