It seemed to be moving from west (over the Gulf of Mexico) inland. It looked somewhat like a plane only much closer and bigger, and it was moving more slowly. Part of it or all of appeared to be on fire. We watched it for 2-3 minutes, went inside to get a camera, and then it was gone. Neither of us could identify it although we agreed it was not a plane. We thought it might possibly have been a flaming lantern like some we've seen in Thailand, but it was very high up and lasted a long time. Anyone else see it?"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"01/20/2013 06:40 UTC","Summary":"Saw bright, apparently flaming object in sky over Holmes Beach for about 3 minutes.","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Holmes Beach","There were no other sightings in Holmes Beach on or around January 20th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.706215","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.506778,+-82.706215(45355)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45355) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/21/2013 05:08 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"27.506778","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45355.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45355.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown"}
