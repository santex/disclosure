Time about 3:15 AM. I took the exit for P���Tree Corners Circle and as I go onto that road headed north, I saw a brightly-lit something straight ahead, at a distance, above the trees. I thought it was a fire truck or rescue truck, I���m thinking ���what the heck is that?��� I kept an eye on it as I kept going, it was getting brighter as if maybe I was getting closer. It was huge, the size of a subdivision, with very bright red & white lights all over it. I couldn���t see a shape, it was dark and the lights just too bright. Finally, not believing this at all, I just brought the car to a complete stop. This was just before the intersection of Corners, with Holcomb Bridge Rd. I got my head out of the driver side window and got a good look at it. I just could not believe the size and brightness. It began or had just begun, to move, headed SE like towards Doraville. I turned right to get over to my house to get a camera but when I came back to that spot, it was gone."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"16850","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Georgia","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16850.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16850.html"],"Summary":"Huge, very bright red & white-lit object over road close to my home, Norcross, GA.","Log Number":"US-05092009-0008","Longitude":"-84.24677","Date of the Event":"04/25/2009 03:15 UTC","trends":["There have been 10 other sightings in Norcross","There were no other sightings in Norcross on or around April 25th 2009"],"Latitude":"33.959115","Object Shape":"Oval, Unknown","City":"Norcross","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.959115,+-84.24677(16850)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16850) map </A>"}
