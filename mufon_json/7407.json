At or about 6:55 PM I noticed a dark, small object low in the sky. At first, I thought it to be somebody's kite that had become loose. As it approached, I observed it was a rectangular object about 6 feet by 4 feet, dark gray in color. It made no noise whatever. Conditions were sunny and dry. There was an intermitant small breeze. The object approached to within 50 feet of my location and was about 50 feet up. It seemed to have yellow reflectors at each corner which caught sunlight. The object made small jerking motions and revealed itself in profile as well as full face. It was thin, probably no thicker than an inch. There were no wires nor strings attached. At the point closest to me, it seemed to hang in the air. I kept waiting for it to fall, but it did not. Finally, it moved beyond a tree line and I saw it no longer. It was one of the most odd things I have ever seen."],"Date Submitted":"07/09/2007 06:55 UTC","Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"observed rectangular object in the sky which had no apparent reason to be airborne","Case Number":"7407","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.970709,+-99.896853(7407)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7407) map </A>","trends":[],"Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-99.896853","Object Features":"Other","Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7407.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7407.html"]}
