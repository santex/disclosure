The back of my house faces the south. I noticed two stars in the southern sky that seemed a little brighter than most of the other stars out that night. After a moment it occured to me that I had never seen these stars before and when I realized this I noticed that they were moving. At first I thought they might be aircraft or possibly satellites but I quickly discounted those possibilites because of the fast pace at which they were moving. One of the craft followed at a consistant interval and they were traveling from due south to due north one behind the other. When they passed a point that was just past overhead, they seemed to stop and accelerate away from the earth at a high rate of speed that caused their star-like appearance to fade away as the lights grew dim and they disappeared into space."],"Region":"Louisiana","Latitude":"32.253213","Summary":"Two star-like craft traverse the night sky at atypical speed","Log Number":"US-05252010-0002","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23431.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23431.html"],"Longitude":"-93.165722","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"23431","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Castor","Date of the Event":"05/22/2010 10:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.253213,+-93.165722(23431)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23431) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/25/2010 12:11 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
