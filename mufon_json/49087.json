One of them said what are those lights in the sky? We all got up to look and all saw the same lights. Started with just two. Moved across from the East to northeast, then stopped forward motion, one headed more north then faded away, the other stayed in one spot then faded away. Another came across a little later, did the same thing. I went to grab a camera but couldn't focus on it. Went to grab a different camera from my car, saw another coming on the same path.Managed to video it but couldn't zoom enough. This was the last one we saw."],"Date of the Event":"07/20/2013 10:30 UTC","City":"Pitt Meadows","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-122.689516","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"4 or 5 lights moving in, hovering then fading away","Object Flight Path":"Path then hovering","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49087.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49087.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=49.219065,+-122.689516(49087)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49087) map </A>","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Pitt Meadows","There were no other sightings in Pitt Meadows on or around July 20th 2013","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"CA-07212013-0008","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"British Columbia","Case Number":"49087"}
