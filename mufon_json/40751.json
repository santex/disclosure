I assumed that it was a firework for independence day. However, it was too large and traveled at a steady rate for too long. At one point, once it had past Bell rd. it shifted direction and appeared to be heading toward us. My wife felt uncomfortable and headed indoors stating \"It's coming toward us!\" I remained watching for a few more seconds as it approached, then it shifted suddenly at a rapid rate and shot off toward the northwest valley. After a few more seconds, I could no longer see it. Shared the story with others, but was unconvinced of what I saw until I noticed others had seen the same orange orb."],"City":"Phoenix","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"07/04/2012 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Fiery Orange orb moving north, shifting east, then shifting northwest at rapid rate then disappeared","Date Submitted":"07/12/2012 07:37 UTC","Log Number":"US-07122012-0025","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"40751","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.657986","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40751.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40751.html"],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Longitude":"-112.079382","Region":"Arizona","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.657986,+-112.079382(40751)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40751) map </A>"}
