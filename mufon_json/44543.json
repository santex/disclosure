{"Longitude":"-82.262937","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving between Harlem and Dearing Georgia. I noticed light in the sky and thought they looked different so I slowed down to take a closer look. The object I saw had 5 bright white lights in a perfect triangle pattern. The object was very low, approximately 500-1000 feet. It was moving so slowly that when I slowed down it appeared as though I was moving to it. When I was at my closest distance to it, all 5 lights flickered one time. The flickered, but it didn't seem like a flicker. It was more like a trembling of the lights. I didn't think to pull over to record it. I was working and had to get to my destination. When I first saw it, I had no clue what it was. I've spent numerous hours in military aircraft to include many hours in the skies over Iraq, and I've never seen a military aircraft that even comes close to resembling what I saw."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.447807,+-82.262937(44543)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44543) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44543.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44543.html"],"Date of the Event":"12/06/2012 08:15 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","Log Number":"US-12142012-0007","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Harlem","There were no other sightings in Harlem on or around December 6th 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"12/14/2012 08:43 UTC","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.447807","Region":"Georgia","Summary":"Large slow moving triangle with five white lights.
