It was to the north of my house. I noticed it was moving slowly towards the direction of my house. My first thought was ufo and then I said to myself its probably a satellite or something. I then continued to do the trash after I finished I returned to look at it. As soon I returned the object got brighter and it split into two objects. Both objects looked smaller now and one remained in the same spot while the other one went off to the east. They both disappeared about 7 seconds after the split. After the sighting I was pretty excited to have seen that but I was also disappointed with my self for not getting a video camera when I first saw it. I waited for about 20 minutes to see if it would reappear then went inside."],"Case Number":"28023","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/27/2011 07:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-02272011-0011","Summary":"Orange star moving splits into 2 then gone","Country":"United States","Latitude":"33.124517","Region":"California","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
