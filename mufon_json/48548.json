(it was not a helicopter with a spotlight, for there was absolutely no sound at all. it also wasn't a shooting star- of which i have seen hundreds throughout my lifetime. it was moving much too slow to be a shooting star....) so, i turned to my sister, and reluctantly said, \"ummm, did you just see that?\" she says \"yeah, i did...\" then i replied, \"good, cause for a moment i thought i was hallucinating!\" but we weren't. now, here's the kicker... i have always wanted to see an \"ufo\"... as far back as i can remember, i've been fascinated by the thought my entire life. but- after having actually seen one with my own eyes... to my surprise, i didn't have the desire to 'tell everyone' and\\or share my experience with others. i've told maybe 2-3 close friends, and posted it on this page, and that's as far as i have gone with any 'disclosure' about the incident. what's interesting to note, is that we were only 10 miles from where the famous \"allagash abduction\" took place, on eagle lake. i'm still trying to find a logical explanation for what we saw, and so far, i have nothing."]}
