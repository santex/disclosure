Very clear night. Saw two white lights in the distance to the east flying west. Thought it might be two lights on either wing of a conventional airplane at first. As it got closer it became obvious it was not. As it flew over at about 2,000 to 4,000 ft. (best estimate). It became obvious it was a triangle. It had 7 lights on it. One large red light in the center and 6 smaller white lights. There were three white lights on the front edge, two on each edge in the middle with the red light in between and one at the point which was the rear of the object. It made a low hum and was reasonably large. If I had to guess, i would say one hundred feet or more across at the widest point. The object was flying somewhat slow as I would say that I watched it for one minute or more to go from east horizon to west out of sight. My brother pulled up as it was directly overhead and he could see it leaving to the west."],"Date of the Event":"03/03/2011 01:05 UTC","Date Submitted":"03/03/2011 02:33 UTC","Case Number":"28063","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
