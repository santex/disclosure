{"Summary":"brilliant white fast moving intermitant strobe","City":"Peru","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe had a birthday party on this date. My wife at about 11:43 PM took a trash bag to the trash can. While she was at the trash can a bright flash of light filtered through the trees. She stepped out onto the road and watched as this light flashed two more times as it traveled south down the road. She ran to the house to get me and my daughter, grandson. The four of us scanned the sky to the south from the yard. Nothing was observed so we went to the road. We scanned the sky from north, west to south. Nothing was observed for several minutes. My grandson first noticed a strobe flash to the SSW at about one fourth of a mile coming over top of a small woods. I picked it up then and we both watched it come on a direct line at us. It moved fast and was low to the ground. Probably not more that 150 feet from the ground. It would strobe, then it wouldn't strobe again for about a second and had moved a distance of maybe 100 yards. As it approached us the strobe turned east before it got the end of the yard. My grandson lost sight of it then. I moved back into the yard and watched this strobe continue east for about one fourth of a mile where it cleared the top of another woods and disappeared."],"Latitude":"40.757853","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12363.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12363.html"],"Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-09062008-0007","trends":["There have been 19 other sightings in Peru","There were 2 other sightings in Peru on or around July 26th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Indiana","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.757853,+-86.063471(12363)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12363) map </A>","Case Number":"12363","Date of the Event":"07/26/2008 11:45 UTC","Longitude":"-86.063471","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"07/26/2008 11:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash","Object Features":"None"}
