After they faded away another light about the same distance flew by and turned extremely fast, way to fast for the speed it was going and then slowly faded away also. Before and after I witnessed the lights I had seen a few different types of commercial aircraft flying by at different altitudes which is common in this area. Seeing those aircrafts gave me perspective on the speed, maneuverability and altitude of the lights which made me assume they were not of this world. This isn't the first time I've seen strange lights in this area and I am familiar with the maneuverability of fighter jets and military helicopters and am positive that my sightings were neither of those or any other type of man made aircraft."],"Country":"United States"}
