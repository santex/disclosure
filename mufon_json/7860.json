Stepped down to the sidewalk and the looked over the house to the south. I looked about 70 degrees high in the southern sky & 20 degrees west of south. Pretty sure venus set around 10:30PM & Saturn set around 2:30AM. Object was stationary and seemed to reflect light. Thought it was venus at first. Watched for only 5 seconds & then heard in my head,\" uh oh, he sees us.\" Then it just winked out. Sounded like two men talking normally saying this. Yep, it's weird to me too. Stood there for a few more seconds to try to figure it out. No explanations. Went inside at 4:51 and told my wife, \"you won't believe what I just saw.\" She said,\"a UFO.\" I said yes. That's it. Post script: I am a private pilot if that helps.
