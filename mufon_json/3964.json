Mrs. Walace one school day out of no where started talking about ufo's and whiether they are real or not. Then goings on to mention she has a son in the military that informed her that ufo's are true cause he's seen one the military has. I metioned this to one of my friends Tom Moses a couple years later to see if he remembered what Mrs. Walace said about ufo's being real and he didn't but I still do. So, I doubt others in the class remember it too seeing how so many years have passed. Surely Mrs. Walace died many years ago since she was like 60+ in the 70's. But I figured her son might still be alive with ufo information if only you could locate him. I believe Mrs. Walac only had 1 son so he shouldn't be too hard to find. Good luck."],"Case Number":"3964","Date Submitted":"11/30/1975 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
