It was just sitting there suspended in the air and if not for the lights from the nearby casino, The South Coast Casino I probably would not even have seen it as it had no lights of its own. I watched it until it just kind of disappeared out of sight. I was not on any kind of drug, alcohol, or any thing and I consider myself to be of very sound mind. I've always said that until I see one I will not believe it and I definitely saw this and I know that it was a UFO."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.120756,+-115.166466(16830)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16830) map </A>","Case Number":"16830","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-115.166466","trends":["There have been 229 other sightings in Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in Las Vegas on or around October 18th 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"10/18/2008 09:30 UTC","Latitude":"36.120756","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16830.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16830.html"],"Log Number":"US-05072009-0016","Sighting Duration":"00:02:10","Object Shape":"Triangle","Weather Factors":"None"}
