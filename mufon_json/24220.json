As I was in the house at that time, when I came back out she tryed to describe to me what she had seen. We sat there looking to the south for about 20-30 minutes when another red-orange object appeared out of the south just as she had described. This object appeared as a bright ball of fire when first appearing out of the south. When it seemed to be directly above us it took a different shape sort of resembling a rocket or missile. After it passed over us to the north we could see it as a faint light in the sky for maybe 30 seconds. 3 more of these same objects came out of the southern sky the last occuring at about 11:30pm CT. These objects were like nothing we have ever seen."],"trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Clarksville","There were no other sightings in Clarksville on or around July 4th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Weather Factors":"None","Longitude":"-87.355023","Sighting Duration":"02:00:00","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Fireball, Oval, Sphere, Star-like","City":"Clarksville","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Features":"Other","Log Number":"US-07052010-0070","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"07/05/2010 04:55 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/04/2010 09:30 UTC","Summary":"Saw total 5 unknown orange glowing objects fly over in 2-hour span.","Latitude":"36.536191","Country":"United States","Case Number":"24220"}
