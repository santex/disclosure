i can���t explain i know they were standing there but it was very different. then like nothing flat we was standing in the front yard watching the shape fly over the south western, mountain range when the shape was out of my sight two jets had past over in the same direction. i will never forget what i saw that night nor what happened the thing i think that bothers me the most was that my friend and i never spoke about it again only that night after it happened. we both said to each other how weird that was and how it was as if it really didn���t happen. shortly after that event my father was in the house and we had went to him to explain what just happened which seemed to be only minutes, we told him about the shape and the jets and his reply was he had be looking for us over an hour, and that he had not seen us standing in the front or side of the house. my dad had said that my friend���s parents had called to let them know it was time to come home and said he could not find us. after that my friend and i both just looked blank at each other and like unspoken words never talked about it again. we both after many year���s lost touch with each other and i wondered if they remember the same event that night. like i said i didn���t speak about it for many year���s until 1997 when my wife and i was at a drive-in. the drive-in is in south denver just off hampton and santa fe. it was the most profound thing i ever saw and the thing that really makes me think that we are not alone is that my wife and all of the drive-in saw the same shape in the sky, a white \\ grey shape in the north. it was for about 2mins and then was gone like that, during the few minutes it was there it seemed to be moving very slow and almost hovering. we both was looking at it and had noticed all the other people in there cars was doing the same at least the people around us was, i can���t say the rest was or not. after it had left we laughed about it and both said how weird was that? what was what? the folks next to us had yield over and asked if we saw the same thing as they did and we said yes. that night is when i finally told my story about the shape i was and what had happened. i will never forget about the feelings i had when telling my story, it was very hard to tell someone about it and it was as if i was going to die or something. the strange thing was it was like a distant story from the past i couldn���t remember but when i started to talk about that night it all came back so fast, i can���t write the greatest to talk about what i saw, i can only say the ordeal that night will never leave me or my thought���s, it is as if happened last night every detail is forever in my head. i have not seen anything since 1997 in the skies of colorado; i look up all the time wondering when i���ll get to see the shape again as if i need some kind of closure in my life."]}
