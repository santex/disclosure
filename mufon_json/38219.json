Noticed sky was really clear & lots of stars out, then saw that one was moving. Thought at first it was probably a high plane, figured just high enough that I couldn't see any blinking lights. Then I noticed this white light was getting brighter as if coming my direction. Suddenly the speed increased, then instantly it vanished. There were no clouds at all for it to hide behind, it just seemed to disappear instantly."],"Date Submitted":"05/18/2012 09:49 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
