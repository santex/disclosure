{"Case Number":"7058","divs":["sighting detailsmy wife and i were at polihale state park located on the north-west side of kauai. we viewed the sunset and were talking while observing the night sky. the quarter moon and venus, over the ocean was to my back, and a dipper star constellation was over my left shoulder, as i stood facing inland. at approximately 1930 hrs., while looking above the mountain range at the night sky i noticed what i thought to be a star at first, growing in size and light intensity. it expanded while keeping a perfectly circular shape, and it brightened in proportion to it's growing size. i'd estimate that at it's largest, it was just larger than a dime held at arms length. there seemed to be a smaller grey-ish circle at it's center. it remained enlarged for 5 seconds or so, and then began to decrease in size. startled, i tried to help my wife off the tailgate of the truck so she could see it. in doing so i looked away for a moment, and when i looked again, it now looked like just another star in the sky. it remained stationary for 5 seconds or so, then began to move in a south-easterly direction. i have observed satellites tracking through the evening sky, and it look like this except it moved abit faster than i've seen satellites travel. it tracked steady and straight till i could no longer see it. the only other experience of the evening, which i thought strange, was how disoriented i felt driving home, which is roughly a 20 minute drive, and for about an hour or so after returning. after some time to think about what we saw, i could only relate this to possibly being a stationary satellite that performed a 'burn' to be relocated although from my view and angle, the light never resembled that of what i would think a burning rocket motor to look like. furthermore, after sharing this with a friend today, she went online and showed me a satellite\\iss tracking page that shows what, if any, was visible at my location and time. nothing was overhead within 2 hours before, or after."],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Features":"None","Region":"Hawaii","Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-159.715","Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05212007-0004","Summary":"Star-like light in night sky grew in size and intensity, decreased in size and moved","City":"Kekaha","Date Submitted":"05/20/2007 07:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Star-like","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Kekaha","There were no other sightings in Kekaha on or around May 20th 2007"],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7058.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7058.html"],"Date of the Event":"05/20/2007 07:30 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=21.970833,+-159.715(7058)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7058) map </A>","Latitude":"21.970833"}
