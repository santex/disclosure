{"Weather Factors":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile outside enjoying the full moon on a clear evening in October my son and his friend saw a round silver ball 'dancing around the full moon' . Nothing we knew of from the air shows or otherwise could 'dance' like that around the moon. The boys had their cell phones 'handy' (love technology these days!) and took several frames. May post photographs later - but these shots are same as those posted in other places here - i.e., round silver balls...This time seeming to dance (moved all around) the full moon in the clear evening sky."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"9390","City":"Gardiner","Region":"Maine","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9390.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9390.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.23007,+-69.775322(9390)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (9390) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"round silver ball - 'dancing' around the full moon 10/24/2007 in Maine","Longitude":"-69.775322","Date of the Event":"10/24/2007 07:04 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","Latitude":"44.23007","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"10/24/2007 07:04 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Gardiner","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Log Number":"US-02012008-0009"}
