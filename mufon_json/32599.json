Excited as always. There could possibly be a few straysi looked up towards the sky. Looking at the stars. One star was blinking rapidly and a little larger thana normal star. Almost parallel to the moon off to the left. It was justhovering. It was low enough for there to be sound of a plane but no sound. Then I thought maybe I'm seeing a meteorite heading straight in. The red flashing and white were possible for something tummbling in. But the object never got closer larger or smaller it just stayed in the same spot for almost an hour. It suddenly just disappeared I thought I may also have watched a star burn out. Problem is that a star doeS not belong in that location in the sky. By the next morning 2 other people told me what they saw last night. I never told them what I had seen prior to them telling me."]}
