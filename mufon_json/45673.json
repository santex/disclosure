Immediately there, in the same area that I have seen other unexplainable things previously reported, I saw a bright yellow oval shaped star traveling level and steady for 5 seconds until it was behind a cloud. I kept looking for it to emerge, but it didn't. I had enough time to assess- not a plane, not a star, not a shooting star. A few hours later, the local military base had a searchlight doing a 45 degree back and forth pattern not directed at the area of my sighting. I have never seen the base use a searchlight before."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Latitude":"21.415657","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Kaneohe","There were no other sightings in Kaneohe on or around February 9th 2013"],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Kaneohe","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45673.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45673.html"],"Date Submitted":"02/11/2013 03:29 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"Hawaii","Case Number":"45673","Summary":"large oval shaped star traveled behind cloud, did not emerge","Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","Date of the Event":"02/09/2013 12:00 UTC"}
