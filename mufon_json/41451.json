As I was driving East on 307, I looked to my right, and saw 2 red orange Chinese lanterns in the sky. Moving slow and steady. Silent to me. Told the wife through hand gesture to remain silent so as not to scare my little one. Next day at about the same time I was driving west on South River rd in Harpersfield, on my way to deliver a full 30 lb propane tank to my work for the tow motor. I look up in the north west sky and see another red orange lantern and this time it was coming at me. Me! I was already worked up prior to seeing it for some reason. I was acting like a primitive person, ..ready to fight. Its light intensity increased as it came towards me. It glided so smooth and silent. Then it stopped, backed away and dimmed down and I drove away ready to fight. I know what I saw. I observe nature and understand all sciences. The numbers say UFOs exist, never saw one or became aware of one until this day."],"Latitude":"41.771163","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-81.049819","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Madison","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Region":"Ohio","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-08052012-0015","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path then hovering","Date Submitted":"08/05/2012 10:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41451.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41451.html"]}
