{"Summary":"no sound for large size, about 3 times larger than helicopter, straightline path with little swaying and round yellowish light near rear and reflective orange color from orange street lights and flat bottom with kind of triangular shape.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","divs":["Sighting Detailsi was observing with naked eye for planets. night sky was clear with little overcast. having a cigarette on front steps by myself. no street noise of any kind like police or fire trucks. it was very quiet can actually hear cars a couple of blocks away. can hear the train a mile away. heard a jet minutes before sighting. then i couldnt hear a train anymore. i was standing outside kind of struck by the silence of the city. so i started looking for a planet and its position. it was in the south direction on the right lower side of the moon. looked for a few seconds and decided i didnt want to stare it was a little straining to look at from my position. so as i was gonna sit down and fininsh my smoke and think about the silence then something caught my eye...at first i thought i was gonona see a bird. no sound for the first 2 or 3 seconds and then i was adjusting my depth perception thinking it was too far to hear. then it was really high and then i noticed a round yellow orangish light near the rear of it. i thought what is that. next 4 to 5 seconds i was judging its direction and how it was flying. it was going straight and i know a bird dosent fly that way. so i adjusted my depth perception again. it was going straight and i judged it to be like a 1000 ft in the air and it was huge...3 times the size of a helicopter...so i was concentrating real hard to hear it ... and i couldnt hear anything. so it was like a mile away and for sure over 1000 ft away...my perception started adjusting and then i can see that the moon was like 50 to 60 degrees at the time. so it was flying straight and then it swayed...with me facing directly west and it being directly over the city, i noticed it swayed a little and then straighten back to the path it seemed to be following. i concentrated really hard to see any body movement in case it was a bird. but no birds has light on it...but i still tried to see if there was any body movement, and still nothing. it was a solid object...like it was floating. and it swayed and then went right back to the path it seemed to be on. the direction it was heading was south. to me it went right over the airport. so for the next 10 seconds or so i was trying to hear it and look for body movement. nothing...no noise or body movement. while i was observing i was looking at the bottom of the object and it seemed to a triangular shape...the top half was hard to see...but the bottom surface seemed smooth like...and to me it seemed to be reflecting the orange light i was seeeing from the street lights which were orange. this yellow light was in the middle near the rear. no other lights and no body movements. it was moving 3 times as fast as a helicopter...it sped up a little then back to its other speed. i got off the steps and walked toward the street to see it as long as i could before i lost sight of it over the house. and then rushed back to the steps and peered between the houses. it disappeared on the right side of the moon's position. it travelled in a perfect straight path with a one more sway off the path and then back again. but very little sway. the most amazing fact of this was the size, the light near the rear, no noise at all, the speed, and the straightness of its path of travel. as i watched i wondered alot about the reflection it seemed to be giving. like the bottom was not perfectly flat but its surface was and it was smooth. but the bottom seemed to be like wings where the far side was bent down reflecting light toward me and the closer side was a little bent. i can see light at the bottom because of reflection of light but i couldnt make out the top of it...the light was near the rear and in the middle. there was no fire contrail or any sort of contrail. if it hadnt caught the corner of my eye i would not have seen it at all. it was gone like in 10 to 15 seconds. as i watched and after a couple of seconds went by i had a sudden feeling like i would never ever see anything like this again. but its vivid in my memory and i wont forget it. it was so strange to see something like it and my best conclusion is that it was object i could not identify. no noise...i cant believe how quiet it was considering how high and fast it was moving....for me an object that size had to be using a loud engine to stay afloat and move that fast...but i couldnt hear anyhthing."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF =
