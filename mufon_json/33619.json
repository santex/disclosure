It appeared to hang in the sky but then after he watched it for several minutes, it moved north a small amount. He thought it might be a banner towed by a small plane, but he could not see a plane. An unusually large jet liner passed by soon after also going north from south. It was a remarkably large airplane. It had a normal looking tail and wing assembly, but the body of the plane looked to be twice as long as normal. My husband is a private investigator and security manager and is used to collecting information and making observations. He came home after seeing this object and told me about it. We got in the car and looked for it, but did not see it."]}
