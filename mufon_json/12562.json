I got off the bus started to walk home and for some reason something was telling me to look up. As look up I notice something was hovering, in mid air, but I didn���t pay any mind to it. At first I thought it was plane, but it suddenly hit me that this object was hovering in mid air in a 45 degree angle in open area. I knew that it wasn���t an air plane because planes can���t hover in mid air and I knew it wasn���t a helicopter because the object was too big for it to be a helicopter. Like I said, the object was hovering in a 45 degree angle for a minute or two and then it slowly started to straighten itself out. Once it straightens itself out it began to proceed forward in a slow moving pace. I was actually blown away because I never expected to see something like this in my life. Anyway, the object continued moving forward until it was gone."],"Latitude":"40.768681","Summary":"A strange object was hovering in mid air.","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.768681,+-74.018858(12562)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12562) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/19/2008 09:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Longitude":"-74.018858","Region":"New Jersey","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12562.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12562.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown","City":"Weehawken","Date of the Event":"05/19/2008 09:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-09172008-0057"}
