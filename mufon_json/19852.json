{"Case Number":"19852","Object Shape":"Boomerang","divs":["Sighting Details I live in North Naples Fl. very near Wiggins Pass on the southwest coast. On the early morning of September 20th,2009 at approximatly 1:30am my husband and I was taking a late night swim in our pool. The night was clear and we had been watching stars. I noticed a glowing v shape light moving south along the coast It surprised me so I told my husband to look. The light was a glow and in the shape of a boomerang or wide v shape nothing was flashing or changing, just a steady glow. We watched and followed it as far as we could see. There was no noise with it and it moved faster then any small plane. My husband and I are both pilots so we often watch plane traffic. When I first saw it I thought it could be a light reflecting from traffic but when we followed it we realized it had the v shape form. It caught us off guard but we were able to watch it for about 10 seconds until obstacles got in the way. WOW!"],"Summary":"Sighted a glowing boomerang shape moving silently along the coast.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.145496,+-81.78976(19852)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19852) map </A>","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Naples","There were no other sightings in Naples on or around September 20th 2009"],"Date Submitted":"10/07/2009 09:43 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Log Number":"US-10072009-0012","City":"Naples","Longitude":"-81.78976","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19852.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19852.html"],"Date of the Event":"09/20/2009 01:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Florida","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"26.145496","Country":"United States"}
