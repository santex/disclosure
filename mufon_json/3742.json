Bright blue skies, no clouds. 2 passenger jets very clear in the sky flying my right to left. One was flying much higher than the other and the higher one was further to the left than the other. Suddenly I noticed an oval object which was shiny (someone had described a similarity to a mylar balloon that is well suited to this ) While I could see the wings and tail of the jet planes, even the one that was a good distance away, this object had no protrusions. It traveled relatively slowly so that I was able to keep an eye on it while I drove. I then realized it had changed direction and was traveling left to right and I eventually lost sight of it. Haven't a clue as to what it was but it seemed to have a very matter of fact appearance as if it belonged there. It was definitely a physical object that was mobile on its own."],"Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"06/01/2005 10:00 UTC","Country":"United States"}
