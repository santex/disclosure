The sky was perfectly clear except for some clouds very low on the horizon. I saw out of the corner of my eye what I first assumed was a helicopter hovering in place. I looked up and noticed immediately that I was mistaken, as this craft had no wings, blades, or anything. It was simply a smooth, metallic silver pill-shaped object. I only got to look at it for a couple of seconds before (I assume) the car in front of me noticed it, too, and hit their brakes suddenly. I looked away for only a second to gain control of my car and looked back less than two seconds later to see that the object had disappeared without a trace."],"Longitude":"-81.919553","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/17/2010 10:53 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24590.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24590.html"],"Latitude":"41.416812","Object Shape":"Cigar","Summary":"Pill-Shaped UFO over 90W (Cleveland, OH).","Region":"Ohio","Case Number":"24590","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in North Olmsted","There were no other sightings in North Olmsted on or around July 1st 2010"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
