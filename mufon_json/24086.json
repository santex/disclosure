Since the water looks more beautiful when viewed through my polarized sunglasses I decided to take two pictures. One through the lense of my sunglasses and one without. In the picture I took through the sunglasses you can see the blip in the background. The pictures were taken seconds apart. I didn't notice the blip until I reviewed the pictures on my computer when I got home."],"Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Windy","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Boynton Beach","Latitude":"26.533299","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"07/01/2010 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Blimp","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-80.063991","Log Number":"US-07022010-0008","Summary":"Didn't see it until I reviewed pictures.","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24086.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24086_submitter_file1__0701001332a.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24086_submitter_file2__0701001332.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24086.html"]}
