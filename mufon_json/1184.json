(...) for 18 months i had been feeding 3 bigfoots. ihad jon beckjord fly in from washington and stay for 8 days to gatherinformation about the bigfoots that had converged on our secluded neighborhood.james mosley of new jersey had been staying with me to gather info for a storyin his magazine \"saucer smear\". he had left the day before to visit friends upnorth and would return on saturday, before returning to new jersey on sunday.this craft landing was on a friday night and jim was very upset that he wasnthere to witness it. i am giving you a map i drew of this area. we had an areavoid of all sounds. the area was in the shape of a triangle. this no soundlasted for the full 18 months. the night of the craft landind the night soundsreturned for 2 weeks and were so beautiful. they then disappeared and thefootprints and noises were definitely different. i now believe that thelegendary bigfoot comes from the crafts and that the earth is an r & r for them.i believe that my semi-friendly bigfoots were taken aboard the craft that landedthat night and thats the reason i was numb from the waist down. i believe theycan read the mind and they knew i would go to investigate their landing and thisis why they numbed me. i believe i would have witnessed the transportation ofthe big foot. if this had happened they wouldnt have had any choice but to takeme and whoever was with me. i know that when the sounds disappeared, the printswere 3 different kinds aand the bellering was different. i believe the reason wehad the night sounds back was because when they dropped a different group ofbeings off, they headed into the dense woods on the other side of the creek andit took them 2 weeks to come back into our area. during my 18 months ofinvestigating, i have taken dozens of pictures and have 2 photos that arebelieved to be the big foot. ...believe it or not! -- betty powell"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.944784,+-83.268804(1184)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (1184) map </A>","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in West Jefferson","There were no other sightings in West Jefferson on or around July 17th 1981"],"Date Submitted":"07/17/1981 02:00 UTC","Longitude":"-83.268804","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
