{"divs":["Sighting Details Me and my girl friend were out side in my back yard looking at the stars at about 1 in the morning. It was a cloudless nite. In the middle of the sky suddenly appeared what looked like the britest star i had ever seen. After about 2 seconds it lost most of its light and started moving north at the speed of a satelite. After about 8 more seconds it just faded away.Not out of my site range but disaapeared. As it suddenly appeared I had a strong feeling it was a non terrestrial vehical and was under intelligent control as it appeared stationary then started moving."],"Log Number":"US-05022008-0004","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Case Number":"10635","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-122.304582","Date of the Event":"05/01/2008 12:00 UTC","Summary":"Brite yellow light suddenly appears in middle of sky fades away in 6 seconds","Latitude":"47.94454","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10635.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10635.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10635.html"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Washington","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mukilteo","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Mukilteo","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.94454,+-122.304582(10635)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10635) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
