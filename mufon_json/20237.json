We both grabbed cameras I took approx 50 photos, the object would be a bright glow over the mountain would fade out and reappear seemed to move unlike a normal aircraft. This is the fourth time we have witnessed this object, I have a good night photo and several shots from yesterday as well as a video of this object flying silently over our home. We are both professionals with pilot training and stand to loose our credibility, would like for someone to analyze our pictures and video to explain this object if possible!"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20237.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20237_submitter_file1__IMG_6516.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20237_submitter_file2__IMG_6521.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20237_submitter_file3__IMG_6303.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20237.html"],"Case Number":"20237","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.748238,+-112.007969(20237)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20237) map </A>","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Cottonwood","There were no other sightings in Cottonwood on or around October 1st 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Summary":"Bright glowing object.","Date of the Event":"10/01/2009 05:22 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"11/01/2009 12:45 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Cone, Circle, Cylinder, Fireball, Flash"}
