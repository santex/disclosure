My appartment that time was in cancun downtown and the view of this clouds from the balcony was not so spectacular, so to get better photos i went to the middle of the avenue infront. There i stood for about 5 minutes and took 19 shots with my Sony digital camera DSC-P71 3.2Mpx. Some minutes later, at home, i downloaded the photos to my computer a try to choose one to use as a screensaver. In two of the photos (No. 15 and 16) i saw something unusual. When i zoomed the image No.16 i saw of what it appeared to be a metallic sphere, still today i don���t know what this can be, in photo 17 taken some seconds later the object is gone. And in photo 15 (top right) there is a small dark object moving, don���t know if it���s the same sphere. I hope that somebody can help me determine what is there in the photos."],"Longitude":"-86.844937","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Cancun","There were no other sightings in Cancun on or around September 12th 2003","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"16319","Latitude":"21.164924","City":"Cancun","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16319.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16319_submitter_file1__DSC00015.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16319_submitter_file2__DSC00016.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16319_submitter_file3__DSC00017.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16319.html"],"Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"Mexico","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"09/12/2003 12:00 UTC"}
