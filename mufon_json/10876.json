I watched these objects spin in small circles, they were ���floating��� and every time they would turn I would see a quick flash of red and then white, super bright. I could not estimate the distance. After a few minutes they floated straight up and stretched out into a straight line ( from north to south) 2 red now appearing to be bright stars facing south , and 2 white facing north disappearing westward. My best description of these objects is parachuters, but this doesn���t seem probable since they were not decending. I have 10 years Navy experience, and have seen many aircraft, but nothing like this."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/17/2008 11:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-05222008-0009","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10876.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10876.html"],"Latitude":"39.06644","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-108.542879","City":"Grand Junction","Case Number":"10876"}
