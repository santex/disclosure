As we were aproaching our home I looked up into the sky to see how many stars were out when i noticed a dark triangle object fly across the sky. I only saw it because of the street lights reflecting off the bottom of it. This object had no lights and no sound with it. I just got a new telescope so I have been looking at the stars a lot lately. Luckily I have seen more than stars. This is the second sighting for me here in Tulsa, OK. Last year about this time I was driving and saw a bright light in the sky it stayed in the sky above my car for a few minutes and then took off at an impossible speed and vanished into a tiny dot. It was like watching star trek do warp speed. I never thought I would get to see another one. My son was really excited he looked out the window for a while afterwards. It was definately a thrilling experience. The object would have been to dark for a picture or video to capture I think."],"Summary":"dark triangle object flew across sky","Longitude":"-97.089037","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"02/07/2008 08:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Case Number":"9488","Log Number":"US-02072008-0017","Weather Factors":"None","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Region":"Oklahoma","trends":[],"Latitude":"35.013842","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/9488.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/9488.html"],"City":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"02/07/2008 08:30 UTC"}
