{"Log Number":"US-07232011-0012","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt approximately 7:50 p.m., my son and I were in our backyard when he happened to look up into the sky and noticed a very bright and shiny long white object flying in the blue sky. It was a good sized object (depending on distance) as related to an airplane that was also in the sky flying near the object. We used my phone to capture still images as well a video (attached)that shows the plane in the frame (the plane shows black against the blue sky). The object was traveling at a much slower speed than the plane. When zooming in on the still image (attached), the shape looks saucer like and has an orange glow in the center. There were no blinking lights."],"Object Features":"Dome, Other","Date of the Event":"07/23/2011 07:50 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30318.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30318_submitter_file2__ufo1.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/30318_submitter_file3__IMG_0334.PNG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30318.html"],"Region":"Nevada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.200049,+-115.113701(30318)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (30318) map </A>","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Extremely bright & shiny orangish-white cigar/saucer shaped object flying through blue sky","trends":["There have been 18 other sightings in North Las Vegas","There were no other sightings in North Las Vegas on or around July 23rd 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"North Las Vegas","Date Submitted":"07/29/2011 12:34 UTC","Latitude":"36.200049","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"30318","Longitude":"-115.113701","Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile"}
