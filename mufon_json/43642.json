As I turned onto 1st Ave. it looked like the object was following us for a few seconds. It was then that my passangers were able to see the bottom of it as it flew over us. The lights were diamond shaped. I was driving really slow as not to loose sight of it but within seconds it made a turn and headed towards the East in such high speed that once we looked it was near the Humboldt Park area where I had called a family member with excitement and when they went outside they were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of it too! It was so exciting. This is my second sighting of a UFO within a month. It's been amazing."]}
