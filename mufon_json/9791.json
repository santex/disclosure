There were trees in front of it so I decided to get away from the trees to see it better.I took my eyes off it and when I looked again, it was gone.It was like nothing I had ever seen and had no idea what it was.I never felt afraid ( I should have). I called the Hamlet N.C. police and reported it and they didn't know anything but said another woman had reported it."],"Date Submitted":"12/17/1979 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-03012008-0002","Summary":"It looked like a giagantic planet"}
