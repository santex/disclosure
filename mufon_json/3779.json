I was sitting in the seat looking aout the sun roof at the moon. I noticed that the moon was out early and it was full. When I fist saw it I thought that maybe it was some sort of rocket. It was heading right toward the moon. I went from left to right in the sky. It moved very slow at first and I was wondering if it was possable to see a rocket or ship heading towards the moon with the naked eye. It got faster as it passed by the moon in the sky. I realized it was not a rocket or a ship of any kind. It stopped as it got passed the moon and stood still. I was still tring to figure out what it was. It stayed on one spot for a good 2-3 mins and the it shot off at a high rate of speed to the right."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.199677,+-85.3802(3779)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3779) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3779.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3779.html"],"trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Muncie","There was one other sighting in Muncie on or around August 13th 2005"],"Object Shape":"Cigar","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Region":"Indiana","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/13/2005 06:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Case Number":"3779","Summary":"bright white cigar shaped","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08282005-0002","City":"Muncie"}
