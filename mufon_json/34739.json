I leaned forward to realize this small object in the sky that was traveling south at a high rate of speed. It was silver looking with the rising sun reflecting off of it. I watched it travel for about 6 seconds and it simply disappeared, seemingly just as I realized I was viewing something that wasnt a plane."]}
