{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Country":"United States","Region":"California","divs":["sighting detailsat stated date\\time, i was standing on my balcony which faces north, directly under the lax final approach. at my location, lax sits at about 8-10 miles west. i often look at the passing aircraft and as i did, i saw an uta (unknown type aircraft)\\ufo doing counter clockwise orbits roughly @ 20-30,000 feet over arcadia\\pasadena\\sierra madre region of l.a. county (north northeast of downey, ca). the initiation of the orbit began with an inbound approach from the west, at roughly 2005 hrs pdt. what caught my attention to this was the brightness of the craft and the relative speed for the altitude, which was fast and at that altitude, the craft had to be clear of any issues with lax approach. i eyeballed the craft until it was about 8-10 miles out. the craft then entered into a sharp left bank, leveled out, then another sharp left bank at what appeared to be about 5 miles into its first leg. an attempt to capture the event on video proved fruitless. on review, the image was black (too distant). the uta\\ufo was very brightly lit and it appeared to have a strobe on the port side, indicating to me that it was an aircraft rather than ufo per se. update 2300 pdt: i just went out to see if the object was still doing orbits. it is and further, i heard a very faint roar. i believe this is possibly military, maybe a cap (combat air patrol) over metro la. as the object turned nnw\\w, i lost sight of it, then regained it as it came back sse\\e to resume its orbits. the object is still on station at this time, 2304 pdt."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-118.126969","Case Number":"17656","City":"Downey","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17656.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17656.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-06252009-0003","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Latitude":"33.947044","Date Submitted":"06/24/2009 10:40 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.947044,+-118.126969(17656)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17656) map </A>","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Downey","There were no other sightings in Downey on or around June 24th 2009"],"Summary":"Unknown type aircraft orbiting.","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"06/24/2009 10:40 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
