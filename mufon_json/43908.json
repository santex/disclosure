Didnt think anything of it. A hour n half later n north 60 miles apprx saw to the north in the distance a blue n white light that wasnt blinking the color n brightness n glow of it caught me off guard. First thought was it looked like a giant ball of diamonds with a bright light vehind it lighting it up. It seemed to go fast in the distance across the sky slower then a falling star but faster then anything ive seen in military. It seemed to slow to a hover on the wesr side of the interstate for a few seconds n then it got brighter n disapeared so fast that i think it took off heading west north west before it disappeared second later. Ruled out reflections n bugs airplanes and anything else i can think of. No military bases close to here. When image got to be brighter before taking off the radio crackled a lot in a area that it hardly ever does. No storms or powerlines in the area."],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Thornton","There were 2 other sightings in Thornton on or around November 13th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"11/13/2012 09:00 UTC","Longitude":"-93.377009","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11142012-0010","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"43908","Date Submitted":"11/14/2012 03:50 UTC","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Sphere","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.950653,+-93.377009(43908)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43908) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
