The object quickly changed directions, and in a zig zag pattern, I knew that it could not be a shooting star. I observed the object follow this pattern going to the east near the Big Dipper constellation. I watched it approx for 40 seconds, and thank goodness it was long enough for me to point it out, and my friend was able to observe the same object in the sky. There is also no way this could have been a satellite as they move slowly and in a straight line. No way was this a plane. It moved way to fast and a plane does not move in this manner. I also know my eyes were not playing tricks on me as I have watched the skies for many years, and not once have I ever seen anything like this ever!!!!"],"Source":"MUFON","Summary":"UFO SIGHTING"}
