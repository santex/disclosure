And i saw a falling star about 12:05 am and then 5 mins latter i saw the 3 objects in a triangle formation at a very high altitude.The sighting lasted about 20 to 25 sec..Just thought i would report this sighting in case anyone else in the area seen the same thing. It just could have been satellite,s its just that i never have seen them in a perfect formation like that.
