The object had a strobe type effect which caused the object to appear to jump or skip from spot to spot. I observed the object for several minutes and just drove home. My reason for writing was Cliff's description of his event in episode three of the series. I know we are in a direct line with Dover Air Force Base and several of the Military bases in MD. My guess was that it was simply some type of experimental craft that was being tested. Please feel free to call if you have any questions. Please be fore warned that I have a voice problem that causes some problems with volume on the phone. Thanks for listening. I would have never contacted anyone if I hadn't seen the program.
