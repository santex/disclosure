Also when I took a bath that night my whole body stung when I got in the hot water and for a couple weeks after and when I put my hands in cold water it literely felt like my skin was peeling off and my skin would welt up where the water hit it like acid or something and last of all my hair started turning gray more like white at 38yrs old never had it before I have new white hair growth out the side of my head that was facing object its now 5 inches long mixed in with my real hair very strange.I dont understand what happened but without a doubt something did and now im afraid they are goung to come back someday to take back what ever they put in me.I want to go be hypnotized but maybe not rembering everything is my bodies way of dealing with the trauma.I wish I had someone to talk to I feel alone."],"Region":"Washington"}
