I did not even see the object until I downloaded the pictures onto my computer. The bottom looks like it is glowing white with a little green and the top looks blue. It only showed up in this one picture. I thought this is cool, I got something pretty neat here. I emailed the picture to a few friends to get opinions. Everyone says it looks like a UFO."],"Object Shape":"Cigar","Summary":"Did not see this object when taking pictures","Tags":"City","Country":"United States"}
