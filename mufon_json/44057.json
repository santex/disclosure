{"Region":"Michigan","City":"Grosse Pointe Woods","Case Number":"44057","Disposition":"Unresolved","divs":["Sighting DetailsWent outside to sit on my porch. It was very cloudy out and the orb was the only thing in the sky and very bright. I first listened to hear if there were any sounds in case it was a aircraft , but there were no sounds at all . The orb was very bright and apparent changing from red to orange in color , not blinking but more of a pulsating change. It swayed very slightly and was ascending straight up. It was not moving very fast and as it was moving up it was getting slightly dimmer. Then went up further got smaller and then disappeared.I just kept thinking what was that , and that it was not any type of aircraft. i lost sight of the object because it just disappeared."],"Object Features":"None","Longitude":"-82.90563","Latitude":"42.451778","Log Number":"US-11202012-0012","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Grosse Pointe Woods","There were no other sightings in Grosse Pointe Woods on or around November 19th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44057.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44057.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.451778,+-82.90563(44057)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44057) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"11/19/2012 09:23 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Red orange glowing orb ascending , very bright then started to dim then disappeared","Date Submitted":"11/20/2012 10:10 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
