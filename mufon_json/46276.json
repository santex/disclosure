I looked down the street towards the main road which is south from the house. I noticed 3 red-orange lights without blinking just flying towards the north, then 3 more appeared right behind the first three, then finally as the first six flew by about 30 miles (approx) 4 or 5 more lights appeared behind those. I first thought that they were planes, but noticed that lights were not blinging, to see like 10 lights in the sky just flying is strange, never seen that before."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46276.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46276.html"],"Summary":"10 flying objects coming from the SE","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"California","Case Number":"46276","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"37.060189","City":"Los Banos","Longitude":"-120.842755","Log Number":"US-03182013-0013","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Los Banos","There were no other sightings in Los Banos on or around March 17th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.060189,+-120.842755(46276)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46276) map </A>","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"03/17/2013 08:35 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown"}
