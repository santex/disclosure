I looked up to the sky and it got my attention. I thought it was an airplain , but it was not moving and had no wings. my 2nd sighting was a few yrs. later. I was about 22 and it happened at about 3am. I saw some lights at the airport that did not look right. watched for several mins. I tried to use tolyprathe to make it come to me. when it started to move I got scared and moved to my apt. did not hear any sounds but I could see lights and the shape of it as it got closer. I beleave it had windows in front, with some kind of figure in the windows. as I unlocked my door and open it a fast moving opject flow out and I could feel it. It was ghostly gray and like a fog. I looked up and saw no stars and could feel something strange then it was gone and the stars reappered. I can draw them both if needed."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49377.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49377.html"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-08022013-0004","Date Submitted":"08/02/2013 02:01 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.209868,+-121.171039(49377)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (49377) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Case Number":"49377"}
