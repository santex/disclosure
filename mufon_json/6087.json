I stood there and observed them for about a half hour. While I watched these lights I saw one among the trees moving south \"I was looking to the east.\" I keep looking around and right above me there was a large dark object with four lights in the shape of a diamond, the lights were faint, but noticable. The lights were slowly moving north at a steady pace. The clouds were starting to move in about this time. Most of the lights by now were covered by the clouds. I could only see the one light in the tree line, it started pulsing a clear light then the light pattern instantly changed to a multi color strobing pattern. The light moved fairly quickly upward into the clouds and disappeared. That was the last that I saw of the lights."],"Object Shape":"Flash, Star-like","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Monroe","There were no other sightings in Monroe on or around January 4th 2007"],"Date Submitted":"01/04/2007 08:30 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Date of the Event":"01/04/2007 08:30 UTC","Log Number":"US-01042007-0011","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Summary":"Moving Lights in the sky, looked like really bright flashing stars","City":"Monroe"}
