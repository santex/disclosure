I made my daughter turn around so she could see it. We both watched as it hovered, pulsed, dropped down a bit, rise up a bit, morph into diamond, then star like then triangle like and slowly traveled towards the SW. It was still in the Gerton area or maybe Bat Cave but it just disappeared. We could still see the sky where it should have been but it was gone and at that point we witnessed a plane traveling fast from the SE as if it were trying to catch it. At one point we had both visible and it was very obvious that the plane was dwarfed by the UFO. It was huge."],"City":"Gerton","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"50718","Summary":"huge orange glowing cross hovering in SE of Gerton, NC and disappeared in SW, plane went after it","Date of the Event":"09/08/2013 08:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/09/2013 09:25 UTC","Region":"North Carolina","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50718.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50718.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","Longitude":"-82.357894","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Gerton","There were no other sightings in Gerton on or around September 8th 2013"],"Log Number":"US-09092013-0022"}
