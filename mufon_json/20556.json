We noticed three points of light in a loose triangle formation moving across the sky. The objects moved from one side of the sky to the other in just a few seconds. An airplane was taking of from the Portland International Jetport at the same time. The 3 points of light appeared to be at a much higher altitude than the jet. The triangle formation that the k=lights held seemed to be much much larger than a jet. I was very weird."],"Date of the Event":"11/16/2009 09:45 UTC","Longitude":"-70.240881","Disposition":"IFO","City":"South Portland","Region":"Maine","Case Number":"20556","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20556.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20556.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11172009-0003","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in South Portland","There were no other sightings in South Portland on or around November 16th 2009"],"Tags":"City"}
