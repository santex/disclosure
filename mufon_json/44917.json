I was a passenger in the front. On the way home from shopping. A red beaming light with halo like affect caught my eye. What struck me was that it made not one sound. I had gotten out of the car afterwards and observed it disappearing into the east behind the clouds. Note: It had been snowing the last few days. Activity outside was busy as it was only 8:00 at night. There is Hopkins over to the west and North of me but it was no plane. Have Life flights also to our West and North East but the fact it made no sound for something so bright and obvious told me that it was no conventional craft. Flare? Not the way it moved so Unknown to me at this time."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44917.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44917.html"],"Latitude":"41.400024","Summary":"light went overhead towards North, travelled from west to east.
