At about 7:51pm I briefly turned around to grab my suitcase and glanced up noticing an extremly large Bommerang shaped aerocraft that appeared to have just entered the atmosphere. It had 5 lights (all of which where a bright grey in color) and appeared to be at least a mile in length when comparing the Cessna's and 737 flying in the area. After I saw it I watched it until it entered cloud cover and from its vector appeared to be heading SW of my position at ERAU."],"Object Features":"Wings, Other","Longitude":"-81.018193","Sighting Duration":"07:51:00","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"29.216215","Object Shape":"Boomerang, Triangle","trends":["There have been 13 other sightings in Daytona Beach","There were no other sightings in Daytona Beach on or around October 10th 2008"],"Case Number":"12999","Log Number":"US-10102008-0008","Date Submitted":"10/10/2008 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Summary":"Flew over Daytona Beach airport as if entering atmosphere, then proceeded into cloud cover.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12999.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12999.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/10/2008 12:00 UTC"}
