{"Object Features":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Denver","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was walking N. up Monaco Parkway toward Hampden, about 2 blocks S. of Hampden ave. When I saw what I thought at first was a zeppelin, when I noticed how smoothly, and high it was flying. When it reflected the sun it was a brilliant silver. It was in a flight pattern going from East to West, being just North of myself in the sky. It flew VERY slowly, and I see planes flying out of DIA all day long so I just watched it to see if there was an undercarriage, wings, whatever that would conclude it was a craft that I could explain. It continued in a westerly direction. after about 3-4 minutes of flying very slowly in that direction, it abrubtly, yet smoothly turned southerly at which time it sped up expenentially then disappearing all together into the blue sky. This has been about the 7th UFO Ive seen over 20 years, first Ive reported. It doesnt even shock me anymore."],"Log Number":"US-06262011-0013","Disposition":"IFO","Summary":"A long silver cylinder","Date of the Event":"06/25/2011 03:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.745664,+-104.981993(29736)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29736) map </A>","Latitude":"39.745664","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29736.html"],"Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-104.981993","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"29736","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There was one other sighting in Denver on or around June 25th 2011"],"Region":"Colorado","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Cylinder","Date Submitted":"06/26/2011 03:15 UTC"}
