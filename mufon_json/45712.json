There was an airplane flying as well in the same area and these lights looked nothing like it. They were far too high in the sky to be helicopters. The event lasted for several minutes in which the three lights disappeared one after the other without about a minute or two in between each disappearance. They looked like red stars, that's the only way I can explain it. They were just hovering in the sky and then I watched them disappear. I saw people outside their houses looking up at the sky after this happened."],"Log Number":"US-02152013-0006","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/14/2013 08:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like"}
