{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOn Saturday night of Saturday July 3, 2010 starting at about 9:20 P.M. CST several of us observed orange glowing balls moving in formations of two and three. As the first group disappeared, another group would follow in about five minutes. They appeared to be following the Lake Michigan shoreline from south to north and then gaining altitude and turning out over the Lake to the northeast. There must have been twelve in all. While they appeared to be about a mile east of our position and about 2,000 feet up, we did not hear engine noise. They appeared to be floating until one gained on the other's position in the first group."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-07042010-0003","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24120.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24120.html"],"Latitude":"43.750828","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Slow moving orange balls over the Lake Michigan shoreline at Sheboygan, WI.","City":"Sheboygan","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"07/03/2010 09:20 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Longitude":"-87.71453","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"Wisconsin","Weather Factors":"None","Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/04/2010 12:35 UTC","Case Number":"24120","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Sheboygan","There were no other sightings in Sheboygan on or around July 3rd 2010"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.750828,+-87.71453(24120)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24120) map </A>","Tags":"City","Object Features":"None"}
