{"divs":["Sighting DetailsLooking South out my window around 10:20 PM. A golf ball sized glowing red-orange ball of light flew almost directly overhead from North to South. There was a jet taking off from SeaTac and I could make an easy comparison to it...This object had no blinking lights, but seamed to slowly pulsate. It moved very slow across the sky about a third of the speed of the jet, until fading out in the southern sky. I have seen many types of aircraft from SeaTac and Boeing Airfields and different helicopters including news, police and Harborview's medic copter, but this was unlike anything I have ever seen in the air. The only possible thing I could think of was it could have been a Japanese lantern, but I have never seen one of those in person either, so I can't say for sure. It was just strange. Also, I have been seeing a lot of strange lights over the Seattle area since about February."],"Date Submitted":"08/12/2012 10:34 UTC","Summary":"Glowing orange-red ball of light moving slowly north to south then disappears","Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"08/11/2012 10:20 UTC","Latitude":"47.627863","Country":"United States","City":"Seattle","Longitude":"-122.321426","Object Features":"None","Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere","trends":["There have been 110 other sightings in Seattle","There was one other sighting in Seattle on or around August 11th 2012"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41667.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41667.html"],"Case Number":"41667","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Log Number":"US-08122012-0011","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.627863,+-122.321426(41667)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41667) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Washington","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
