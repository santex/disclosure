{"divs":["sighting detailsit was 3.51am i was decorating my living room. i have a different sleep pattern to most. i sleep during the day & i am awake through the night so this is normal for me to be awake at this time. for a couple of months i had become aware of helicopter activity, usually between 2 - 5 am. i didn't think anything of this,i pressumed that it was a police helicopter following car thiefs etc... my home is near to a rough estate. on a couple of occasions i tryed to watch the helecopter, i did'nt seem to be able to see any outline only the lights were visable & as soon as i tryed to take a picture it would always head away from my house every time. i was very loud & somtimes sounded broken, it would be hovering near to my house for a couple of hours sometimes, then as soon as i grabbed my phone to go out side it would leave & often return as soon as i came inside or left my phone inside. on one occasion the helicopter went silent i did video this with my camera phone this was also on its retreat, my partner told me that helicopters are capible of doing this. at times i would notice that the helicopter was getting closer & closer to my house, to the point that i would run & lock my back door in case there was a criminal heading towords my garden. on this particular evening i turned all my downstairs lights out & went in to my living room window & opened the left window & amimed my camera phone at the helicopter\\lights, i had it in my view & then zoomed in. what i saw on my phone was a shock, i became so afraid almost to scared to take the photo. i saw a dark disk & i think there was some sort of windows at the front near the middle the top was wavey with red & green lights in the dips in the form of red, green, red, green pattern. i tried to take the photo, my whole body was shaking, my hand trembled so much, well you can see from the photo. i've often wondered why photo's that people take of ufo are never clear, now i knew why. as i took the photo there was a large obvious flash which i wasn't expecting. i panicked & felt that i had been seen. i ran to my hall turned the hall & toilet lights off so my house blended with the other houses with no lights on in my street. i turned my phone off & removed the battery. i got into bed with my partner whom was asleep. the object circle a couple of times then left. i was scared but i must have falled asleep quite quickly which suprised me. the next day i looked at the photo & showed my partner, he does not believe in ufos & did not want to discuss this with me. however the memory faded & with time & i convinced my-self that i did not see what i thought i saw that night. i tryed to think of other possible explanations & put the photo down to the fact that i may have caught the street lights. i recently looked at this photo again & having learn't how to lighten pictures on doing so i realised that this was an object in the air & not street lights. several month's later (september) i accidently photographed other possible ufos whilst i was taking photo's of hot air ballons & sunsets. this year my whole family had a sighting of two dark grey discs that flew right over our heads. we all drew drawings of what we saw. i was not scared this time & enjoyed watching them for several minutes. kind regards claire"],"City":"London","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.517659,+-0.126835(20274)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20274) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"51.517659","Log Number":"GB-11022009-0014","trends":["There have been 91 other sightings in London","There were no other sightings in London on or around May 25th 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United Kingdom","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-0.126835","Case Number":"20274","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"disc with 12 maybe more green & red lights on top","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20274.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/20274_submitter_file1__richsphone091.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20274.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"11/02/2009 08:15 UTC","Region":"England","Date of the Event":"05/25/2008 03:51 UTC"}
