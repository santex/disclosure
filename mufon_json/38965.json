{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at work & stepped out to take a smoke break. I've been interested in planet location so I looked directly up to locate Mars & Saturn when I immediately noticed a very bright light. I'm familiar a bit with the position of bright stars & this one wasn't right. I was alone but still out loud I said \"what in the world is that\"? I focused on a nearby star to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me, to verify that the \"object\" was moving. I could see that it was moving just like a satellite would in orbit but it was far brighter. I watched it until it went out of view due to a neighboring single story building. I've seen satellites move & I've never seen one stay as bright for so long as this did. I was so curious about the object that when I left work at 11:pm I came home & went to the tracker site for the ISS to see if that's what it was but based on it's path over the east coast it didn't seem to fit. I've never seen anything unexplainable in the sky but was strange."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-06082012-0001","Region":"Tennessee","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38965.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38965.html"],"Longitude":"-84.027968","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Powell","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Latitude":"36.031747","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.031747,+-84.027968(38965)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38965) map </A>","Case Number":"38965","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Bright Venus type light moving s.e directly overhead.
