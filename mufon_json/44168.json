I noticed all of a sudden what I thought was a shooting star so I paused, but it didn't burn out it kept going and it was moving fast, too fast to be a satellite. So I grabbed my camera and started recording I didn't think I would end up catching anything, but I provided the extracted part that is zoomed in and slowed it down. I also have the original which is about 3 minutes long, but not all of it captures the object. However the original video does have reference points such as my roof and I think trees as well before I zoom in. I would like to know what this is, because I have never seen a shape like this."],"Object Shape":"Bullet, Missile, Cigar, Cylinder, Sphere, Star-like, Teardrop","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-11262012-0016","Date of the Event":"11/26/2012 07:00 UTC","Summary":"Thought I saw a shooting start but it was lasting too long so I started recording","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44168.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44168.html"],"Longitude":"-80.42816","Case Number":"44168","Region":"Florida","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
