Around 30000 feet we noticed a hovering object to our east. It was at least 2 times our altitude, and much much larger than an aircraft. It was pulsating white then red and then a short green in a rhytic pattern. It's path never changed but it rose higher and higher in the sky until you could only see the white light. It was brighter than any other star in the sky and once the sun rose no stars could be seen but this was still there. I took a picture with my iPhone and when zoomed in it appears to have a square shape with brighter lights on top than bottom."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45149.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45149.html"],"Case Number":"45149","Object Shape":"Sphere, Square, Rectagular","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.115597,+-94.622665(45149)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45149) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/11/2013 11:29 UTC","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 27 other sightings in Kansas City","There were no other sightings in Kansas City on or around January 5th 2013"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Summary":"Flying at 30000 feet observed large target above and east of us with white, red, and green lights","City":"Kansas City","Latitude":"39.115597","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"01/05/2013 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-94.622665"}
