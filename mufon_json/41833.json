The neighborhoodwas very quite and and suddenly all the insect noise seemed to shut off. The street lights flashed then dimmed out. AT that moment we looked up an could see an object in sthe sky the shape of a boat which was darker than the sky. The object moved across the sky in a straight line from northwest towards the southeast horizon. As soon as I lost the first object in the horizon and second object appeared in the northwest region of the sky in a slightly different line but moving in the same direction towards the southeast horizon. Both objects where darker than the sky and seemed to be sligtly alluminated by the moon light. Neither obect had any kind of lights and neither made any noise. I could only describe it as watching to paper airplanes fly across the sky. Each object past across my visual field from horizon to horizon in 4 to 5 seconds."],"Date Submitted":"08/18/2012 02:18 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Two seperate dark objects passed in sky over our house.","Object Shape":"Cone, Square, Rectagular","Date of the Event":"06/10/2009 09:30 UTC","City":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"27.673627","Longitude":"-81.512814","Case Number":"41833","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
