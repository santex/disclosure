{"divs":["sighting detailsi awoke one night in a state of which i can only explain as a spasm, my body was in a state of rigid solid state, i could not move a musle, it felt like something was on top of me. i fighted to get movement back in my body. i could not turn my head, or move at all, it was like i was having a fight to get control of my body. after a few panic stricken momentts i could just barely move my finger's , only just a little bit. i then felt that there was more than just a spasm, i felt dirty and touched, it was a horrible feeling from deep inside me. then i could just about move my toes, again very very slightly, my throat felt like it was being held, i could feel something was on top of me, my hands where by my side but it felt like they was around my own throat, holding very tightly, i was using all my might to break free from this spasmodic state. then i swear i could feel something breathing into my left ear, a sound of a growl like noise right next to my ear, i struggled to move my head to the left, like breaking free from a strangle hold. i could just work out a head , a big long head next to my own face, and as the spasm like feeling started to wear off, a tiny bit at a time, i could work out that this thing on top of me was like a lizard\\newt thing, it was like blending in with all what was around it, or maybe invisable, im not very sure which, but i could see it clearly as the seconds passed on. it was reptilian, i growled at it, or i think i did, my mind and my body gave all it could to do so, i bared my teeth at it, and i could feel it could read my mind, and i was swaering at it, and shouting all sorts of vengence at it, i felt violated and used. the next thing, which was very very quick, it was off me and was standing to one side of the bottom of my bunk bed, which i had at the time, a light came through the thin gap which was made by the curtains, the light was diffrent shades of a golden light which also had very very small particles inside it, like dust or very very small stars which moved around like little bright lights. this reptilian creature stood there, i would say about 6 feet high, i could feel it was either proud or happy, maybe both, i tried to sit up as best i could and i spat at it, but the spit just went down my chin, and through my mind i swore at it again. the creature walked forward and stepped into the light beam, as it did, the feet, then the legs vanished into the light, the more the creature moved forward towards the window, the more of it vanished. it was gone, i felt relaxed then, but i could still feel where i was held around my throat, i felt i was raped by this horrendous monster. i awoke the next day, it was bright sunny day, i could hear my mother downstairs, washing up and doing housework, i then didnt move a muscle, i ran the thing through my mond again, and yes i could still feel where i was held around my throat as i lay with my hands down by my side. i know this happend, my mind and heart and soul knows that this happend, but for the life of me, i could not run downstatirs to explain to my mother about this. who would have believed it, how would my parents have handled such a thing, i did not know what to do. since that night, my step father passed away, and every once and a while, i always bring up the subject of ufo's or aliens, to see if i hear anything by someone who has experinced anything like what i did, so maybe i could hear of someone else to explain my story to. i aske dmy mother if she believed in aliens or ufo's, she repleid that my step father said once that he saw a ufo in brighton, in the sea in the 1960's, and he swore blind that it was a ufo, but only told my mother this. i never told my mother about my experince, as i thought it would be to harrowing for her to hear, as if she heard such things from two people who wouldnt never ever tell her a lie , it would be to much for her to take. what do i do about my experince, i would love to do something about it, if it helps somebody, or even do something fpor the world, as i am being very honest, and things like this should be worked on, and an answer has to be found why they are happening."],"Date of the Event":"07/25/1988 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"GB-11132009-0009","map":"<A HREF =
