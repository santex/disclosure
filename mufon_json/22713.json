Noticed very bright star-like sized object moving slow from the East to West, slightly erractic. As it was about to leave my field of vision and pass over the building, object changed direction and moved to the left (North), travelling slow. Tried to mentally communicate with object and \"ask\" it to move fast to provide \"a better show\" as I brought a co-worker over to witness. This was not my first UFO sighting and I have seen other star-like ones and more dramatic displays so I was not overly excited but believe this was not a satellite nor balloon."],"Date of the Event":"04/08/2010 03:45 UTC","Date Submitted":"04/08/2010 06:09 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Windy","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-104.975963","trends":["There have been 185 other sightings in Denver","There were no other sightings in Denver on or around April 8th 2010"],"Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22713.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22713.html"],"Region":"Colorado"}
