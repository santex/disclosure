All I could see was red and blue maybe green flashing lights. It had a bright light or tail but it was shooting high above it and below it. It appeared out of no where. I watched for about an hour until first morning sun light and it disappeared simply as it had appeared. The tail shooting above and below must have been over a mile long as it sat high up in the night sky. I have seen this once before and it was about a month ago. This is facing due East but some degrees towards the south."],"Case Number":"31311","City":"Yuba City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31311.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31311.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-08302011-0007","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"08/30/2011 08:11 UTC","Latitude":"39.138796","Object Shape":"Flash","Longitude":"-121.616867","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.138796,+-121.616867(31311)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31311) map </A>"}
