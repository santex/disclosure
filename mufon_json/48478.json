At first I would have thought it was a meteor but the almost perfect round sphere I seen before it disapeared negated that idea. Our feelings were that it was not a meteor or anything we have ever seen or heard of,amusingly enough it reminded me of when Captain Kirk would put the Enterprise in warp drive."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"48478","Object Shape":"Star-like","Date of the Event":"06/26/2013 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"06/28/2013 08:38 UTC","Summary":"a star like object traveling straight and fast became a globe or glowing sphere then disappeared"}
