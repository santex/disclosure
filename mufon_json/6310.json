co-incidence? they flew around the same area as the object for 40 minutes. next day, i telephoned local police dept's (pittsburg & antioch). they where very kind, and checked their computers, using various 'search words'. no reports of strange or unusual airborne activity, or strange lights. they did confirm the presence of the county sheriffs' helicopters. indeed there was a shooting reported, and the helicopters were responding to this. so it was a co-incidence (no 'black' helicopters this time). await witness photo from latest sighting to be attached here. i a few days earlier i closed the 01\\15\\07 pittsburg sighting reports 'as completed' - the objects classified as 'unknown'. i am now at this time reopening this case, awaiting possible further sightings. witnesses 'armed' with digital camera and binoculars. they are now keeping their video camcorder charged and on the ready. submitted by: steve reichmuth norther california mufon ssd - alameda \\ contra costa co. feb. 03, 2007"],"Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"38.030816","Case Number":"6310","Date Submitted":"02/01/2007 08:09 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-121.874861"}
