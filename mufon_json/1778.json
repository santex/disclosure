It could have been a weatherballon, or planet because I think that the sun was reflecting off of it. It waslate in the evening while the sun was setting. Due West from Bann, Germany. Idid not pay any attention at first, but I herd that an meteor fell in SouthernGerman and thought that maybe that had something to do with it, but I doubt it.The object was stationary and did not move at all. It was visible for about 5minuets then a cloud came between us and when the cloud passed it was gone. Fromthe ground I estimate the angle of observation at 15 to 20 degrees due west.Maybe someone else saw it but I think it was a satelite, weather ballon orsomething like that. All I know is that it was round, had a bright orange glow,and from where I was it was about the size of a M26M maybe a little smaller but about that size. It looked like someone hadshrunk the sun. It was not the sun because there was only like 5 clouds in thesky and they were small. I hope this helps"],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/1778.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/1778.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Sphere"}
