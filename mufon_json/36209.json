I went to my computer to check e-mail. When i turned around i saw what i thought at first were a flock of birds. I knew it was not a flock of birds because at the same time birds flew by right underneath the object. I looked closer and the object was black in the shape of a boomerang. I also noticed that the object looked like it was breaking apart but all the pieces were following. It kept a steady speed, and it did not change its shape. I watch the object for about two or three minutes until it passed over the building next to me."],"City":"Gaithersburg","Log Number":"US-03022012-0013","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-77.160653","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Black dotted boomerang shape.
