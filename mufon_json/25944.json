At first glance I thought they were those lantens that people light and they float up in the sky.but as I looked you could see they wasn't. To me they looked like 2 great big bright orange pulsing stars ,sort of twinkling (but more than twinkling)I only saw 2 but my hubby said there were 3 at first.and one just sort of faded upwards. They seemed to be quite a long way away.there was an airplane flying near to them,(thats what it looked like from where we were)The plane looked small compared to them,you could also see that the plane was obveously going along,but the 2 orange things seemed to be in one place.They looked like they were sort of hovering,but turning around to face our way.I said get the binoculars,but they wernt very good.they must have been there for a good 5 mins and one of them seemed to just gradualy fade away,sort of upwardsly,I thought it had gone behind a cloud,but there wasnt any clouds in the sky,it was as clear as anything.by this time the plane was flown away.Then about a minuet after ,the other one gradually faded away,upwards.I know they seemed to fade,because my husbands eyesight isnt as good as mine,and when he said it had disapeared,I could still see it,fading away."],"Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"3 bright orange ,oversized star like objects,hovering in a triangular formation"}
