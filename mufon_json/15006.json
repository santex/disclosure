It was on the HBCCUFO.org sight, and has been taken down since last night. I went outside, and we watched this thing stay perfectly still, while watching the stars change position, as usual. It was very cloudy, and this thing was below the clouds. It brightened to the size of a dime, from our viewpoint, and occasionally dimmed, but only briefly. It seemed to split and remerge. After 8:00 I went back out and it was gone. I had seen a ufo back in June, so I wasn't suprised at this, but we were uneasy."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.562134,+-117.209493(15006)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15006) map </A>","Region":"California","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Murrieta","There were no other sightings in Murrieta on or around January 19th 2009"]}
