When she yelled \" what is that\", and ran out of the house. We all got up and ran out behind her, when we got outside we all saw what she was yelling about.It was a disc shaped craft, floating above our barn. I remember thinking I could hit it with a rock! The craft was so low, maybe 20 feet above our barn. My whole family was just standing there,watching it. There was no sound coming from it at all. Then it started slowly moving over our house. I remember my mom saying \"I am calling the police\".She barely got the words out of her mouth when the craft started moving passed our house and in seconds it was gone. The craft it was round and white, with 4 lights on the bottom. After it was gone I dont remember anyone saying anything about what we just saw. Just lately I have brought it up to my family and they remember it just like me. So as a young girl I knew that we are not alone.The encounter lasted about 15or20 min."],"Date of the Event":"04/30/1984 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Log Number":"US-06112010-0010","Longitude":"-96.685017","Summary":"Saw a ufo over my barn!","Region":"Oklahoma","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Prague","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path","Date Submitted":"06/11/2010 11:56 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23702.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23702.html"],"Latitude":"35.486737","Disposition":"Unknown"}
