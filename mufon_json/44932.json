Steady speed. Seen by 8 people.","Longitude":"-112.104011","divs":["Sighting DetailsSeveral of us were sitting outside in my friend's back yard at 11:30 pm last night. I looked at the sky to the North and noticed an orange light, moving steadily closer from North. We watched as the light moved Southward and then turned to the East over the course of 2 - 3 minutes, disappearing in the East. The night was clear and essentially cloudless, with no wind at ground level. The object made no sound, did not seem to change altitude, nor did it vary brightness. It seemed like it was too high to make out a distinct shape. I have not seen an orange light in the sky before and no one else who saw the light ( 8 people together) had any idea what it was. We watched it until it disappeared in the East sky. Thank you for taking this information."],"Object Features":"None","City":"Phoenix","trends":["There have been 417 other sightings in Phoenix","There were no other sightings in Phoenix on or around December 31st 2012"],"Date of the Event":"12/31/2012 11:30 UTC","Region":"Arizona","Log Number":"US-01012013-0057","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44932.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44932.html"],"Latitude":"33.485831","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere, Star-like","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"01/01/2013 11:53 UTC","Case Number":"44932"}
