As we were right in front of Bill's Suburban which is between 13 Mile Road and Common my husdand noticed something strange. He looked up and said \"What the hell is that?\" I looked up and saw this object as it was hovering over our vehicle. I watched it float up and up. It looked to me as if it were a white plastic bag with a flame inside. But if it were a plastic bag, the flame would have melted the bag. And if it were a flame inside, it was not flickering as a flame should. I kept watching it to see where it was going and to see what the heck it was. All of sudden it picked up speed and floated higher and higher until it disappeared. We were terrified and it made the hair on our arms stand up on end. I wish I would have gotten a picture of it but it happened so fast."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28899.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28899.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.503058,+-82.933141(28899)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28899) map </A>","Date of the Event":"05/01/2011 09:51 UTC","Longitude":"-82.933141","Region":"Michigan","City":"Roseville","Country":"United States","Latitude":"42.503058","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"05/01/2011 10:27 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Roseville","There were no other sightings in Roseville on or around May 1st 2011"],"Case Number":"28899"}
