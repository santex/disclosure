{"Log Number":"US-05212012-0016","divs":["Sighting DetailsOur campsite was witness to this event. We witnessed a numerous number of lights in the night sky. This event was in Pickstown South Dakota at Fort Randall Dam. I was fishing of the bank around 9:00pm on 5-17-12 and a storm front was moving in. Just over the horizon 2 sets of orange orbs appear out of nowhere. The orbs were orange in color and appeared in a straight formation parallel to the horizon. They appeared only for a few seconds then disappeared. I tried to get the images on my camera and it was unsuccessful. 15 mins later a squadron of jet fighters circled the area and look like the were sweeping the area around the sight. At first, we thought it was military training activities with flares. The more I thought about it, flares don't stay stationary. Or do they? I also believe that the military would not be flying 15 or more jets in this sortie."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"05/17/2012 12:00 UTC","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.972035,+-99.899513(38331)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38331) map </A>","Case Number":"38331","Latitude":"43.972035","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38331.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38331.html"],"City":"Fort Randall Dam","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Sphere","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/21/2012 10:30 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Fort Randall Dam","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-99.899513","Region":"South Dakota","Summary":"orange orbs that appeared in front of a storm cloud"}
