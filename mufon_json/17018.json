Once we cleared the trees the object was nowhere to be found.","City":"Carol Stream","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting Details2 co-workers and myself were on our way to eat lunch when I noticed a very bright, shiny, object just ahead of us and to the right a bit. This object was approximately two to three hundred feet in the air and I guess maybe 2 blocks or so ahead of us. If you completely extended your arm out in front of you, you could use your thumb to cover the object up. It was somewhat hard for me to judge distances since I was the driving and it all happened really fast. Anyway a tree growing along the side of North Avenue momentarily obscured our view of the object. It lasted for maybe only a second or two. Just long enough for my Chevy Silverado to pass the tree doing 45 mph. Once we had completely passed the tree I was completely, totally taken by surprise! The object was now nowhere in sight. I was expecting to see some part of an airplane because we were kind of close to O���Hare Airport. So believing I had just seen a plane turning in the sun and its wings were reflecting after catching the sun. But NO! Nothing at all! Just blue sky. There was not a cloud, a bird or shiny object anywhere to be seen. I asked Rob my co-worker \"did you see that\"? He told me yes he too had seen a very bright, shiny, flashy object in the same area of the sky. But could not explain what happened to it. It was just gone! So not sure what we seen but we both agreed if it were a plane we should had picked it back up after passing the tree. Bruce Brewer"],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:05"}
