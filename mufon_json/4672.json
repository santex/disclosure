{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was driving and listening to my radio. The broadcast was interrupted as a spacecraft shaped like an Egg seemed to float in front of my windshield. The egg communicated to me over my radio. It advised the reason for their trip, was to explain how they were able to defy the earth's understanding of physics and the ability to go beyond the speed of light and thus beyond relativity theories. They said their next contact with me would be a mathematical brief to explain all. They also said they would do this only upon the caveat that religion does not play a role in any meetings. The egg then seemed to become subject to earth's gravity and appeared to fall off the front of my car. I stopped to see what had happened, but all that was left was just scrambled egg."],"Disposition":"Hoax","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.733678,+-127.642911(4672)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (4672) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/15/2006 12:00 UTC","Country":"Canada","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"01/15/2006 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-04102006-0005","Case Number":"4672","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"British Columbia","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4672.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4672.html"],"Summary":"message","Latitude":"53.733678","City":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-127.642911","Object Shape":"Egg","trends":[],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
