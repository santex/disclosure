{"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy husband and I were driving around in our convertable about 9 pm Sunday June 12, 2011 when I happen to look up and saw this really bright round object in the sky. It got extremely bright and then it got real dim. It did this several times. At first I thought this was a falling star but it moved from west to east. I watched until it finally went out of sight. This was really strange. It was not an airplane or helicopter. It sounds like the persons in KY and CA saw what I saw."],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"San Angelo","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"Real bright object in sw sky.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.470142,+-100.434398(29566)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29566) map </A>","Country":"United States","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29566.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29566.html"],"Log Number":"US-06152011-0011","Longitude":"-100.434398","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"06/15/2011 05:27 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/12/2011 09:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in San Angelo","There were no other sightings in San Angelo on or around June 12th 2011"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Case Number":"29566","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"31.470142","Region":"Texas"}
