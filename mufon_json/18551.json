We observed a red light in the sky that appeared to have other smaller red lights below or around it. The red light was as large as one of the planets and was due south of us. It also appeared to be higher in the sky than the flight path normally taken by planes flying to our local airports. As the two of us watched it over a period of time of about 15 minutes, we observed three things in particular. First, the light would slowly get brighter, then dim, then get brighter, then dim. At the brightest, it was red but as bright as Venus. At the faintest, it was still as bright as most stars. Secondly, it appeared to be motionless for at least five minutes, if not longer as we first watched it. We ruled out flares and fireworks of any kind because it was just there, not moving, just changing its brightness. Third, we realized that it was finally moving and appeared to be actually drifting up and to our left in an approximately 45 degree angle eastward. This took an estimated ten minutes. It then disappeared before it reached where the moon was but the moon���s light was not the reason it disappeared���it just finally faded out completely."],"trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in El Cajon","There were 5 other sightings in El Cajon on or around July 4th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.801163,+-116.954897(18551)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18551) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"18551","Log Number":"US-08092009-0001"}
