I was looking at the moon and I just got this feeling that something was else there.I stared at it for about 5 minutes wondering what might be hiding behind the brightness of the moon.(ok,a very strong feeling).I noticed a bright light off to the upper left it didn't move so i thought it might be a planet. i grabbed my trusty Olympus D-560 zoom and turned off the flash was quite suprised when I took it to the digital processing kiosk at a local Rite- Aid .Pretty interesting \"planet\"? What really got me was the Large object on the lower left.The pics are as close asI could zoom so you willstill need a magnifying glass to get the total effect here."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Corona"}
