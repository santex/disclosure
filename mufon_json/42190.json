{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThe object I witnessed wasn't a normal object in our everyday lives. It had unusual lights meaning no navigational lighting at all. It was one solid orb of light that disappeared than reappeared in many different locations as if it jumped threw space and time to a location near its previous location. It did this four times the object I believe was one object. The elevations and locations mimiked one another and had cordination. It was very unusual and clearly connected in that action of the last unusual light. This happened over a period of a few minuits than it moved up and away at a great speed."],"trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Charlotte","There were 2 other sightings in Charlotte on or around August 31st 2012"],"Latitude":"35.110183","City":"Charlotte","Log Number":"US-09012012-0008","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Region":"North Carolina","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42190.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42190.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.110183,+-80.775307(42190)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42190) map </A>","Date Submitted":"09/01/2012 04:55 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/31/2012 09:02 UTC","Summary":"Witnessed UFO orb like object disappear and reappear in many locations.","Case Number":"42190","Longitude":"-80.775307","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
