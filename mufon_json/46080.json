{"Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","divs":["Sighting DetailsAs I was driving home from work, I noticed a flashing blue-white light to the south just west of Emmetsburg. My first thought was that it was lightning, but the flashing was regular and always in one spot from the ground. The light was very bright and flashed once every second or two. Very near, just to the left, was a second light shining at an angle into the sky and rotating. Glancing over as often as possible, I could sometimes make out through the trees a row of red-orange lights along the ground. Very shortly after noticing this, I pulled over to watch, but saw nothing more than the regular flashing, so after several minutes I decided that I couldn���t sit on the side of the road and watch a flashing light all night and, being somewhat new to the area, that I didn���t trust myself to navigate the side roads to try to chase after it. I didn���t see any more than just the lights, so I can���t be sure I saw a spaceship, but if it was, judging by the lights I could make out through the trees, it was very large. I hope someone else got a chance to see more than I did and reported it also."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46080.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46080.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"46080","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Emmetsburg","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.681944","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Flashing blue-white light","City":"Emmetsburg","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.111111,+-94.681944(46080)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46080) map </A>","Date of the Event":"03/07/2013 11:10 UTC","Log Number":"US-03082013-0002","Country":"United States","Latitude":"43.111111","Region":"Iowa","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/08/2013 01:36 UTC"}
