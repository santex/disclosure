The two solid lights were flying at a decent pace, I quickly rolled my windows down to see if I could hear anything. but it was silent, no noise at all. The lights passed over my house and there were gone. I've never seen anything like that fly over before. I can't imagine it being a helicopter for a number of reasons. Like I said before the lights were too far apart for a helicopter, the objects seemed to be moving too fast for a helicopter, and it was too low for it to be a commercial airplane. The absent of noise also threw me off. I walked inside and on my computer I searched a short description of what I had seen. The Blue Springs, Missouri reportings seem to be something with similar characteristics. Except the two lights were moving."],"Longitude":"-90.375575","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"38685","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Missouri","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Latitude":"38.397816","Viewing Distance":"N/A","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38685.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38685.html"],"Log Number":"US-05312012-0006","Summary":"matches blue springs sightings except this one had two different objects in motion","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Arnold","There were no other sightings in Arnold on or around May 31st 2012"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States"}
