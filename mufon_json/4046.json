Visiting an army base with my friend, a colonel (retired now) 2. Both were exposed on a little central place 3. I thought it was a sort of joke 4. Both were round and flat; like saucers indeed. They seemed to be made of aluminium and had a kind of plexiglass dome 5. I walked to the objects, looked in them and touched them 6. I was called back (was ordered to stand back) BUT MOST IMPORTANT: I WAS TOLD THEY THEY HAD ACTUALLY FLOWN! SO, I BELIEVE EVERYBODY WHO SAYS TO HAVE SEEN AN UFO. ONLY: WAS IT EXTRATERRESTIAL?"],"Log Number":"US-10312005-0001","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"saw and touched 2 ufos"}
