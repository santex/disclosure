This thing was hanging very far away from me to the southeast...I am located in Park Ridge. At first, I thought it was Venus, it was the brightest thing I have ever seen in the sky. Even with the sun coming up...IT WAS VERY NOTICEABLE. Now I am reporting this before I take off for work. EVEN IF PEOPLE WERE NOT LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION WOULD BE DRAWN TO NOTICE THIS GIGANTIC OBJECT...EVEN IF IT WAS JUST VENUS. THERE HAS TO BE MORE WITNESSES...Chicago commuters on trains and subways or waiting for the train and cars heading on the Kennedy or I-90 East...with a clear view toward the SOUTHWEST would have seen it for certain. All these folks are heading that way...stuck in traffic...THEY HAD TO HAVE SEEN THIS THING. Oh...and aircraft were taking off in that general vicinity from O'Hare, Absolutely GIGANTIC bright light...in a perfect circle. Why was it NOT Venus? Because OUT OF NOWHERE...AFTER A FEW SECONDS...THE DAMN THING JUST ALL OF SUDDEN...VANISHED!! It did NOT fade away...or get covered by clouds...it just SHUT OFF. I waited for it to reappear, and sure enough it did...AND THEN STARTED MOVING WEST CLEAR AS DAY...IT MOVED WEST FOR ABOUT 2 SECONDS...THEN DISAPPEARED AGAIN. I grabbed my camera and went outside hoping it was coming in this direction...I waited and waited and waited...and looked up. There was the REAL VENUS...TINY. I am speechless right now...that was, by far the coolest thing I have ever seen. In surrounding areas Southwest of Chicago...THEY WERE EVEN CLOSER AND THE VIEW WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR...IT WAS ALMOST BLINDING BRIGHT...LIKE NOTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. It was like a gigantic ball of lightning...hovering...like some big planet, but it vanished, re-appeared...moved WEST SLOWLY...and disappeared again. You can see Venus right now...in the Midwest...it is tiny. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT THING? ANYONE ELSE SEE IT? I HOPE TO SEE ADDITIONAL REPORTS WHEN I GET HOME FROM WORK!! ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU FROM THE SOUTHWEST SIDE OF CHICAGO...ANYONE WITH A CLEAR VIEW FROM THOSE AREAS WOULD HAVE HAD THE BEST VIEW OF IT...it was also one of the largest moving crafts I have ever seen in the sky...beyond anything normal...PLANET SIZE."],"Case Number":"26997","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26997.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26997.html"],"Summary":"Brightest Object I have ever seen in the sky Southeast of Chicago.","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 221 other sightings in Chicago","There were no other sightings in Chicago on or around December 15th 2010"],"Date Submitted":"12/15/2010 08:40 UTC","Latitude":"41.885104","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Sphere","City":"Chicago","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.624968","Date of the Event":"12/15/2010 12:00 UTC"}
