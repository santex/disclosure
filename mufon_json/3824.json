I was looking at some stars when an object at high altitude passed my field of vision. 3. At first though it was a plane, but seemed unusual and no engine noises. 4. It was traveling south in a straight line. It seemed to be illuinated (glowing) did not have the normal distinct nagvigational lights of an aircraft. Sort of reddish and hazy. Possiby cross shaped but hard to discern. seemed to be traveling fast. (but not zipping by) 5. I wanted to get a longer look at it and it was unusual enough that I kept watching it to figure out what it was. I live about 40 miles from Kennedy Airport & Laguardia so I've seen many aircraft in the skies at night. This was definately unusual. 6. I lost sight as it passed over my trees and could not see it again."],"Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.864281,+-73.197959(3824)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3824) map </A>","Longitude":"-73.197959","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-09072005-0004","Object Shape":"Undisclosed","City":"Smithtown","Case Number":"3824","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3824.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3824.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Smithtown","There were no other sightings in Smithtown on or around September 6th 2005"],"Latitude":"40.864281","Date of the Event":"09/06/2005 10:58 UTC","Tags":"City","Summary":"Noticed object in sky traveling south, possibly cross shaped, seemed to glow sort of fuzzy, sort of reddish","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"New York"}
