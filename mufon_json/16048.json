I would like to know if anyone has seen something similar to this. We live on a farm in the country and something was setting off my driveway sensor for several nights. Our dog Charlie was disturbed about this but I was unable to spot the source of his concern. After several nights I installed my wildlife camera below the driveway sensor and captured the attached images. The quality is not that great. I have no idea what could have made this light. The camera was facing north into the woods on a hill, no way it could have been a car or lights from afar. Any info on similar light formations would be appreciated."],"Summary":"Vertical light appeared from the woods - set off driveway alarm.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16048.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16048_submitter_file1__MDGC0001.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/16048_submitter_file2__MDGC0002.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16048.html"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
