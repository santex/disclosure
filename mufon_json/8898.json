{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was trying to capture lightning from a distant storm. I was using 35mm film and a tripod bracketing exposures from 1 to 5 seconds. I had pointed my camera (Nikon FM2) in the general direction from which the lightning was accuring. Using a cable release to trip the shutter so that no camera shake would be transfered to the picture. When the lightning would flash I would trip the shutter. I had no idea that I was capturing anything other than the lightning until I got the film processed and printed. There are 3 clear images of what appears to be a UFO. I am a professional photographer and in no way have I manipulated or enhanced these exposures. I can't remember the exact date when these were shot."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/14/2003 12:00 UTC","Object Shape":"Triangle","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8898.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/8898_submitter_file1__ufo3picsemailphp.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8898.html"],"trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Morrilton","There were no other sightings in Morrilton on or around March 14th 2003","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Arkansas","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"03/14/2003 12:00 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.156937,+-92.734154(8898)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8898) map </A>","City":"Morrilton","Latitude":"35.156937","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-01152008-0041","Case Number":"8898","Summary":"Black Triangle","Longitude":"-92.734154"}
