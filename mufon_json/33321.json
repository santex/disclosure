We witnessed it hovering, moving up, making a change in direction and going right. We watch the night sky each night, we have NEVER seen anything that looks like this. It was not Jupiter or Mars. We used a telescope to look at it, and saw a glowing sphere that changed colors. It seemed to have Electricity pulsating all over the sphere, kinda like a plasma ball. It had almost all colors of the rainbow in it. Main ones being white, red, blue, green. We had a measuring item to watch it rise up. We used the power lines. It started below the line and ended up way above the line and further off to the right. We know enough that we are pretty confident it was not a star or a planet. Especially due to it's constant moving and changing directions in moving. It was very high up, I would actually say it was in space, not closer to earth. Very distant appearance."],"Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Winter Springs","Tags":"City","Latitude":"28.699773","Viewing Distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
