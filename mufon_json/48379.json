{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving home on I-80 going west. Asked my mom what the red-orange lights were to the north. She said, \"well, I think those are the lights that are on telephone lines.\" I said, \"no, they are moving.\" Turned off on Tiffin, Iowa exit to watch. Tried to videotape with my mom's phone, but cannot make out the shapes as there was too much light and distance for camera to capture. There were approximately 12 ufos.
