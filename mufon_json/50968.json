I asked my wife \"What is that???\" I said \"It's not of this world.\" I had watery eyes because I knew what I was seeing was not an every day event. We observed it for about a minute and then it faded out for about 45 seconds to a minute. In the same place, it came right back again. It moved slightly to the left, then slightly to the right. Then, it appeared to come forward slightly. That was about another 45 seconds to a minute. Then it disappeared for another minute and then it came back again and lit up again. The same thing happened for another minute. Then it lit up and never came back. My wife and I went back to our car to get our camera, but it never reappeared. (This took place by Concordia Lutheran School.)"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Dome","Date Submitted":"09/21/2013 11:55 UTC","trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Penticton","There were no other sightings in Penticton on or around September 1st 2013"],"City":"Penticton"}
