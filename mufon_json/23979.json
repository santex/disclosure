I am an armature astronomer, these objects were certainly not any planets, satellites, or shooting stars. the brightest of the objects was about -4. the others about -2 or -3. the objects were at about 25 degrees above the horizon when i first observed them. and were about 35 degrees above the horizon when they faded out and disappeared. the objects were first observed in the south east, and disappeared in the east."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Other"}
