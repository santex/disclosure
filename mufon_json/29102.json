{"Latitude":"34.137358","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was inspecting the roof of a house I was interested in purchasing & later that evening, while looking at my photographs of the damaged roof on the house, I noticed two dark round objects in my photo. They did not make a sound & I was not aware of them when taking the photo. They do not look like birds, they are too round. This was just a couple miles from the Twentynine Palms US. Marine Corps base. I was wondering if anyone else saw something that day."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.137358,+-116.045809(29102)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29102) map </A>","Log Number":"US-05152011-0006","Region":"California","Longitude":"-116.045809","Date Submitted":"05/15/2011 09:00 UTC","Case Number":"29102","City":"Twentynine Palms","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29102.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29102_submitter_file1__RoofDamageUFOs_edited-1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29102_submitter_file2__RoofDamageUFOs.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/29102_submitter_file3__064.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29102.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Disc","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Twentynine Palms","There were no other sightings in Twentynine Palms on or around May 7th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/07/2011 02:15 UTC","Summary":"Two dark round objects near the US.
