I ran out onto my front porch with my two children just in time to see a red light fly over directly over our house with a helicopter close behind. They continued east until they both disappeared. The helicopter was very loud and didn't sound like a medical helicopter. It sounded more like a military helicopter because of it's size and sound. The helicopter had blinking white lights on it. The red light was just a red light. Nothing more. I have no idea what it was."],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Date of the Event":"02/02/2011 08:10 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"Red Light followed by helicopter","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Milton"}
