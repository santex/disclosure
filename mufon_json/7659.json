They allways seem to pass over my house, so I was trying to get some photos. I was playing around with my digital camera and added an IR lens filter. There were no clouds and it was sunny and clear. As I was taking a series of photos, I could see nothing. but as I was viewing the photos something showed up. Condensation maybe? no clouds and humidity was very low. you be the judge as I am reluctant to call it a ufo. i did try to duplicate the photo not five minuets later without success. Some of my friends say it could be the Goodyear blimp, but i should have seen it while I was taking the photo. others say I doctored it in photoshop. I did not in any way doctor the photo. Two photos are attached. The first one was just lightened a little."],"Object Shape":"Disc, Egg, Saturn-like","Date Submitted":"08/05/2007 01:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7659.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7659_submitter_file1__UFO1.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7659_submitter_file2__UFO.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7659.html"],"Date of the Event":"08/05/2007 01:30 UTC"}
