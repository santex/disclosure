{"Object Shape":"Triangle","Country":"United States","Summary":"Triangle three white lights one red flashing in center, no noise","divs":["Sighting Details10:37pm I was just now looking up into the sky hoping to see something from inside and it glided right over my place. I saw it clear as a bell. Triangular shaped craft with three white outer lights and a flashing red center light just above the redwoods. It was not in the flight path of regular airplanes and it was silent. At first I thought I saw something way up star distance away that disappeared and then this came around from the other direction ( heading west then veering south ) just after that. Then it disappeared past the tree line toward the ocean. It looked familiar. I saw one back in 1991 hovering above the trees in Vermont. I was scarred back then but not this time. Now 10:52pm saw a shooting star due north coming from the direction the triangle went in. The skies were clear with no wind."],"trends":["There have been 127 other sightings in San Francisco","There were no other sightings in San Francisco on or around August 8th 2009"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.78177,+-122.409516(18594)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18594) map </A>","Log Number":"US-08112009-0002","Date Submitted":"08/08/2009 10:37 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"San Francisco","Date of the Event":"08/08/2009 10:37 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"18594","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18594.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18594.html"],"Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Latitude":"37.78177","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-122.409516","Tags":"City"}
