They were orangy red in color, but seemed to shift or pulsate to more red or more yellow as we watched them. We spotted 4 originally, and then a fifth light further away. We thought maybe they were airplanes, but they did not blink like planes do and they did not seem to be moving in any obvious direction. They seemed to \"wander\" around the portion of sky they were in, never movie very far from each other but definitely changing places and moving around. My sister and I tried to keep an eye on them as we drove home, but they seemed to disappear one by one. We finally lost the last one behind the trees. It was a very odd experience as none of us could seem to identify the lights. They didn't even really look like helicopters. It was really weird. Having seen The Darkest Hour earlier didn't help."],"Object Shape":"Fireball, Sphere, Star-like","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None, Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Latitude":"34.106757","Log Number":"US-01142012-0015","Date of the Event":"01/14/2012 09:45 UTC","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Woodstock","There were no other sightings in Woodstock on or around January 14th 2012"],"City":"Woodstock","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34855.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34855.html"],"Summary":"Red/Orange/Yellow Lights in Sky","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.106757,+-84.510205(34855)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34855) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
