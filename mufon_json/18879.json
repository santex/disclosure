There is a possibility that the light is a reflection from the sun or an object speeding by. The shot was captured with a DSLR Sony Alpha 100 with a 75-300 mm lens. I noticed the object after shooting and viewing shots in the computer. I changed the color and light saturation in order to view the object with editing one shot to show the full picture and then changed views of the original. When I saw the object, it looked like something streaming by. I never saw the object while driving and shooting scenes of traffic and buildings in the Miami area."],"Longitude":"-80.225429"}
