Another discovery that I have made is I have captured the object frame by frame and when the object comes to a stop I have enlarged that Frame in photoshop and it looks like a face in that object! Kinda Spooky. Another thing is the 2 small lightning looking straks coming from an object in the sky, now thats weird. Also NOTE: The vertical line that you see is a 2 meter Antenna mounted on the roof of my truck and is used as reference to show the camera is not moving. I think the probe comes in to take either a look at me and my filming or is checking out the infrared light source. Just 14 mins later I see another Pulsating Object in the sky. I think this object and the weird lightning looking streaks have something to do with this UFO."],"Disposition":"IFO","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
