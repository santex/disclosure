First we we stopped at Goldfield Ghost Town, but it was packed, so instead of stopping we just decided to drive the series of highways that make up the Apache Trail, that goes completely around the Superstition Mountains. I do not remember exactly where we stopped on the hwy for this picture, but it was early in the trip before the 3 lakes. Anyway took the picture, downloaded it to my computer and there it was. I have no idea what that thing is, but if you have some idea, I would like the information.
