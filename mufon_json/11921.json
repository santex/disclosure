Moving quickly, but not like a shooting star. Totally silent. Flew overhead, got very bright, then faded to black as it moved. The point where it faded to black had 4 lights in a diamond formation. Those were not as bright as the original light. It definitely wasn't an airplane or satellite."],"Longitude":"-105.076203"}
