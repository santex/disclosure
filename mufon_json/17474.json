{"divs":["Sighting DetailsAround 10:58 PM EST I witnessed what seemed like a star moving over the sky heading in a curved shaped path at an increasing rate of speed before disappearing after passing the big dipper. Over the past 4 months I have seen 4 of these object in various locations in the sky after 8:30 PM to 1 AM EST In Canton, north Georgia (usually when I go in my backyard and look up at the night sky when having a cigarette.) I will begin recording with a camera as soon as I can pick one up, due to the recent frequency of sightings.
