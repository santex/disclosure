Southern California at this time was covered in dark, gray skies. The object appeared through the cloud formations and appeared not to move for prolonged periods of time. After approximately twenty minutes, in seemed to recede farther in the distance until completely enveloped by the clouds. When seen moving, the craft sailed upon a straight trajectory (indicating intelligently-controlled) and also arced high and behind the tree seen in the photograph.
