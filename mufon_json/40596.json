{"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Independence","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe were celebrating with fireworks when Aaron (10yrs old) said look what's that. His mother exclaimed UFO and I saw what I now have to say was a UFO very explainable, Here is the reply to case # that I gave: We saw two of the exact same objects flying in a type of formation, same height as you described and flying at a steady speed. By the time I got my video camera and ran to the front of our house to avoid trees it was traveling away from us. I got some pretty good video of them but i couldn't hold the video cam still and with nothing for reference it appears as if they were darting back and forth and actually it was me zooming in and out and trying to keep them both in picture. They stayed in the same formation and speed as they traveled east out of sight. I live on R.D. Mize about a mile from the old airport. Strangest unexplainable thing we have ever seen."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-94.327728","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.054813,+-94.327728(40596)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (40596) map </A>","Summary":"Red objects in sky over Indep Mo","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/08/2012 07:32 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/40596.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/40596.html"],"Object Features":"Dome","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 67 other sightings in Independence","There was one other sighting in Independence on or around July 7th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 1 time.",""],"Log Number":"US-07082012-0015","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Region":"Missouri","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"39.054813","Date of the Event":"07/07/2012 11:00 UTC","Case Number":"40596","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00"}
