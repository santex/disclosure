It appeared as a star first then I realized it was not when it started zig zagging in the sky. Up and down, left and right etc. I called a friend who also observed this. I watched this activity take place for over an hour and eventually got too tired to continue. Upon checking back maybe 30 minutes after ceasing, it was no longer in the sky. The odd thing was that it responded to my mental requests. When I would ask it to go up or down it would. The same happened with left and right movement. The craft appeared very responsive to mental communication and non threatening. I called a friend who also observed this activity with his girlfriend out their window in the city of Highlands Ranch. I have a cell phone video which is very dark, but you can see the craft blinking in and out a little bit. Will submit soon."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/28/2013 02:05 UTC","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-02282013-0011","Case Number":"45960","City":"Castle Rock","Summary":"Bright object in sky dances for an hour over Castle Rock/ Sedalia","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Castle Rock","There were no other sightings in Castle Rock on or around February 27th 2013"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Latitude":"39.377112","Region":"Colorado","Date of the Event":"02/27/2013 11:01 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
