Some moving quickly back and forth, some hovering. She ran in yelling for everyone to come out and see this. At first we were shocked, but we all ran out (myself, daughter and friend with my wife) and we all stood in shock. Some of the lights had a V shape some round, the they merged into two or three and zipped behind a cloud, then two came out. She called for her sister, who lives close by to look up and she saw two UFO's, just as what we were seeing at that moment. My wife only then thought to take a cell phone picture, but couldn't get it as she was nervous and fidgety, and soon they just disappeared, we think behind a small cloud formation, but we are not sure."],"Latitude":"47.305747","Log Number":"US-09042013-0002","Object Features":"Appendage(s)"}
