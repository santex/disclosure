{"Date of the Event":"09/03/2007 01:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was looking east at the Sandia mountains when a bright fireball appeared entering the atmosphere like a meteorite. It appeared to me at about 20,000 feet coming in parallel to the Earths gravitational field. It was as bright as the moon and the size of a quarter at arms length at a distance of about 1,5000 feet. Just above the Sandia mountains at about 14,000 feet it changed course perpendicular to the Earths gravitational field. It disappeared in a couple of seconds after course correction. It appeared to me to glow only when it needed sufficient energy to change angular momentum. It either disappeared when it flew beyond my view on the other side of the Sandia mountain range or when it no longer needed the energy for course correction. It made absolutely no sound and was the brightest, fastest craft I have ever witnessed changing course at supersonic speed in an instant."],"Log Number":"US-09032007-0012","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"35.093621","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/03/2007 01:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","City":"Albuquerque","Longitude":"-106.649837","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7833.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7833.html"],"trends":["There have been 129 other sightings in Albuquerque","There were no other sightings in Albuquerque on or around September 3rd 2007"],"Region":"New Mexico","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Fireball","Sighting Duration":"00:00:10","Case Number":"7833","Summary":"Fireball came in at steep angle and changed direction instantaneously","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.093621,+-106.649837(7833)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7833) map </A>","Country":"United States"}
