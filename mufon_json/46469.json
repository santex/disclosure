Many planes searched after, very fast.","trends":[],"divs":["Sighting DetailsMy wife called stating she saw lights like a plane very low to the ground but much different. A center red blinking light and 2 constant white lights on either side. In a swept V formation. As she called me, I went out side and noticed several aircraft flying towards the area she described. All the air craft had the same navigational lights as each other, flashing in the same sequence. They also had red and white lights only. The other aircraft flew East then West and back again, finally going West. All just South of us. The pursuit aircraft were much, much faster than the commercial aircraft in the area. The commercial aircraft had much different navigational lights, flashing much more often, red green and white. The commercial were flying at less then half the speed we saw the pursuit aircraft traveling. This event is getting pretty standard for the area."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.324144,+-85.600324(46469)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46469) map </A>","Longitude":"-85.600324","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"46469","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Log Number":"US-03282013-0018","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"03/28/2013 10:55 UTC","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46469.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46469.html"],"Source":"MUFON"}
