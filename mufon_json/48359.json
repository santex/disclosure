It was mostly a clear sky with some thin clouds in the far back ground. From the west,(my right I seen about 4 solid red lights fly east fairly quickly and form a diamond shape pattern and hover, then I seen a trail of a few 4-6 more come from the same direction and join the diamond shape almost changing it to a circular shape of red lights then one by one they left the circle and headed east individually and every one of them just disappeared not because they were out of my line of vision just vanished instantly. I had my iphone and tried to take pictures they are very grainy only one picture shows 4 whitish circles as I seen forming the diamond shape. I went in house and got my 14 year old son to witness he did see the tale end of this strange event. He did see the last 4-6 head east and disappear."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/48359.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/48359.html"],"Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"06/23/2013 01:58 UTC","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"06/22/2013 10:15 UTC","Longitude":"-120.552501","Latitude":"43.806133","Log Number":"US-06232013-0022","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"48359","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"red lights traveling from west to east forming a pattern ,then hovering then disappear","trends":[],"Region":"Oregon","Object Shape":"Circle"}
