I looked up over the orchard, and saw a bright light in the sky, in the distance. It looked like a huge, bright star. I called to my husband, \"honey, come look at the UFO\". I knew immediately that it was not the usual air traffic, we were seeing. It was slowly moving downward. But it just hovered for at least 2-3 minutes. I went inside to get my binoculars, to get a better look. When looking through them I could see what looked to be four bright lights, blinding me with a flashing light up top. The light was very bright. As we watched it slowly disappeared behind the tree line. We just walked back inside and forgot about it, till we saw the news, about the sighting. This isn't my first sighting, so I wasn't to surprised to have seen it. And as we walked inside I told me husband, that there had to be other people that saw it too."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"24424","City":"Clovis","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Bright like a star, with binoculars bright lights with one flashing above.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.833098,+-119.700179(24424)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24424) map </A>"}
