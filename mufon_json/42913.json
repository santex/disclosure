The phone disconnects so I went outside to see if I could see what they saw and I saw about 5-10 lights in the sky becoming brighter and all together in a circle, then break apart into a line. I called to everyone in the house to come out and see the lights. As they came out I went in to get my camera, when I turned on the camera I found the batteries dead. I went back in to get batteries and came out and started recording the video. The video is grainy at some points but when I zoom out it does look clearer. I took another video after with some lights before they completely stopped. These lights seemed to be coming from behind the clouds and lit up the clouds they were near. They moved quickly at times and hovered at other times. I heard no noise and just kept thinking what could this be! My friend took video with his phone at the same time, from the corner of my street. I would really love to know what we saw."],"Summary":"Saw lights in the sky moving in odd ways","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Philadelphia","trends":["There have been 216 other sightings in Philadelphia","There were 2 other sightings in Philadelphia on or around September 29th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"40.126524","Date Submitted":"09/30/2012 03:27 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42913.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42913.html"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Unknown"}
