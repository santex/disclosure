As I watched the spectacle I noticed it moving a bit at first, I blew it off as a star. About a half hour later I returned to my porch to smoke a cigarette and noticed it was a little higher in the sky and still moving, this time it was definitely moving about the sky and not with the earths rotation. This is not the first time I have seen something like this.
