At first, I thought it was a plane but then i went inside my house and took binoculars and sat outside looking at this object. When I first saw it, it was so bright, and blinking everynow and then, not typical of a plane that sits in one place. I also had notcied that it revolved around in circles similar to spinning, which made me think, \"mhmm this is interesting.\" Basically when i sat outside watching, the object would remain visable for about 10 minutes and then dissapper for about 5 min. Then it would reapper off and on. This lasted for about 50 min. I think that this is definetly a UFO and I actually tried calling the Franlkin Institute in Philadelphia to report this sighting, however, they were closed. Finally, after the 50 minutes, its dissappeared and i went inside. Who knows, it could even be out there right now."],"Case Number":"13099","Object Shape":"Cone, Flash, Triangle","Date of the Event":"10/18/2008 09:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Wyndmoor","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.082642,+-75.180544(13099)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13099) map </A>","Disposition":"Unknown","Latitude":"40.082642","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/18/2008 09:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Wyndmoor","There were no other sightings in Wyndmoor on or around October 18th 2008"],"Object Features":"Dome, Wings","Region":"Pennsylvania","Longitude":"-75.180544","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00"}
