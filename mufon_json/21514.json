{"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","divs":["sighting detailssighted as i was walking my dog in front of my parent's house. the object is still in the air as i type this report, and continues to rise slowly. it appears as an orange light from a distance, but with binoculars it is visible as a triangle or maybe a \"p\" shape. it rises slowly, but is also moving very erratically, with jerks to the right and left. it was first viewed at maybe a 1\\2 mile into the air, and while viewing it, an aircraft angled toward it. my brother, nephew and niece dismissed it as \"just a light\" when we viewed it behind objects, only to see it move from behind them. this is the second sighting of this ufo, according to my brother, who saw it the night before. i am normally skeptical of such events, but being unable to dismiss it as a natural or man-made occurrence, i can only classify it as ufo."],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Brunswick","There were no other sightings in Brunswick on or around January 15th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"01/15/2010 08:15 UTC","Log Number":"US-01152010-0018","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21514.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21514.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Disposition":"IFO","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.154213,+-81.487859(21514)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21514) map </A>","Summary":"Orange Light UFO in Brunswick GA","Case Number":"21514","City":"Brunswick","Date Submitted":"01/15/2010 08:40 UTC","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Circle","Longitude":"-81.487859","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Weather Factors":"None","Region":"Georgia","Object Features":"Other","Latitude":"31.154213"}
