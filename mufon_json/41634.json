Initially I saw a bright orange light in the sky which was stationary. I said \"what is that\". My mother who was driving my car looked up and couldnt see anything, a tree had obstructed the view. Once we passed the tree the light was visable once again. It was a glowing ball of fire almost, appeared very round, but had a haze of transparent orange surrounding it. Perhaps it was a glow. She immediately stopped the car, this was 2 blocks from my house. Right away, 6 more appeared in the sky. Bright, large, all identical and all in somewhat of a formations it seemed. There were some other neighbors out which were taking pictures of this also. I grabbed my phone and snapped a shot. For some reason it only picked up one of the 7 lights, and it looked so much smaller and dimmer in the picture. Soon after I snapped the picture it appeared as if they were rising, and getting somewhat smaller... they then began to blink, or go out but come back on spiratically. We proceeded to get back in the car to see if we could drive in the direction of them, and as we did... about a mile into it they had completely all went out just like that and disappeared. I do have the picture however it looks just like some sort of orange fire, only one of the lights appear in the picture which is so odd because from the ground, they were much bigger, brighter and plentiful than what the camera produced. I would be so interested if anyone else in this area reported the same thing this night."],"Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Spokane","There were 2 other sightings in Spokane on or around August 9th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"08/11/2012 03:39 UTC","Case Number":"41634"}
