Lights were noticed because they were out of place in the skyline. At first it looked like Multiple helicopters. I then grabbed my video camera and could get a much clearer view. An object with 3 lights on it was seen looking west from fort lauderdale. It had 3 lights that were visible, these lights were not flashing, blinking, stroking or rotating.. 2 pink and one blue in the center. The object moved north after about 20 minutes of being COMPLETELY STILL and then quickly south out of view. About 5 minutes later another different very bright object appeared again to the west in almost the same position, it was a greenish red color. This object fell below the horizon after about 3 minutes. I have about 25 minutes of this on video. I am going to attach video frames of each object."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.128358,+-80.134649(13517)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13517) map </A>","Summary":"3 light UFO sitting still in sky, another very bright UFO minutes later","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13517.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13517_submitter_file1__vlcsnap-33359.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/13517_submitter_file2__vlcsnap-35922.png","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13517.html"],"Region":"Florida","Disposition":"IFO","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:25:00","Case Number":"13517","Latitude":"26.128358","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"11/03/2008 06:50 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-80.134649","Tags":"City","City":"Fort Lauderdale","trends":["There have been 37 other sightings in Fort Lauderdale","There were no other sightings in Fort Lauderdale on or around November 3rd 2008","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
