{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was in my back garden and I just looked upwards, I thought they were 2 stars at first but realised they were moving. These 2 object were on the same level and heading towards each other. they then crossed paths, there were no tails behind them, just 2 star looking objects. my 1st thoughts they were going to collide, but they did not and just passed each other...one of them then faded and the other came to a standstill and stayed motionless after that and just looked like a star in the sky."],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"England","Log Number":"GB-09302013-0018","Summary":"2 star like objects crossed pathed then one faded away","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51211.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51211.html"],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"51211","Latitude":"53.593091","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=53.593091,+-2.424039(51211)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51211) map </A>","Longitude":"-2.424039","City":"Bolton","Date of the Event":"09/28/2013 08:01 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:03:00","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Bolton","There were no other sightings in Bolton on or around September 28th 2013"],"Date Submitted":"09/30/2013 03:50 UTC","Country":"United Kingdom"}
