{"divs":["sighting detailsi was taking my lunch break at work. i went to my car in the parking lot and sat in the driver's seat and started to eat. it was hot, so i had the door open. i looked up an saw a blimp shaped object in the sky. i thought it might be a blimp, but it didn't seem to move. i thought, a plane? no. a helicopter? no way. it just sat there in the sky. it was extremely shiny and silver and flashed, almost as if it were spinning on an axis and reflecting the sun. it was solid. i thought it was strange that it didn't move, and was intrigued so i found a spot on my windshield to view it next to, to calculate the area in the sky and it definitely did not move. my lunch was 1\\2 hour long and it was there the whole time. i had to return to work inside the building and never saw it again. it was really weird and i told my co-workers and friends!"],"trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There was one other sighting in Los Angeles on or around August 15th 2008"],"Object Shape":"Blimp, Cigar","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24337.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24337.html"],"Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","Date of the Event":"08/15/2008 02:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07072010-0036","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.152722,+-118.442687(24337)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (24337) map </A>","City":"Los Angeles","Object Features":"None","Latitude":"34.152722","Region":"California","Summary":"Blimp shaped, silver object in sky, appeared to be flashing sunlight and stayed in same posiiton for 1/2 hour.","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"24337","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"07/07/2010 10:27 UTC","Longitude":"-118.442687","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
