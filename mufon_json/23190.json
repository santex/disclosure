I stretched my arms over my head as I looked up. I noticed the Big Dipper and an object came into my view covering the Big Dipper. I shouted at my Fiancee to look up. We saw an object moving at a fast rate of speed and move out of our line of sight over the distant tree line. The object was triangular shaped and dimly glowing a rusty-red color. As a Combat Engineering Officer, I have been trained to estimate size, distance and altitude of a wide variety of objects. I would say the object was anywhere from 100 ft to 1000 ft long depending on altitude. I had no reference point to estimate altitude. The object flew straight over our heads not making any sounds we could hear disappearing from view over a distant tree line. The time from first sighting to losing sight was about nine seconds. This statement is true and correct to the best of my abilities.
