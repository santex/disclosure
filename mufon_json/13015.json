{"Longitude":"-4.420016","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"13015","City":"Malaga","divs":["Sighting DetailsOur house looks out to sea on the Costa del Sol and is quite elevated. My daughter (15) and I were having dinner and something caught my attention through the patio door windows. I saw 3 objects moving extremely slowly upwards. We both dashed out onto the terrace to see them a bit better. There was no noise from them. We are used to seeing helicopters, military aircraft and commercial aircraft around here and therfore know generally what we are looking at. This night there was a slight haze, but could see the stars and moon easily. Each object had 3 amber lights forming a triangle. My daughter thinks that one of them has a red flashing light. They were not exactly very large, but they were the brightest and biggest lights I have eveer seen in the sky. One was slightly ahead of the other two, but they formed a vague line going from the horizon towards the atmosphere. The first one disappeared suddenly after about a minute and the second one swerved a couple of times ie. it did not go straight like the first one. Gradually the remaining two went up into the atmosphere (not across the sky) and suddenly dissaperared. This was the confusing bit, as, if they had gone across the sky I might have thought they were a weird military aircraft, but as they went straight up like rockets, this was not a usual sighting. Being a UFO sceptic, I was not frightened thinking that there must be a logical explanation the the sighting. I have been on the internet all morning trying to find out if there was a reason for this, but up to now I cannot find anything. I would take any suggestions for what this could have been. My daughter took three photos, but unfortunately have not come out very well due to movement so I won���t post them along with this report unless someone requests them."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Spain","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Malaga","There were no other sightings in Malaga on or around October 11th 2008"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.719648,+-4.420016(13015)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13015) map </A>","Log Number":"ES-10122008-0003","Date of the Event":"10/11/2008 09:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Latitude":"36.719648","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"10/11/2008 09:30 UTC","Region":"AndalucÃÂ­a","Summary":"3 objects, each with 3 lights forming a triangle","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13015.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13015.html"]}
