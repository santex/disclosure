I am living in Sicily near a town named Acireale. Looking up in a NE direction, It looked like a star was acting strange. I saw two small discs appear and move down to about 1km in a sweeping arc and accelerate towards the SW. In about a minute, a single disc appeared from the original star position and follow the same path as the first two. About 15 sec. two more appeared but moved directly south.
