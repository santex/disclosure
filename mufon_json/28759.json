the strangest thing about the whole experience is what my neighbor said as i turned to see him enter his apartment next door. i didn't see him pull up into the parking lot or open his door, but i caught a glimpse of him while he was entering his apartment. on his way inside the door, he said, \"don't look at me, they'll know what i look like!\" he was in a hurry to go inside it seemed and very fearful. i had only briefly talked with him on one occasion 2 months prior to the night of the sighting and have since moved away from the area. after looking back at the ufo which was still there hovering steady without any apparent wobbling motion, i walked to the other side of the parking lot to look at the stars in the western sky and saw what appeared to be numerous shooting stars falling straight down to earth in various directions on the horizon both west and east of my location while 5-7 lights or what looked like stars or star-sized lights that were stationary seemed to rotate clockwise and counterclockwise periodically. four of these stars seemed particulary active in localized movements. they seemed to form a isoceles trapezoidal shape in the sky with the two bottom lights. it appeared as if the bottom two lights were closer to earth than the top two. i watched the sky for about 5 minutes while i finished my cigar then turned back to my apartment. the disk was gone without any trace that it had been there. no fog remained. total event time was about 20 minutes. no evidence of anything the day after. no other witnesses observed the objects except for my neighbor and i."],"Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Fort Wayne","There were no other sightings in Fort Wayne on or around April 13th 2011"],"Date of the Event":"04/13/2011 10:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Case Number":"28759","Longitude":"-85.132881","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.084673,+-85.132881(28759)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (28759) map </A>","Region":"Indiana","Date Submitted":"04/22/2011 04:01 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"ouside apt., saw translucent lense-shaped disk hovering above parking lot with steam generated around edges"}
