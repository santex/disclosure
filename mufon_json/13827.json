{"Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"None","Summary":"Very Large extremely bright star","Log Number":"US-11192008-0018","City":"Graham","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-98.587062","Disposition":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy daughters and I were getting out of the car and we noticed three planets aligned in the sky. Then two seconds later the star on top started to move. We could not stop looking. It was as large as the 2 planets in the sky. And just as bright. We live in Graham and we see many, many airplanes flying from and to DFW. It WAS NOT an airplane. There were no red lights flashing and usually we see these. Also, we can hear the planes just after they fly by. This had no sound. For some reason I got the impression it was very high in the sky. I have seen the space station many times and it was not that either. Was it a UFO? Not sure. It was headed NE and if someone else sees something with more detail, I just wanted to say that we saw something also. I hope this helps. Please call for details. I have never reported anything before. This object was moving smoothly at a constant speed. It did not vanish;it faded from view like any object that would fly away. I cannot say enough times how brilliantly bright it was!!! Thank you."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Graham","There was one other sighting in Graham on or around November 19th 2008"],"Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"33.11411","Date of the Event":"11/19/2008 06:23 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"11/19/2008 06:23 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13827.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13827.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.11411,+-98.587062(13827)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13827) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"13827"}
