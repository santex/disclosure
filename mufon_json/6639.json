I pulled over to the side of the road to watch. It was a wing shape craft that was well over 3 city blocks wide and over a city block thick. It was floatig about 300 feet in the air and moving very,very slow toward me. There was a small craft to my left in front of it and shaped like it. There was no sound and no engines only 4 large circles with what looked like large diamonds in them on each wing and a smaller one on the nose. I have never told anyone because there was no one to tell at that time"],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"04/30/1993 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"6639","Longitude":"-105.028384","Date Submitted":"04/30/1993 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-03262007-0013","trends":[],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.98014,+-105.028384(6639)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6639) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"I was driving a !8 Wheeler down the Interstate going south when I saw it comming over the Horizion","Object Shape":"Boomerang","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/6639.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/6639.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Tags":"City"}
