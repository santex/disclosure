moving nw at about 20 mph before disappearing below the horizon... 3 witnesses...not including myself.. 3-18-2010 mesquite texas as big as the full moon initially and observed( thought ) to be so until motion was noticed over a 35 minute period moving nw... and logic kicked in that the moon does not wax and wane from top to bottom... cheshire cat smile best describes its appearance, but the darker shadow above the smile indicated a full circle obviously darker than the background sky color... complete circle... very large... observed a small, but..long wispy white cloud moving below it from left to right for a period of about 7 seconds.. appeared much like steam.. but in a straight line under the object, moving from left to right.. only once.. altitude approximated at 700 feet plus or minus , and the size was too big to cover with a thumb outstretched when it disappeared below the horizon.. initial color was what would be expected from the moon... yellow and warm.. shifting slowly to orange and then red over a 35 minute time frame.. very slow moving.. but covered approximately 5 miles over 35 minutes.. moving north west.. not always in a completely straight line. directly over i-30 e and w bound lanes and gus thompson road... moving towards nwhy and easton before disappearing behind trees and below the horizon... object definitely moved left or west before disappearing behind the trees because a light pole was between me and it and i could see when it was centered and when it was more on the left of the pole... girlfriend noticed a bright dot what she thought was a star initially upon the very first moments of observation , under the object on the left side... by the time i got out of the car passenger seat... the dot or star had disappeared.. approximately 20 seconds later... the white cloud appeared about 12 minutes later and rapidly dissipated in a few seconds after moving from left to right under the object.. we all walked as far as we could down the parking lot to watch it go to the horizon , until we were stopped by a wooden fence, which we climbed on to to look over for the last 5 to 7 minutes of the sighting... object was too big to cover with a thumb at arms length when it was furthest from us... when it was closer to us.. it was as big as the full moon... circle shape intact, but with the smile under it... not on the rt.side as the moon would appear...at this time of the cycle.. the moon also does not \"set\" in 35 minutes at 10:00 pm to 10:35 pm in dallas texas... 3 other witnesses , not including myself.. it was actually beautiful at first... thinking it was the moon... until we realized it was moving.. and logic started kicking in... that the moon does not do that.... especially with the smile underneath... not on the side.. and shifting colors... now to answer the questions... 1. in the parking lot changing a thermostat on a car.. just move to a dry parking spot to check for leaks.. 2.first noticed the object thinking it wa sa beautiful moon.. with a big cat smile.. and hugged to it thinking it was beautiful.. actually twice before we realize it wasn't the moon... 3.we thought it was the moon... but not like we had ever seen before.. because it was lit or smiling under it. 4.round, as big as the full moon, but like an eclipse where you could see the darker circle above it.. like 5\\8 darker and 3\\8 lit on bottom... yellow like what you would expect the moon to look like. at first we did not notice the movement... looking for leaks under the car and picking up tools.. job was completed...it took several minutes for it to dawn on us that it had moved from where it was .. because we went to look at it a 3rd time and it was out of sight and we had to walk to see it again.. in a very few short minutes... we thought we had lost it until we got to the wooden fence and looked over it.. and saw it again nearing the horizon line ( ie getting lower) and shifting colors to orange and them finally red very slowly smooth color shift. 5. feelings and emotions... disbelief... second guessing... what was it what did we see.. where did it go.. and then reacquired it for the final few minutes when we walked the length of the parking lot to the fence... approximately 400 to 500 yards further than where we were initially.. actions... pure observation.. amazement... discussion. comparing what we all saw ( 4 of us ) making sure we were all awake and seeing the same things... we watched it until it was no longer there... and the sky where it was lit up slightly brighter and white where it would have gone.. this lighter area lasted for several minutes until it faded away also after the object was no longer visible.. much discussion in the parking lot during and after the incident .. approximately 30 minutes or more discussing it and what to do about it.. we even retraced out steps .. where we first saw it, and walked the 400 yards again back to the fence to see if the sky was still white where it disappeared... it was not... after the sighting.... a mix of 'excitement' and 'who is gonna believe this' feeling... and how can we find out if more people saw it... it was directly over a interstate highway full of traffic in both directions moving slow for at least 5 minutes or more... 6. lost sight of the object as it got lower to the horizon and much further from us.. approximately 5 miles or so away.. we watched it go behind some trees as its shifting to red color and the smile was getting smaller and as it went behind the light post... it was centered on the light post and moved to the left of the post right before disappearing from our sight lines on top of the wooden fence... you could see the tree branches in between us and the object as it moved slightly left or west and we lost sight of it.. immediately after we lost visual... the horizon sky around where the object was lit up white .. like a baseball stadium light haze.. and this change was immediately noticed and commented on.. after we talked about it there for 10 minutes and started walking back taking about it.. we decided to go back again and double check the white in the sky to see if it was still there... and it was not.. that was 10:35 pm 3-18-2010"],"Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.769546","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in
