At about 30 minutes after the sun had completely set. I glanced Southward and then witnessed what looked like a blob or smear of several lights over the gulf of Mexico. These lights were the same color as a candle flame, perhaps just slightly more red. It looked as if the air itself was ionizing, or there was fire in the air where I was looking. I think the lights were flickering as a fire would from far away, hard to tell for sure. Lights together were about the size of a penny in hand outstretched. Shape of the lights together was like a backwards L with an apostrophe. It lasted about eight seconds then faded to nothing. I did have my camera with me, and no, unfortunately I didn't get a photo. To be honest, by the time I realized I was seeing something out of the ordinary, it was gone, and my camera was on a tripod aimed in the opposite direction."],"Case Number":"37947","Summary":"Witnessed a group of lights over the gulf of Mexico, looked like fire or air ionizing..","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Latitude":"26.144756","Date of the Event":"05/05/2012 08:30 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"05/06/2012 09:13 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Other","Log Number":"US-05062012-0005","Source":"MUFON","City":"Naples","Object Features":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.144756,+-81.79035(37947)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37947) map </A>","Region":"Florida","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37947.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37947.html"],"Longitude":"-81.79035"}
