She said it had a strange formation and I perceived it to look like a flying saucer. It's not an actual flying saucer but the clouds take the form of one that looks awfully like a ufo. If you're wondering if it is photo-edited, it's not. Just a coincidence I suppose that the clouds took that shape that time of day. It must be a sign of some sort."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/23/2010 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24395.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/24395_submitter_file1__ufosky.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24395.html"],"Log Number":"US-07102010-0005","Region":"Florida","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc","Summary":"The clouds are in the formation of a flying saucer.","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","City":"Jacksonville","trends":["There have been 66 other sightings in Jacksonville","There were no other sightings in Jacksonville on or around May 23rd 2010","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
