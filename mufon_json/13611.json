{"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like, Other","City":"Honey Grove","divs":["sighting detailsto start with, my friend, my brother, and i were have having a campout about 200 yards from my house. we were having a good time just chilling by a campfire, and talking up a storm about different stuff when we finally decided that we was going to go look for ufo's in the night sky. we had this weird feeling like we were being watched by something but we didn't know what. our campfire was right beside a little patch of woods no longer than 50 yards in width, a little thicket another words. we had a good bit of trails made in there, and thats where we headed. right when we started in one of our trails, i looked up and saw this orange like object just cruising across the nght sky. the object was going slightly faster than a jet i would say, and was going from the south direction to the north direction. i was the first one to notice the object. i quickly got my brother and my friend to look up and see the object. we were all amazed at what we were seeing. i mean to not even be searching for 2 minutes, and already seeing a ufo is spectacular in my opinion! i know this object was not a plane for a fact, because there were no blinking lights on this object what so ever! not a planet for dang sure, couldn't be a meteor at all, no way could it be a shooting star, and most certainly it wasn't the iss! we know what we seen, and this was no ifo in our books. i live about 60 miles from dallas\\ft.worth airport, so i am aware of what a plane, jet, or any type of terrestrial aircraft we have. i have seen many and i mean many planes, and there is no way this was any object was a plane. there was a few clouds out but not many so visibility was quite fair that night that we seen the object\\ufo. the object went through a small portion of a very tiny cloud that wasn't very big at all, about the size of your normal truck i would say. any ways that is how big this cloud was. we could still make out the object when it was going through the cloud. it was only going through the cloud for about 3 seconds then the object appeared again clearly to all 3 of us. just about 2 seconds after the object appeared out of the clouds, it cahnged into what looked like a star shooting across the sky. it shrunk from what looked like a quarter held at arm's length to a grain of salt held at arms lenght. very faint! then after that, the object suddenly vanished. we all just stood there in awe, as we watched this mysterical event just take place right in front of our eyes. we all agreed that what we seen was not anything that we should have in this world today that we know of. the story doesn't end there. as we were walking back, my friend said that he noticed and entity standing by our campfire. my brother and i were about 10 yards from my friend, and we were behind him when we were all walking back to our our camp. i remember him saying\"look...look!\" we ran as fast as we could to see what he was staring at, but right when we got there whatever he was seeing vanished. he described the entity to be about 2 and 1-2 feet tall, transparent looking, and he said that the entity had red eyes. he siad that that the entity was just standing there looking straight at him not moving or anything. just like a statue is what he said. he said he'll never forget those eyes how they were so red and bright, and evil looking. i believe he was not lieing, because he was pretty stunned about the whole situation that whole night. let's just say we all 3 didn't sleep in the tents that night! to conclude i don't know what we encountered that night, and what my friend encountered, but for some reason i have to believe that what we seen was a extraterrestrial object that was going somewhere but only god would know, and that what my friend seen was an alien being. it is hard to believe, but i know there is to many mysteries about ufo's and aliens that have been kep't secret for over 50 something years, and that people have a hard time trying to decide if they believe in it or not. well i do, and i say that is what we encountered that night, and that is what my friend encountered. i have reported this to www.ufosnw.com, www.ufocenter.com, and www.mufon.com. i have reported many sightins, and i will continue to do so if i continue to keep seeing these unexplained objects in the sky. thank you for your time, and i hope that you can conclude something of my report. quote: \"if we are the only one's out there, god sure did waste a awful lot of space\""],"Longitude":"-95.909968","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-11092008-0005","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13611.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13611.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.583438,+-95.909968(13611)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (13611) map </A>","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"11/01/2008 10:30 UTC","Summary":"Was a orange colored ufo, about quarter size at arm length, changed into a star-like object...","Date Submitted":"11/01/2008 10:30 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Honey Grove","There were no other sightings in Honey Grove on or around November 1st 2008"],"Object Features":"Other","Disposition":"Hoax","Latitude":"33.583438","Region":"Texas","Weather Factors":"Windy, Does Not Apply","Case Number":"13611","Sighting Duration":"00:00:08","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
