While I was sitting in the lawn chair i looked up and saw a glowing orb, it varied from red to white lights, and was similar to the one I witnessed a few months earlier. I sprung out of my chair and walked toward it. It was hard to to see from where I was sitting due to the trees. It was about 10:30-45 when I noticed there where more than just one of them. To me, it seemed as though they were dancing along the sky lines, that entire area in the sky seemed to luminate with a white light. As I continued to watch, i noticed one became brighter, It was above the moon, so i wasnt confused by the passing clouds. It was a triangular shape and was almost blinding bright then vanished. Id rather not go into detail on my feelings about this due to skeptical people associating most \"UFO witnesses\" as NUTS."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Oklahoma","Log Number":"US-07142013-0018","Object Shape":"Other","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"48942","Country":"United States","City":"Chickasha","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Chickasha","There were no other sightings in Chickasha on or around July 13th 2013"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"35.02965","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"07/14/2013 05:15 UTC","Summary":"It was though the orbs where dancing.. then suddenly vanished, moments later another one would arrive.. suddenly a hug glowing triangle shape appeared.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.02965,+-97.947082(48942)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48942) map </A>"}
