We dispatched a field operator to the site that night who reported that it looked like the entire structure( 100' L x 30' W ) was literally pulled out of the ground by something. This roof structure weighs an estimated 50,000 lbs! Damage to other items nearby was minimal or non-existant. There was no known weather event that took place that afternoon such as a tornado or microburst. A few days later I read about animal mutilations ( Horse and goats ) in the newspaper that occured that same afternoon within a few miles away."],"Summary":"Damage to a large roof structure and a horse mutilation.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17674.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17674.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"06/17/2009 05:00 UTC","Latitude":"35.548911","City":"Crown Point","Region":"New Mexico","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"17674"}
