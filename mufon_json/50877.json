It was dark outside very cloudy right after it had rained and as I looked to my left I could see an orange light in the sky coming from my left about a mile away coming toward me. As it got closer I saw there were two of them. I stopped my vehicle in the middle of the road and watched the two orange pulsating objects fly in front of me from my left to right in a straight line a little above treetop high and about 30 to 50 feet away and I would guess about 30 to 40 miles an hour (too slow for aircraft) they both glowed a pail orange and it looked like black veins pulsating inside of them, weird.... I watched them for appr. 2-5 mins. as they flew out of my sight and a car was coming so I had to get moving on the road. There were no other witnesses that I know of."],"Date Submitted":"09/17/2013 01:13 UTC","Object Features":"None","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Summary":"I was driving form morrisdaleto philipsburg, Pa on route 53 south and it was dark around 7 pm looking like it was going to rain with low dark clounds in the sky, i looked to my left and could see a orange light coming from my left in the sky .","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States"}
