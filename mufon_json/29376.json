I do remember it was close to when we could see the northern lights in the 90's. Now I have seen these triangle of stars above my grandmothers house before. I love looking at the sky and would like to think I know when somethings \"off\". So one night these triangle of \"stars\" seems closer than they ever have been before. I am not sure how long I was watching them, but out of nowhere the spun in a circle as they \"zipped\" away very fast. I would say they were a light glowing blue to a led white if you know what I mean. I haven't seen anything like it since. I am very interested in this stuff and wish the government would just come clean, we all know they know something. I wonder if Dec 21, 2012 will tie in some how with UFO's. I am watching your show now as I am trying to catch up on some school work and thought I would tell you about my sighting. Thanks for reading.
