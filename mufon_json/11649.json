The sun was down and it was close to being dark when I notice a dark object appear in the southern sky heading NNW over the Frisco Texas area. It was about 8:50 PM. The object appeared to be black or dark gray and round with no lights whatsoever. I thouth that strange since aircraft have lights flashing at this time of the evening. From the time it appeared in the sky to the time it dissapearred was about 15 seconds. I also witnessed a vapor trail of some kind just before it was gone. I thought nothing of the speed until a couple of days later when an airplane appeared and took a similar NNW path and took over 4 minutes to dissapear."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11649.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11649.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.157054,+-96.821112(11649)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11649) map </A>","Case Number":"11649","Log Number":"US-07202008-0011","Sighting Duration":"00:00:15","Object Shape":"Circle","trends":["There have been 17 other sightings in Frisco","There were no other sightings in Frisco on or around June 25th 2008"],"Date of the Event":"06/25/2008 08:50 UTC","Longitude":"-96.821112","Summary":"Witnessed UFO while lounging in my Hot tub","Latitude":"33.157054","Region":"Texas","Country":"United States","Object Features":"None"}
