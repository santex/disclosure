A flash caught my eye. As I began to watch this it was moving slightly and then I noticed it was flashing lights. But in a circular motion almost like a fair ride. Just sitting there I listened for sound and nothing so I watched it. I then began to search for answers and was coming up short. Then talks of unknown objects being spotted people on military basis commenting that their planes had been sent out ect. And then people stating \"Jupiter\" which was January 21 accurence. Then I just gazed at it - trying to make out the object. i blinked and it was gone. I spent another 10 mins searching the sky for it after it left."],"Date of the Event":"02/22/2013 01:37 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc, Flash, Star-like","Longitude":"-114.128514","Country":"Canada","Tags":"City","Log Number":"CA-02222013-0005","Latitude":"50.938603","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
