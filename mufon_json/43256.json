Pulled over at Walgreens and started video. About 20 or so orange pulsating lights flew south following each other . It looked like military craft was also around but weren't initially aware of this event and couldn't do anything about it besides set up a perimeter and track them. Approx speed of the craft about 200 mph. So not paper lanterns or flares lol. Just watch my video. This was happening on a Friday night on a busy street and it's funny how oblivious people are and how incredibly thick the denial shield is. Someone please contact me. This was a mass sighting and freaking unreal."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Log Number":"US-10142012-0028","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Sighting Duration":"00:10:00","Longitude":"-75.103098","Date Submitted":"10/14/2012 11:23 UTC","Country":"United States","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.190072,+-75.103098(43256)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43256) map </A>"}
