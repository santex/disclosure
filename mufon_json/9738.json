Noticed a chevron shape coming from the south, in the western sky. Lots of little lights on each side of the chevron, which made me notice it. Lots means maybe a dozen on the long side (west side I think) and six or more on the other side. It went straight north then I could not see it. It disappeared when it reached the northern sight line. I kept looking for it to come back as there is an airport to the west, about 3 miles, but it did not return so I know it was not an aircraft. It almost looked like a string of \"christmas lights\" - white lights by the way - floating through the sky. It was very eerie."]}
