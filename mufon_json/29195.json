I grabed my camera and I just zoomed at for a better closeup whith my Reflex camera.I was suprised by the sharpeness of the sphere. Im still not shure if my camera gave me the correct reality or it is only an illution by the lense. But when I zoomed out it was still round and bright hovering slowly. I just called my wife to take a look and when I turned to the window the object was gone. I took a HD video of the event but it is 148mb and 71mb so I cant attach the video but I took some printscreens of it."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"Canada","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.536944,+-73.510713(29195)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29195) map </A>"}
