Turned to go back into house and spotted the object moving just above treetops. It appeared to be 2-3 hundred yards from me, moving 80-100mph and straight and level. Very first impression was that it was a very low flying aircraft (well below minimum altitude)with landing light. However, there was no beam of light and movement of light would have meant that the aircraft would have to fly sideways. The light did not radiate in any direction. Was just a very distinct spherical shape and left no contrail as it disappeared behind the trees. Absolutely no sound! Spent 20+ years in USAF. Retired from Boeing. Private pilot. Definitely was not any known aircraft type.
