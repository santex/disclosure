As I was walking in a dark area noticed multiple flashing and flickering white bright lights in the sky. They would flicker in the same spot very close to each other, then disappear. The only reason it really caught my attention was because I saw two or three planes flying lower to the ground in the distance. I watched these flashing lights for about 5 minutes and started walking again as they disappeared. Then a minute later as I was still walking saw the same lights this time only 3 of them in a direction south of what I first noticed. The lights continued to flicker on and off and were then gone."],"Date Submitted":"09/11/2012 02:58 UTC"}
