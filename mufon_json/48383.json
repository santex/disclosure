Informing her about the existence of aliens. Prior to watching some science documentaries on television. After 5 minutes she faced her back towards me and I looked blanked in the beautiful clear starry sky and unknowingly just couldn't help but notice something star like fall but flashed a bright galactic radiant neon green and instantly disappeared with a metallic purple outlining it's gorgeous appearance. I suddenly turned and looked at my friend with an unbelievable jaw dropping reaction hoping she had witnessed what I did and she didn't. It being the 1st time in my existence to have had witnessed something so vast and lucid within a duration of instant seconds. Shortly right after what I saw, tiny anxiety developed prior to seeing what I saw. In an unbelievable distraught, for the reason of being the only witness to what I experienced. Personally I thought I saw a shooting star profoundly but it seemed too close and radiantly bright to have appeared far in the starry sky."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Texas"}
