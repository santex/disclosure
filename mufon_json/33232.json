So night after night I'd go out and same exact time the \"UFO\" would appear so I started looking aroud and realized that approx a mile down the road the exact object is in align with the one above my house. However the other object travels the other way. The more you watch the sky the more you realize what you glance at and believe are stars are actually other objects and I have videoed several. Last night total count actually surounding my house was approx 10. I do live on 100+ acres so area is large. I'd love for someone to come and investigate just not sure who to contact."],"City":"Tyrone","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33232.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33232.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"33232","Date Submitted":"11/09/2011 12:51 UTC","Object Features":"Dome, Patterned Surface","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-78.228694","Log Number":"US-11092011-0012","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Summary":"I observe these sightings every night of the week appears more as time go on saw about 10 last night have video","Tags":"City","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Tyrone","There were no other sightings in Tyrone on or around November 8th 2011"],"Latitude":"40.676298","Country":"United States","Region":"Pennsylvania","Date of the Event":"11/08/2011 09:30 UTC"}
