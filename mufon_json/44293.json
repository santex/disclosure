{"City":"Barneveld","divs":["sighting detailsfiery orb was in the nw sky. i was walking my dogs. it was a cloudy night with no visible stars. i was on the east side of my house when i looked north. i saw a yellow\\orange light. at first i assumed it was a planet except that it was larger than any i'd ever seen and it was a pulsating fire like ball. i watched for a few seconds from the driveway on the north side of my house and then i ran in to get my wife. when i came out i think i saw it through the trees but much lower and possibly descending. by the time i got back to the driveway it was gone. i notified the local tv station and asked if anyone else saw it. they said no. i took note of the time shortly after the event and it was 5:40 pm est. 25 years ago i saw a fiery green thing fall out of the sky in the same direction. after i reported it a man in military clothing came and had me triangulate the sighting because others in the area also witnessed it. many weeks later a small article said the air force had found a meteorite. this thing that i saw yesterday was not moving."],"Date Submitted":"12/02/2012 08:34 UTC","Latitude":"43.27021","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-12022012-0013","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Longitude":"-75.188291","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"12/01/2012 05:35 UTC","Object Shape":"Fireball","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/44293.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/44293.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.27021,+-75.188291(44293)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44293) map </A>","Region":"New York","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"stationary fiery orb","Country":"United States","Case Number":"44293","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Barneveld","There was one other sighting in Barneveld on or around December 1st 2012"],"Disposition":"Unresolved"}
