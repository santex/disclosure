{"Latitude":"27.643843","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was standing out back of my house when an aircraft that had the appearance of an airplane flew over. I was unaware of the object until I heard a peculiar sound like wind blowing above me. When I looked to see what the sound was, the aircraft was directly over me and was flying very low. It had the appearance of an airplane except that the lights were also strange. It had two solid red lights down the center of the bottom of the plane that did not flash. It did not have red and green lights like a normal plane but had white lights instead. It flew like a regular aircraft except it was so quiet that if it had not been flying so low and directly above me, I wouldn't have even noticed that it was flying by. The aircraft startled me due to its quiet nature. I had no idea that it was there then in an instance it was directly overhead and at a very low altitude. Within seconds the aircraft was too far away to be heard. I was eventually unable to see it because it was too far away and the view was blocked by the tree line."],"Object Features":"Wings","Source":"MUFON","City":"Vero Beach","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43876.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43876.html"],"Case Number":"43876","Longitude":"-80.390594","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Vero Beach","There were no other sightings in Vero Beach on or around November 9th 2012"],"Date Submitted":"11/12/2012 09:14 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.643843,+-80.390594(43876)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43876) map </A>","Log Number":"US-11122012-0020","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Summary":"An aircraft that was virtually silent with strange lights.","Date of the Event":"11/09/2012 07:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Shape":"Other","Region":"Florida"}
