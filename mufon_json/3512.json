Sky conditions were bright and very clear and the object was about 20 degrees above the horizon. The object made no noise, did not have wings and was flying slower than a plane would. It was primarily bright silver though there was also some red on it. I tried to make out details and there were some structures toward the aft end. Otherwise, it was streamline in profile, though \"stubby.\" It flew more slowly than an airplane would as viewed from a similar distance. Again, no noise was noted and it flew in a straight line, out of view after a few moments. It would be surprising if no one else saw this object. It's distance was hard to judge, but was probably on the order of a mile."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"silver and red without wings","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","City":"Woodstock","Date of the Event":"06/22/2005 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-88.448702","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3512.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3512.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Illinois","Case Number":"3512","Object Features":"Louvres, Other","Tags":"City"}
