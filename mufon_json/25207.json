He ran to the door and knocked on the door, and I got up to see what he wanted, and said \"Come out here and look at this UFO!\" and I ran as fast as I could to my room and grabed the camera and ran outside to see what he could see, but when I got out there, it was gone. About 3 or 4 minutes went by and thats when I saw the object, but this time it appeared to the Northwest of where it was previously, it brightened until it was about the brightness of Jupiter or Venus in the night sky, with me trying to get the camera set on the \"no flash\" setting since that tends to mess with night time photos. The object was stationary, and then it began to disappear and I ended up getting the camera ready as the object disappeared."],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Decker","There were no other sightings in Decker on or around August 27th 2010"],"Sighting Duration":"00:10:00"}
