I grabed my camera a took two photos of what seemed like an invisible trinagle surrounded by clouds. I did not think much of it because I went back inside and brushed it off. The time was about 3pm. Later in the year many people were reporting triangle typed ufos throughout the world and I remembered taking the photo of the invisible triangle shaped oddity. I have seen alot strange things in the sky lately but it always seems that I do not have my camera nearby."],"trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Santa Fe","There were no other sightings in Santa Fe on or around July 17th 2009","This sighting has never been favorited.",""]}
