{"Object Features":"None","divs":["Sighting DetailsMyself, my sister and her husband were traveling west on I-70( not sure of the nearest city or town we were close to, anywhere between Madison and Pittsburgh) on March the 10th 2012, heading to Wheeling West Virginia. At first my brother-in-law (driver) pointed out that he saw something to his left, directly over the tree line but when we passed, it wasn't there. We really didn't think much of it because me or my sister didn't see anything. But maybe thirty miles down the road, me being in the back seat I just happened to glance out the window to my right and just above the tree line a silvery football shape object was hovering, As we continued to travel west the object seemed as though to become reflective till I could no longer see it. After seeing the object I'm still in a state of maybe confusion, not sure of what I actually saw, and not knowing exactly how to process the sighting."],"Country":"United States","Summary":"It looked like a football shape silver in color then became transluscent","Date of the Event":"03/10/2012 12:00 UTC","Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"03/15/2012 11:58 UTC","Object Shape":"Oval","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Quarryville","This sighting has never been favorited."],"City":"Quarryville","Case Number":"36509","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Log Number":"US-03152012-0028","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/36509.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/36509.html"],"Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.853653,+-76.127315(36509)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (36509) map </A>","Latitude":"39.853653","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Longitude":"-76.127315"}
