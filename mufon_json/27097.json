I ran inside to tell my dad and came outside to find them directly overhead. I could not tell if it was a ball or disk. From underneath it was definitely lit up by an orange almost flickering light. It almost seemed like it was a round kitelike object being lit underneath by a fire. They continued to float eastward and veered towards eachother and separated. As they floated out of site I noticed a third light sitting further south that didn't seem to be moving but had the same flickering appearance. It slowly floated away. My cell doesn't have video but I got one awful picture. These things completely confused me and I still don't know what I saw but it wasnt a jet or a helicopter. Still have a rush"],"Weather Factors":"Windy, Light","Date Submitted":"12/24/2010 11:16 UTC","City":"Brownwood","Object Features":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27097.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27097.html"],"Disposition":"IFO","Case Number":"27097"}
