I was talking about the Geminid meteor shower when two students independently said they saw a UFO at the same time but in different parts of Norman. They said it was covered in blue and white lights and hovered in the same position for at least 10 minutes before they left the scene. The two girls who saw the object are not friends outside of school and neither girl knew what the other had seen before it came up in class. One girl has a picture on her cell phone, but at the current time, cannot get it off of her phone. If we can get it off the phone, we will submit it. One girl could only see lights, the other girl said she saw the lights and a dome-like feature on the top of the object."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.227967,+-97.438248(44520)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (44520) map </A>"}
