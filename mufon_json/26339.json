Sun was setting in the West and there was a low, dark cloud deck, illuminated with sunshine. There were two sets of 3 low and fast flying orbs or lights. The first three were about 25 degrees above horizon moving from East to Northwest in a triangle pattern. The second set appeared out of low cloud deck, behind the first, then proceeded to be in triangle formation following first, when it stopped. It reversed course and headed almost due East, with one light almost staying behind and stationary. I work near O'hare airport and there were planes in the sky, but these were definitely not aircraft."],"Longitude":"-88.080106","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"11/03/2010 05:08 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Illinois","Log Number":"US-11032010-0025","Summary":"Orbs & Lights Near O'hare","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","Disposition":"IFO","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26339.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26339.html"],"Date Submitted":"11/03/2010 06:55 UTC","Object Shape":"Flash, Sphere, Star-like"}
