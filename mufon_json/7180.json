{"Region":"Georgia","Weather Factors":"Unknown","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was at work when i got a call from my brother telling me to look at the sky. He lives close by my job. I looked up and saw an object moving back and forth, up and down while changing colors rapidly. It also shone a beam of red light which it appeared to be flashing to the ground. This lasted for almost two hours. I was able to take video with my cell phone video camera, I have an older model phone which cannot send video's out to e-mail but I have it saved in my phone if there is interest in viewing or any possibility of transferring the info to anyone. It was also viewed and photoed by my brother. I am including a picture but I reinterate that I do have video of it moving and changing color. It was still there when I went to bed so I have no idea how long it actually stayed there."],"trends":["There have been 7 other sightings in Roswell","There were no other sightings in Roswell on or around June 7th 2007","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"34.027395","City":"Roswell","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7180.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/7180_submitter_file1__Image0621.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7180.html"],"Object Shape":"Diamond","Log Number":"US-06082007-0003","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Case Number":"7180","Disposition":"IFO","Longitude":"-84.359973","Summary":"Bright light, Bouncing in the air, and changing colors from white to blue and back to white again, red beam sent down to the ground","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"06/07/2007 09:55 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/07/2007 09:55 UTC","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.027395,+-84.359973(7180)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7180) map </A>","Object Features":"Undisclosed"}
