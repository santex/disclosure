{"divs":["sighting detailsmy fiance and i were driving between central scotland to the tayside region, having been home to visit out parents for the weekend. whilst driving up the motorway on a clear night, we noticed 2 orange lights in the sky up ahead. i pointed them out to my other half, as i thought they were planets, as the sky was so clear, but they were very different in colour to the multitude of stars which were present. as we got closer, it became apparent that they were not planets, but were in motion, albeit, very slowly. i figured they were perhaps aircraft, or possibly small lanterns with candles which had been set off from the ground (often done over here on november 5th for guy fawkes night). as we got even closer, my other half turned to me with a very perplexed look and asked me if i had any idea what the hell they were. they were moving against the wind, at very slow speed, but were low enough in the sky to not be distant satellites\\high flying aircraft. they were also flying fairly close to one another (scale uncertain, but perhaps a few '00 metres apart). as they passed over the car, they disappeared very suddenly from view, despite the clarity of view my fiance had from the car window, which further added confusion to what we were seeing. there are no airbases round about this motorway, and the objects were very distinctive in the way they moved. the motorway also passes very close to the scottish town of bonnybridge, which is no doubt very famous amongst the members of your group (i initially perhaps thought an overactive imagination, but there's no reason my fiance would know about the reputation of this area). my fiance and i are both research academics at a top university in scotland - i do believe in the existence of ufo's, but my partner has always been highly sceptical - after this evening, she was extremely puzzled and a little frightened by what we had just witnessed. i do not necessarily want to state that i believe this to have been any form of space-craft, but the objects moved in a very unusual manner, and by their very definition, were definately \"unidentifiable\" despite the clarity of the evening sky! as i was driving, i have no photos to validate the sighting, but thought i should share my experience regardless. bizarre indeed!"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"02/21/2010 05:28 UTC","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Star-like","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=56.116984,+-3.942227(21967)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21967) map </A>","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Stirling","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Case Number":"21967","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date of the Event":"02/21/2010 08:21 UTC","Log Number":"GB-02212010-0014","Object Features":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Longitude":"-3.942227","Summary":"2x Small Orange Lights flying parallel at very slow speed - clear sky and low flying","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Country":"United Kingdom","City":"Stirling","Latitude":"56.116984","Region":"Scotland","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/21967.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/21967.html"]}
