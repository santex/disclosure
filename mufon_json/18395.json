While watching out front into the open sky view this huge white light appeared off to the southwest and seemed to hover ever so briefly, then moved off to the south at such a high rate of speed it looked like it disappeared. There was no sign of a tail and was silent. It was way to low for it to be a falling star or meteor as far as I remember. The light was solid and was about 10 - 20 times brighter than the headlights of a large plane. It was also very low in the sky. We see a fair amount of planes in our area and both my wife and I stood up and took notice right away. We have no idea what it was and are still talking about it. Not a plane or anything else we could explain."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.622815,+-88.197689(18395)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18395) map </A>","Date Submitted":"07/29/2009 09:30 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-88.197689","Latitude":"41.622815","Summary":"Huge white light appeared, very low and silent.
