I watched it as I turned in and stopped, rolled the car windows down and there was no sound at all coming from the object. It was huge. It was moving fairly slowly going slightly south east. The sky around the object was still dark (6:18 in the morning) but still bluish, the area between the 3 lights was solid black. I tried to find my phone to attempt to take a picture, but it was in my purse, when I finally found it and looked back up, the object was too far away. When I first observed it, I knew it was not a plane, the lights were of a white that was different than any light I have seen. I knew I was seeing something spectacular and was excited, yet a little scared too. I went and bought a camera to keep handy just in case I get lucky again. There was quite a bit of traffic, so I hope someone else sees this and reports also."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.497796,+-83.515934(31956)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31956) map </A>","Latitude":"42.497796","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31956.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31956.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","City":"Wixom","Region":"Michigan","Summary":"Black Triangle in sky over parking lot in Wixom MI.","Country":"United States"}
