At first, I thought they were fireflies, as I live in a rural area, but, upon closer examination, I realized that they were far too big to be fireflies and they were far more luminous than any insect I've ever seen. They kept flashing and moving at an incredible pace, and I couldn't take my eyes off of them. At first I was frightened, but then I became awash with a sense of sheer awe. The flashing lasted for about 21 minutes, and the whole time I was riveted. The objects were cigar-shaped and, from a distance, I'd estimate that they were about 7 inches long. My whole family watched as they flew around our yard. And all of the sudden, in a massive and bright flash, they disappeared."],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10367.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10367.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10367.html"],"Object Features":"Dome","Latitude":"30.630407","City":"College Station","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet"}
