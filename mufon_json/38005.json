{"Date Submitted":"05/08/2012 01:47 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was outside looking at airplanes. I was looking due west at an approaching airplane when I saw what looked like a red satellite. I have been researching satellites recently due to the fact that I have been seeing strange lights for the past 2 weeks so I know what satellites look like now. It was heading west for about 5 seconds. This part looked normal enough, but then, in a very graceful way it turned South and traveled across half sky in about 5 seconds! It was very dim and reddish. I know this was not a satellite because: 1. It turned abruptly. 2. It shot across half the sky in around 5 seconds. This makes the 3rd sighting for me in 2 weeks and 4 UFOs total!"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","City":"Hesperia","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Region":"California","Log Number":"US-05082012-0003","Object Features":"None","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Hesperia","There was one other sighting in Hesperia on or around May 7th 2012"],"Summary":"Like a satellite but absolutely not a satellite!","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"38005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.385281,+-117.307713(38005)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (38005) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/38005.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/38005.html"],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"05/07/2012 10:20 UTC","Latitude":"34.385281","Object Shape":"Star-like","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-117.307713"}
