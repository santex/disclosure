I knew planes had headlights but I didn't know that it would emit a spot light type of beam. Immediately after seeing the plane I turned right heading in a south to north direction, when I saw a bright orange light that looked as if it were flickering like it was on fire. It was descending in the same direction that I was traveling, S-N. About 10-13 seconds later it faded away. I assume that it had to have made land contact, because it was was cloudy out and dense overcast so the object must have been lower."],"Longitude":"-80.412689","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Vero Beach","There were no other sightings in Vero Beach on or around September 18th 2012"],"Object Shape":"Fireball","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42657.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42657.html"]}
