i then realized that this was something different! when i stopped at the last stop sign the clock was 9:14 pm luppini time (found only in jessup, pa). i traveled about 600 feet or so and pulled over just as anothe car passed me parking across from an inspection garage station. i got out of the car as the orange ball was descending toward the ball park's high tension power line that cut right throught the middle of the three field stadium. i could hear an electronic type crackeling (like a mosqueto zapper)uninterupted as it approached in the still quiet night. luckily a sliver opened up in the dense clouds giving me a clear view. the orange ball was heading toward the top of the high tension tower lines for sure. i was now looking straight up under the orange ball as if it was an ultra-lite aircraft. it was stepping downwardly by going forward and slightly upwardly in a floating jerking type motion out about fifty feet or so and then dropping down rappedly on a very steep slope 70 or 80 ft. or so and then stopping (similar to a mountain climber descending a very steep incline). it was aware of my presene and acted extremely cautions! i observed this repitive process for about 8 to 10 descending downward steps as it now had come down to about elevation 800' and was still descending. i rushed back into the car's back seat to retrive an old camera on the floor in a box with other materials finding the 35 mm camera and immediately tried to get a shot unable to see well enough to properly focus an set it in the dark. i missed the orange ball at its lowest point because it was now stepping back upwardly at a very steep angle as i tried to take the shot! while attempting a second shot the down pour let lose unbelievably! the clouds immediately closed the sliver type opening as i dove in the car with camera all wet. when first observed the orange ball appeared to be about 1\\2 the size of a car(2,000' elev) and then at the low point (500'elev.) it appeared to be jus about the size of a car. it was kinda of multi layered colored as follows: 1)black nose in front, 2)then dark red behind that, 3)then bright red behind that, 4)then dark orange behind that, 5)then bright orange behind that, and finally 6) extremely bright bright white light behind that! it made no noise with exeption for a crackling and moved in a slow floating type motion very cautiously. as i think it was gathering all available emfs from atop the high tension electrical power lines maybe like recharging itself! others last 4th of july (2008) reported it both before and after the comunity fire works display withh 4-5 witnesses in each group. over the past 40 years their have been numerous white blob sightings usually under elevation 200'in the upper lackawanna river basin. i felt as if it was alive as it acted like an animal being feed from your back porch steps as it was so timmed and caution and careful probably due to poor visibility and trying to avoid contact with the high tension power lines but had to recharge or maybe die! i only wish i had my binoculars as i could have really seened the details at it lowest point estimated a 400 feet. i then went down hill street to the convient mart to see if the cops were on their coffee break but! no one was to be found. i then proceede to frank's in simpson for a late snack, another area where some type of ufos seem to come and go up the lackawanna river basin toward the head waters in arart, pa their apparant area of interest when traveling through! the total time of this sighting was about 5 minutes. joseph r. caterina, pe c\\o 419 simpson street peckville, pa 18452"],"Date of the Event":"08/10/2009 12:00 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Other","Date Submitted":"08/10/2009 12:00 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08222009-0003","City":"Scranton","Country":"United States","Case Number":"18803","Latitude":"41.410849","Region":"Pennsylvania","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/18803.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/18803.html"],"Longitude":"-75.665902","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.410849,+-75.665902(18803)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (18803) map </A>"}
