It wasn't any vehicle that was human it was definately something alien. I thought it would do something but it seemd like it was just scanning the area, we are quite close to London so that's maybe the reason it came to Guildford. It was there for about 30 seconds then it went FTl back out from the atmosphere. This was my first encounter and it was frightening but amazing at the same time."],"Sighting Duration":"00:00:30","Region":"England","City":"Guildford","Object Shape":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"27865","Country":"United Kingdom","Source":"MUFON","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
