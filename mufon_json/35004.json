I thought it was maybe a strange reflection through a cloud, Lori said look at the stars there are no clouds. She thought maybe a plane on fire. We noticed it was brighter than airplane lights. It appeared to be stationary. We were watching it and trying to figure it out when it became bright white. Then it suddenly went left and right and left again very fast and disappeared as we watched. This was somewhere east of Parish dont know the distance but guess pretty far and very bright. Thats when we said we just saw a UFO."],"Longitude":"-74.2","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Log Number":"US-01202012-0009","Date Submitted":"01/20/2012 09:52 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States"}
