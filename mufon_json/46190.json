We were on or near the football field when we first saw the objects in the sky. We did not know what they were, surely not an airplane or helicopter. After a second three lights followed one another to make a line until they were out of sight. I was very intrigued and felt no fear."],"Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"39.035966","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Kansas","Case Number":"46190","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-97.586929","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.035966,+-97.586929(46190)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46190) map </A>","Date of the Event":"08/22/2012 08:00 UTC"}
