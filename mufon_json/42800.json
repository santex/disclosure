I was in a lawn chair facing west while my nephew was facing east.I noticed some movement of light behind a branch to the northwest and as the light cleared the tree I could see that it was two orbs of white blue light moving in formation from the north to south. The lead orb was at about a 45 degree angle just ahead and below the second, possibly 10-20 feet seperating them. They both looked like fuzzy balls of light that were moving faster than anything I have ever seen. I would estimate that they were possibly 5-10 feet in diameter and were 1-2 miles away. The orbs were travelling from north to south then made a steady tight arc turn due east. By this time I was pointing them out to my nephew and right when he aquired them,now travelling west to east and 75% of the way across the sky, there was a blur and then they were gone,just dissappeared. The whole sighting only lasted about 5 seconds and there was no noise. I am an aviation buff and have never seen anything in the sky that I could not explain until that night."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States","Summary":"Saw two orbs of fuzzy white/blue light that were in formation and crossed sky in 5 seconds with directional changes then disappeared"}
