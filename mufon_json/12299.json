(please read below for more!). i saw this star-like ufo traveling north west. it was extremely high up. it seemed hundreds if not thousands of feet above the atmosphere. it has no blinking lights as it looked like a star. it was traveling straight and slow and then it slowly disappeared because of the streetlight. when i saw it i was excited and had my eyes on it for most of the time and i knew it wasn't a plane and then with further observing i knew it wasn't any earth vehicle or satellite, it was one of them! this happen on august 11th, 2008 around 9:30 pm central time in saint louis. i'm a usual stargazer as i love to look at the sky and admire its beauty in our front yard. i have had ufo experiences previously and i also go outside to see if i can see any activity up in the sky. (please read below for more!). i saw this star-like ufo traveling down south. it was extremely high up. it seemed hundreds of feet above the atmosphere. it has no blinking lights as it looked like a planet. it was traveling straight and slow and then it slowly disappeared which appeared the object had cloaked. when i saw it i was excited and had my eyes on it for most of the time and i thought is that a plane and then with further observing i knew it wasn't any earth vehicle or satellite. i have had many experiences like this in the past since 2001. i have seen several like this one this year. i seen a ginormous ufo a few weeks prior which appeared to be as big as jupiter traveling north which behaved like the one i saw on the 11th. i have seen these behave different in many ways. i have seen them travel back and forth, and cloak and uncloak like a peek-a-boo or a now you see me, now you don't game. i have recently seen one that was going down east which the entire object was flashing but it was a very slow flashing characteristic. now, i have seen two that were not like these a couple years ago. these were on two separate days. they both were extremely high but had a very unusual red flashing characteristic and the one went into hyperspace or warp speed like you see in the star wars and star trek films. that was incredible to witness! i believe these red ones are man made but has alien technology. i have been wondering so long what these are and who\\what might be piloting them. it is a wonderful but creepy feeling that i get when i see these objects because i wonder are they the grays, the insectoids or something that we know absolutely nothing about or all of these different species. by seeing these ufos i know that we are not alone! if anyone has any answers and\\or has had these experiences please contact me at capri1981@aol.com with your information!"],"Case Number":"12299","Longitude":"-90.198384","Summary":"Transforming Hybrid UFO!","Object Features":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12299.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12299.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/30/2008 02:15 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Other,Unknown","Source":"MUFON","trends":["There have been 74 other sightings in St Louis","There was one other sighting in St Louis on or around August 30th 2008"],"Weather Factors":"Windy","City":"St Louis","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"08/30/2008 02:15 UTC","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09012008-0003","Region":"Missouri","Latitude":"38.631912","Disposition":"Unknown"}
