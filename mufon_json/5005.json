I looked up at the sky and noticed a light to my(right) West. At first I thought it was just a flash of light in my eyes. I blinked a few times. I followed the obeject as it moved from West to east for about 4 seconds. The lights were dim but obvious. I would estimate that it was 4 to 5 miles high(based on the dimness of the lights). The size of the object would be about the size of a pencil if held out at arms length. There was no blinking of the light and the light ran the entire length of the object. The object was blurry. My reaction was WTF???? as I watched it disapear into the glow of the City lights in the East. I live between Tinker AFB and the Oklahoma City airport and am used to seeing all types of aircraft going by, to include blimps and helicopters. This was NOT a normal aircraft."],"Object Shape":"Cigar, Other","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unresolved","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"5005","Region":"Oklahoma","Weather Factors":"None","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Moore","Longitude":"-97.483173","Tags":"City","Log Number":"US-07012006-0001","Date Submitted":"06/27/2006 10:40 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Summary":"Large craft moving West to East with solid lights (white) with red solid on top.","Date of the Event":"06/27/2006 10:40 UTC"}
