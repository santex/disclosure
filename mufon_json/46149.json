Light was very bright 3. plane 4. flew silently from S to E-NE. No doubt a UFO - there were no green or red lights on either side of very bright light, plus even after it made its turn to NE and away from me, the light remained very bright. I am quite familiar with planes 5. First I've seen that close 6. went out of sight to NE. Apparently it was climbing, because when I first saw it it was below clouds (it was partly to mostly cloudy) and then disappeared into clouds,,,"],"Region":"Florida","City":"Fort Myers","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"-81.98763","Summary":"very bright light - as brfight as airplane headlight seen head on","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Case Number":"46149","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46149.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46149.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:45","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/12/2013 06:35 UTC","Log Number":"US-03122013-0008","Date Submitted":"03/12/2013 07:02 UTC","trends":["There have been 41 other sightings in Fort Myers","There were no other sightings in Fort Myers on or around March 12th 2013"],"Latitude":"26.492371","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
