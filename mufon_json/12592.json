Object was very high and very bright, moved very fast but not as fast as a shooting star would appear. the object definately went from not moving to moving . I realized what I was seeing was not normal I, kept track of it for a few seconds and shined my flashlight in its direction primaraly for shits and giggles to see if it would stop again. It disappeared in the West sky in the clouds I felt that I had witnessed a u.f.o and felt that I should report it incase the governernment keeps tabs on this site they can note that there was a u.f.o in the area at the time."],"Date Submitted":"09/03/2008 03:22 UTC","Object Shape":"Star-like","Log Number":"US-09182008-0013","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.034024,+-73.931762(12592)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (12592) map </A>","City":"Saratoga","Region":"New York","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"00:03:10","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/12592.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/12592.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Summary":"very bright light, high, altitude, not moving, I stared at the object because it was far brighter than any star, object went from stationary to moving at high rate of speed"}
