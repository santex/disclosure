About a minute into my smoke i observed two red lights glowing in the distance comming from the south headed north. As soon as they got closer they started making a criscross pattern in the sky like they were in formation. I heard no sounds of anykind even crickets went silent. Ive always wondered if anyone had ever reported the same thing? I have also seen other objects in the past and will fill out more reports. Thanks for your time and the hard work you do!
