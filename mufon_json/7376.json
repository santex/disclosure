I looked up as the recess bell rang to go back to class and noticed 2 silver discs, flying low and fast. They disappeared over the building after about 5 seconds. Several others in Plaquemine, La. saw them, also, including my doctor with whom I had an appointment with that afternoon after school. I went to his office with my mom and he was talking about seeing the same thing. He and I discussed this sighting briefly. At that time my thoughts were that flying saucers were real, after all! I had heard of the Roswell crash and other sightings. Since then I have tried to keep up on all things pertaining to ufos. I would just like to know what the world governments are holding back from their citizens. The early 50's seemed to be a time of many sightings in the South, especially Louisiana. My father, who worked nights at a local power plant, mentioned sometime later that he had seen a circular craft of some kind with lights in the night sky while sitting outside smoking a cigarette."],"Summary":"(2) silver discs in formation, flying low, clear afternoon, very fast with no noise.","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/7376.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/7376.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc","Date of the Event":"10/24/1949 02:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
