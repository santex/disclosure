At first thought it was a dot on Tue screen but noticed dot disappeared. Return and zoomed in. Noticed that even though camera mover capturing buildings the dot did not move thru frames. Then it actually appeared lower before it disappeared from pictures. I enhanced and made negative of pictures. Object is clear. Seems small but taking the building under it as reference to window ans it is probably 3-5 feet wide."],"Latitude":"27.668587","Date of the Event":"09/18/2012 06:44 UTC","Date Submitted":"09/28/2012 11:17 UTC"}
