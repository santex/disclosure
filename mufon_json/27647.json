I got way to scared and turned my car around and took off. Then I could see in the rearview mirror that it started slowly moving again."],"Object Shape":"Triangle","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=46.213036,+-119.135624(27647)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27647) map </A>","Date of the Event":"02/03/2011 12:00 UTC","Log Number":"US-02042011-0008","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Tags":"City","Region":"Washington","Longitude":"-119.135624","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"46.213036","Case Number":"27647","City":"Kennewick","Date Submitted":"02/04/2011 01:30 UTC","Country":"United States","Disposition":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON"}
