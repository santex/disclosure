I opened my mouth to scream for mum and Dad but a sudden voice in my head said (don't be afraid I am only a friendly owl) Even though I knew it was not an owl it took the fear from me. I stared at it and it seemed to stare back. It was a round lense like eye divided in 3 on a thin stalk with a rectangular foot. The three segmented eye blinked at me as a shutter of a camera. I had become curious and got out of bed to approach it. As I approached it suddenly detached and sped back into the sky out of my site. I felt quite excited about it once it had left and ran to tell my parents. They told me I had been dreaming and to go back to bed. It was not a dream but very real."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47468.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47468.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Tags":"City","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-43.710588,+173.040219(47468)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47468) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"NZ-05172013-0014","Weather Factors":"Unknown","City":"Okains Bay","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Okains Bay","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Metallic round object on a stalk protrusion with lense like 3 segmented eye. sped down at speed and attached to wooden window frame without slowing"}
