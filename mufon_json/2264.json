I looked up to see themoon. It was about 930 and the sky was dark with a quarter moon lit up. When Ifist saw the object I thought it was somthing drifting off the trees..but thennoticed it was high in the sky. I stood transfixed watching these two craftglide softly by in the air.Two objects in the sky were spaced evenly apart. Both were Triangle in shape.Each triangle craft looked like there 3 balls all attached together to from asingle craft in the shape of a triangle. Each craft was luminus like you couldsee through them but you couldnt. Both passed directly under the moon making iteasy to see that they were not weather balloons. There was no sound as theypassed. No flashing lights could be seen and they both had a very softsilverblue glow as they glided along. During this time there was and aircraftcould be seen off to the right of them...You could see its flashing lights as itseemed to at first be moving in the same direction then went vered off to the myright from the ground. Moving quickly from the back yard through the house,grabing husband and son...the only thing left in the sky to see what the plane.Both craft had vanished."],"Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=27.667827,+-81.510004(2264)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2264) map </A>","City":"Undisclosed","Region":"Florida","Log Number":"","Date Submitted":"05/07/2003 09:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet"}
