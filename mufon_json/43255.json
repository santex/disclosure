{"divs":["Sighting DetailsI was traveling from Mississippi to Illinois going north on Route 412 near Dyersberg TN. GPS showed I was about 14 miles south of Route 155. Two saucer shaped flying objects with dome on top flew across the highway about one-eighth of a mile in front of me. It was daytime, but somewhat cloudy and dark, so the silver metallic discs were quite noticeable. They were moving very fast so sighting was short. They disappeared over the top of the tree line on my right. I felt sobered and nervous. I called the two people in this world who would believe me, my wife and my son."],"Latitude":"36.038616","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Dyersburg","There were no other sightings in Dyersburg on or around October 14th 2012"],"Date of the Event":"10/14/2012 12:00 UTC","Longitude":"-89.376008","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/43255.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/43255.html"],"Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Summary":"two saucer shaped objects with dome on top flew across highway directly in front of me while I was driving.","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.038616,+-89.376008(43255)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (43255) map </A>","Object Features":"Dome","Log Number":"US-10142012-0027","Case Number":"43255","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"10/14/2012 10:53 UTC","Region":"Tennessee","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","City":"Dyersburg","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
