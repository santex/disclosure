There was a very bad thunder storm going on. When it was over I noticed the sun came out and thought it was in the right position for a rainbow. Instead I witnessed a beautiful cloud formation like I've never seen. I started taking pictures and didn't notice anything unusual untill I downloaded them into my PC. That's when I noticed the \"UFO's\" in many different positions in and around the clouds. I became very excited and maybe a bit scared. I figured right away it was an UFO. I was snapping the pictures rather fast. Not quite burst speed but fast enough to just focus. I took pictures until the cloud dispered behind smaller cloud cover then went back home.I have shown them to a couple people and they believe as I do that it was not an airplane. So I'll leave it up to the experts. The first pic is a cut-out of the second picture. I have several more of the object in different places. Thank you!"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.54143,+-86.900582(7946)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (7946) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cigar, Circle, Oval, Sphere, Unknown","Country":"United States"}
