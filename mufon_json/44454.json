There were 6 glowing orange lights glide slowly past my window. They were all moving in a diagonal formation and were fairly close to the ground. These were not planes, helicopters, or lanterns. I've SEEN lanterns, and these were not lanterns. They were also completely silent. I really wish I could have gotten a picture but I was too mesmerized to leave and get my camera, and I was sure they'd be gone by the time I found it anyway. They were gliding Eastward."],"Date Submitted":"12/11/2012 03:04 UTC","Country":"Canada","Region":"Ontario","Summary":"Orange glowing lights","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"None"}
