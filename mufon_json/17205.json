While seated in the back of the family car, I saw what appeared to be the expected satellite approach on a west to east trajectory. It was a point of light, about the same intensity as a star but not twinkling like the stars. After a few seconds the light began to zigzag and move erratically. It made 90 degree turns without slowing. And at other times the light stopped dead. No sound was apparent. After about ten minutes, the 'craft' paused, then at speed even greater than before, it shot straight up and out of sight in less than one second."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"30.038056"}
