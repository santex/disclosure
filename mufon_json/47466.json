(as a last note i apologise if i have filled out the tickboxes confusingly, i wasn't sure if i ought to include the tall lights as \"objects\")."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=55.870212,+-4.198546(47466)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (47466) map </A>","Date Submitted":"05/17/2013 12:23 UTC","Summary":"Saw flickering object thought it was a plane, then a star till it moved around","Latitude":"55.870212","trends":["There have been 28 other sightings in Glasgow","There were no other sightings in Glasgow on or around May 17th 2013"],"Log Number":"GB-05172013-0012"}
