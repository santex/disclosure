{"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"White-orange glowing spheres, with white fog aura","divs":["Sighting DetailsAt 1 am, about 25 white-orange glowing spheres flew slowly by my window from the right side. Distance from my bedroom window was about 1000 feet. They all followed a straight path, then every sphere turned almost 90��� right (away from my house) when reaching the point, where they were right in front of me. As each sphere reached that point, it turned. No speed change, just new direction, until they were all out of sight. I guess they flew a minimum distance of over 40 miles like this. Speed was maybe 10 mph. It all lasted almost 20min. I made a video with my cam, and my wife recorded it with a photo-cam. But when I tried to replay afterwards, my video was inaccessable, it was destroyed.And, shortly after we stood in front of the window, we noticed a high pitch buzzing sound, which I heard before on a similar occasion. It was like one of those invisible disks was hovering directly over us and watching us, maybe that's how they destroyed my cam-disk. It was really loud and not comming from those spheres. I guess the invisible one was steering the spheres or controlling them, like shown in Jaime Maussans videos. The video from my wife only shows lights in the dark, it's not really good. It's a shame, my cam would have made a great video."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34239.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34239.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.36141,+9.979(34239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34239) map </A>","Object Shape":"Sphere","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Longitude":"9.979","Latitude":"48.36141","City":"Ulm","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Ulm","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Tags":"City","Case Number":"34239","Date Submitted":"12/21/2011 11:12 UTC","Country":"Germany","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"DE-12212011-0007","Date of the Event":"05/01/2010 01:05 UTC","Region":"Baden-Wurttemberg"}
