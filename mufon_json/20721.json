Coming from the north west to south east. They were silent and didn't have strobes. We see aircraft all the time,because we seem to be in a flight path and planes were flying above the lights as they pasted over us. My husband also saw the same lights last night flying side by side. They came from the opposite direction as the ones from tonight. I am really curious to know what they are. Are we being watched?"],"Date Submitted":"11/25/2009 07:57 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.35344,+-81.629413(20721)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20721) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/25/2009 06:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"West Virginia","Log Number":"US-11252009-0015","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
