They were observed at an altitude that ranged from my neighbor's rooftop (about 10 degrees) to about 30 degrees in the SSW sky from Queen Creek, AZ. I had no reference to judge distance to the objects, but with my naked eye I would guess between 3-10 miles. The orbs moved fairly slowly at times back and forth, and up and down, and would occasionally twirl around one another before returning to a back and forth or up and down movement, then after a minute or two they would drop below my view blocked by my neighbor's rooftop. Then a couple of minutes later they would rise above my neighbor's rooftop and again go through similar maneuvers. The objects were a very bright pure white light that maintained the apparent same intensity at all times they were viewed. I only viewed the objects twice between 11:00pm to 11:15pm from my patio. I looked for them several other times but never saw them again. At first I assumed the objects were fireworks from the 4th of July, or airplane landing lights; but neither fireworks nor landing lights could perform the maneuvers of the objects. At no time did I hear any type of noise coming from the objects, and there was no trailing tail of light as they moved. Also, the objects appeared to move in a straight line when they moved, then stop for a moment, and then move in a straight line in a different direction. The exception was when they would occasionally spin around one another, but even while spinning they appeared to move in a straight line."],"Date Submitted":"07/07/2011 08:03 UTC","trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Queen Creek","There were no other sightings in Queen Creek on or around July 4th 2011"],"Case Number":"30049","Disposition":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/30049.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/30049.html"]}
