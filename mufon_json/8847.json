It was a clear night with a lot of stars out. We looked up and saw a football shaped object, bright white, and bout the size of a dime, moving slowly in a straight line across the sky. There was absolutely no sound. We watched as it moved. We noticed it because it was so big and bright compared to the backdropp of stars. Bob decided to run in the house and get his camera to photograph it. When he returned, the object stopped moving and just sat motionless in the sky for a minute or two. Then, as though moving up and away from the earth, the object went from it's cuurent size to a pinpoint of nothing, and was gone. Robert never did take the picture. We thought about contacting someone about the sighting, but then decided people would think we were crazy, so we didn't. We were sure it wasn't anything from our world."],"Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Summary":"Bright, white, football shaped silent object slow. Then motionless.
