It was a large triangle with white and green lights pulsing. the object appeared to be on its side. so i walked to my back door to take a look outside and by then it was gone. i thought to myself, if it was the stealth i could hear it. since i have heard the stealth fly over many times before. there was no noise. i stood there for a moment and a helicopter flew by coming from southeast going northwest. i noticed the helicopter was much higher than the object. i have no idea what it was."],"Object Features":"Undisclosed","City":"Undisclosed","Summary":"saw an object in the sky on october 4th over lees summit","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.966253","Date Submitted":"10/05/2011 04:18 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Missouri","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.966253,+-91.826763(32374)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (32374) map </A>","trends":[],"Case Number":"32374","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Longitude":"-91.826763","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-10052011-0020","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"IFO","Date of the Event":"10/04/2011 07:45 UTC"}
