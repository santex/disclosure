Thats when I saw the ufo. out of fear I immediately put my head back into the car. Fearing that someone would think I was going crazy I never told my story, not even to my husband until around 35 years later. My question is why was I the only one to see it. If someone else would of seen the same thing it would of been in the news or newpaper, since it was early evening. Someone told me that the reason it was only sighted by me was because it was done by mental telepathy. Since then I have had another experience that is somewhat strange. I don't know what to think, but I know what I felt and saw."]}
