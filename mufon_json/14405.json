She asked me to come look at this���I looked up and saw what looked like bright stars moving from northwest to southeast across my night sky. She pointed out three of the lights in the middle of the group that were moving in a diagonal row. There were scattered clouds that night moving west to east. The lights just kept coming and coming. There had to be at least a hundred of these lights in all. They were all moving at the same speed and direction, maintaining the same distance from each other, across the night sky. The lights were slightly different in colors and brightness, some were pure white and bright, some were slightly orange-red, and some were blue-white. To us they all appeared to be at the same altitude moving swiftly, taking over a full minute to cross over our entire night sky. It was just amazing how many of them there were, and the speed they must have been going. I���ve seen many satellites in the past moving across the night sky and these lights were moving at twice the speed of them. Once the fleet had moved past us there were no more lights trailing behind. The next morning I thought about the three stars that my wife had pointed out to me when I had first joined her outside. Then it hit me, Orion, the constellation of Orion, the belt! That night I showed her the constellation of Orion in the sky; I asked her if anything looked familiar? Without hesitation she pointed to the three stars of Orion���s belt. I printed out a picture of Orion and held it up over my head, as strange as this might be, I feel that the fleet of lights was moving in the formation of the constellation Orion. Has anyone ever seen, or have there ever been any reported sightings like this?"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/14405.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/14405.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"California","Disposition":"IFO","Log Number":"US-12142008-0003","trends":["There have been 49 other sightings in Huntington Beach","There were no other sightings in Huntington Beach on or around December 12th 2008"],"Date Submitted":"12/12/2008 11:30 UTC","City":"Huntington Beach","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-117.994126","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Country":"United States","Summary":"Fleet - Nighttime - Orion?","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Case Number":"14405","Latitude":"33.662107","Date of the Event":"12/12/2008 11:30 UTC"}
