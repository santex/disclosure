{"Longitude":"-117.699444","Tags":"City","divs":["Sighting DetailsRelaxing at sunset the bright reflection of the sun off of this object caught my eye. I ran in to get my digital camera and when I got outside it was still in the same spot. I took a few pictures as I observed it start moving away slowly. It always maintained it's level upright position. after a few minutes it disappeared. No sounds, no emissions. At first I thought it could be a weather balloon or a kids balloon that got away. After looking at my pictures and zooming in on the object I don't think it's any kind of balloon. It seems like it has a hard clear transparent dome on top with a hard surface on the bottom. You can clearly see the sun reflecting off the top."],"Case Number":"41440","Region":"California","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41440.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41440_submitter_file1__Christmas2011460.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41440_submitter_file2__Christmas2011461.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41440_submitter_file3__Christmas2011462.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41440_submitter_file4__Christmas2011463.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41440_submitter_file5__Christmas2011464.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41440_submitter_file6__Christmas2011465.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41440_submitter_file7__Christmas2011466.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41440_submitter_file8__Christmas2011467.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41440.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-08052012-0005","Disposition":"Unresolved","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"03/04/2012 04:44 UTC","Object Features":"Dome","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Date Submitted":"08/05/2012 02:09 UTC","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Laguna Hills","There were no other sightings in Laguna Hills on or around March 4th 2012","This sighting has been favorited 3 times.",""],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.599722,+-117.699444(41440)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41440) map </A>","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Oval, Sphere","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","City":"Laguna Hills","Latitude":"33.599722","Summary":"At sunset hovering then moving away from my location slowly until it disapeared."}
