We heard a low flying plane. Got up from the porch to look at the plane, as the plane was flying by we were following it. I noticed a light appear out of the clouds in front of the plane. The plane veered left,it seemed to turn away from the object. We started looking at the light trying to figure out what it was. As it passed over our house, the object didnt make any type of noise. It was moving at a slow rate of speed. My wife was able to take 3 pictures of the object before it disappeared in the clouds. I have never seen anything like it before."],"Log Number":"US-04292013-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/47074.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/47074.html"],"trends":["There have been 148 other sightings in San Antonio","There was one other sighting in San Antonio on or around April 29th 2013"],"Case Number":"47074","Date of the Event":"04/29/2013 07:30 UTC","Summary":"looking at storm in sky, watching low flying plane.light appeared infront of plane.","City":"San Antonio","Object Shape":"Cylinder, Fireball","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-98.488048","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
