It was roughly 6:00pm when I noticed three lights north west that were staying still an in a large triangle formation. The light that was emitted was very overwhelming, for refrence it was as if there were 3 stars in our atmosphere. I pulled over to watch these, due to how strange in nature they were. There was no sign that they were air planes and also were way to high in the air to be helicoptors. As I sat there watching the objects, the one that appeared to be closer in distance vanished followed by the one to its right. The third light started to fade then bloomed into two lights stacked on top of each other. Then disappeared. I have never seen anything like this before, I live in the country and see lights in the sky all the time but this caught my attention there was something diffrent about these."]}
