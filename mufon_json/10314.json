(he now says he doesn't remember seeing anything and denies saying it was faster than a plane. he is in denial, but i remember vividly what it looked like.) the object was totally silent...it made no noise at all. the inside area of the triangle was very dark...emitting no light, (almost as though it absorbed it) yet the outside perimeter of the vehicle was encased in a glowing cylidrical neon green light source. the neon glow extended out away from the craft, but the light didn't reveal details as to the structure of the inner area of the triangle. did anyone else see anything like it in our area? i know that people had seen some strange things in the sky around stephenville, texas earlier in january, but the newspaper didn't describe anything like what i saw."],"Longitude":"-94.890758","Case Number":"10314","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mont Belvieu","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"01/26/2008 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
