Suddenly I saw a glowing object on the picture. It was really suprising for me, because the sky was almost clear. There were only little, white, fluffy clouds. But the object doesn't looked like them, as you can see on the picture. I actually didn't saw it really. To make sure that it isn't some defect on my lens, i made some more pictures, but the object didn't showed again. After we saw that picture, we joked \"What the aliens would be searching for in a small village like Butan??? \" :D Now seriously, I don't know what to think. I send you this picture, so you can say your opinion."],"Latitude":"43.775562","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Sighting Duration":"00:00:02","Case Number":"46737","Disposition":"Unresolved"}
