We paused for a moment because it was raining very hard, I looked towards the sky to see the rain through the parking lot lights. I didn't hear any engine noise or helicopter sound. For some reason I decided to take these 2 photos of the rain and when I viewed the photos later I saw these 2 images that shouldn't be there. I do firmly believe in other life forms outside of our planet but they wouldn't be anything we could imagine. That being said I wasn't looking for a ufo in the sky that night. If there is another explanation of these lights besides a ufo please let me know because I didn't ask to photograph this."],"Case Number":"33635","Log Number":"US-11272011-0007","Date Submitted":"11/27/2011 10:02 UTC","Latitude":"34.11357","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.11357,+-117.364104(33635)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (33635) map </A>","Date of the Event":"11/20/2011 05:38 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Rialto","There were no other sightings in Rialto on or around November 20th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Country":"United States","City":"Rialto","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/33635.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33635_submitter_file1__2011-11-2017.38.05.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/33635_submitter_file2__2011-11-2017.38.12.jpg","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/33635.html"],"Region":"California","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
