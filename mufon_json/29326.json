{"Country":"Canada","divs":["Sighting DetailsI was letting my two dogs out in the back yard , I lit a cigarette and noticed something moving in the sky.I focused in a translucent triangle with four dim blue lights . I watched it fly from south to north.I was confused that it didn't make a sound.I could see a vapor trail as I watched it fly off into the distance, it wasn't moving very fast and it wasn't flying very high.I'm always looking up at the night sky and I can see why no one else noticed the triangle, it was stealth."],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Peterborough","There were no other sightings in Peterborough on or around May 30th 2011"],"Summary":"I saw a soundless translucent triangle with four blue lights fly over my neighborhood","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29326.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29326.html"],"Case Number":"29326","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"05/30/2011 10:15 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Triangle","Log Number":"CA-05312011-0005","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-78.318396","Date Submitted":"05/31/2011 08:32 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Ontario","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.315773,+-78.318396(29326)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29326) map </A>","City":"Peterborough","Latitude":"44.315773"}
