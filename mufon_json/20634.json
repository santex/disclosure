{"divs":["Sighting DetailsDriving back into Naples from Marco Island before getting on the bridge I noticied a large star and thought to myself that is was very large. The star stayed stationary so I thought nothing of it. Then all of a sudden it got bigger in size and very bright. So much so that I thought that no star could do that. Then it dimmed to where it almost disappeared. This is now all occuring as I am still driving and going over the bridge and continuing on to Naples. As I am looking at this getting brighter and dimmer it then all of a sudden after not moving it started to move to the right looking like one light then after serval seconds of moving to the right with one light it then started blinking with several lights. This absolutly was not a plane or a heli because it was stationary for so long and was getting brighter, larger then dimmer then it turned into something else."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20634.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20634.html"],"Summary":"Star like then into something else.","Latitude":"26.148166","Date Submitted":"11/21/2009 08:27 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/20/2009 06:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Florida","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"20634","Object Shape":"Star-like","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Naples","There were no other sightings in Naples on or around November 20th 2009"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-11212009-0004","Object Features":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.148166,+-81.79032(20634)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20634) map </A>","City":"Naples","Longitude":"-81.79032"}
