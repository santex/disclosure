{"divs":["Sighting DetailsStood in Garden smoking a cigerette. Looked up at night sky and noticed stars were visable. Noticed a bright light (Brighter than all surrounding stars) moving in an easterly direction. At first thought it was a plane though no contrail was visable nor were any nav lights or such. If it were a plane it was moving far to fast to be at high altitude and would have made a noise. Only indication of altitude was when it moved out of sight above the cloud layer to the east. Reason for suspecting a UFO was the speed in which it traveled accross the sky. I have only seen satalights with the aid night vission equipment and therefore eliminated that. Brightness was constant but could not make out anything else. Too dark for my camera. Somebody else must have noticed it. I felt compelled to report it to someone. I have never whitnessed anything like it. Hope I'm not waisting anybodys time. regards."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Region":"England","Weather Factors":"None","Latitude":"51.068785","Summary":"Bright Light Moving in an Easterly Direction Med Alt Very Fast","Log Number":"GB-07042005-0005","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Case Number":"3544","Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/04/2005 10:51 UTC","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Salisbury","There were no other sightings in Salisbury on or around July 4th 2005"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3544.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3544.html"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.068785,+-1.794472(3544)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (3544) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date of the Event":"07/04/2005 10:51 UTC","Longitude":"-1.794472","Object Shape":"Star-like","Source":"MUFON","City":"Salisbury","Country":"United Kingdom"}
