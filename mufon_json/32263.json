The moon was just coming into view from my point which allowed me to see it clearly. The shape was easily discernable. Traveling at high speed and was only able to see it for about 5 seconds and I was not able to get out of the chair fast enough to follow the flight path, plus I have trees blocking the view. Several neighbors were outside during the event, but have not yet spoken with them to see if they witnessed it. As mentioned above, the UFO was ghostly in color and blended in with the sky almost like cloaking, but it did block the stars as it traveled. It is a very clear night and myself and a a couple of neighbors have fires going, but it was not smoke. It made now sound and unable to determine the altitude of the UFO, but seemed large in size from my view point."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Latitude":"28.518163","Object Shape":"Boomerang","Region":"Florida","City":"Weeki Wachee","Date Submitted":"10/01/2011 09:06 UTC","Date of the Event":"10/01/2011 08:30 UTC"}
