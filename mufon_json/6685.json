january 1977 i was 24 years old working as a carpenter's laborer during the warm months, but i was out of work for the winter of 1976 to 1977 and took a job as a security guard at wild acres lakes in dingman's ferry, pa. this was and still is a lake community. in january of 1977 there were a lot of completed homes in the area, many occupied year-round and many only on weekends by people from the ny metro area, just 60 miles or so to the east. this area was also being actively developed at the time, with a real-estate\\construction sales office at the entrance to the community, and with new lots being created from the swamps and woods, and new homes being built. part of my job as security guard was to make sure nobody was stealing the building materials from the job-sites at night, in addition to making sure nobody was breaking in to the weekend homes during the week. the night of the sighting was in january of 1977, but i can't recall exactly what date. there had been a long spell of very cold weather, and everything was frozen solid. the sighting was around 1 or 2 a.m., the temperature was probaby around zero, the air very crisp and clear, the ground had probably a foot or more of snow cover, snow was crunchy. i don't recall a moon that night, but it was clear and very starry. this area is very rural and dark at night, no streetlights or house lights where i was, but the sky to the east is lighter than the sky in the other directions because of the ny metro area 50 miles away causing light pollution. on the night of the sighting i was in the volkswagen rabbit patrol car as usual, driving around the roads of the development. at the time, during the day they were clearing a swamp with heavy equipment in one section of the development. they would bulldoze the stumps into a big heap in the middle of the cleared swamp and burn them, so at night these piles of stumps would be glowing and sending up sparks, especially if the wind kicked up. i would drive by several times during the night to make sure that sparks from the fires had not set off any brush fires in the surrounding woods. on this night i was driving south on wild acres drive toward it's intersection with windwood drive. at the time, there were no houses on the west or east side of wild acres drive on this section. there was a swamp on the left (east) side of the road, between wild acres drive and the construction road. this swamp was frozen solid and covered with snow. i was on wild acres drive, about 500 to 1000 ft or so from it's intersection with windwood drive, when i saw out of my driver's window towards the east what i thought was a fire burning on the ground on the other side of the swamp. the swamp here is about 1000 feet across, and then the ground rises up a small ridge maybe 20 feet in elevation, as i recall. the fire was on the ground towards the top of the elevation. it was clear, and i could clearly see the trees outlined against the snow and against the sky, which in the east was lighter than the rest of the sky, as explained above. i thought at the time that they might possibly be clearing a new area for development, but i hadn't been told about it, and it was in an area where there had been no clearing going on the day before. i was about 1\\4 mile away, so i took out my binoculars, a good set as i recall, but i don't recall the exact specs. i rolled down the drivers window and looked at the fire through the binoculars. i was puzzled at what i saw, because now it looked like 2 fires instead of one, but it didn't burn like a fire. the color was orange\\yellow like a fire, but it seemed to be two balls of fire one right next to the other with no space between, side by side on the ground. they burned steadily and brightly, not like a wood fire that flickers and has subtle color changes. the colors were yellow\\orange like a fire, but steady and bright. i would guess that the total width was 10 to 15 feet, and height maybe 5 or 6 feet. at a distance of a quarter mile, i could probably have blocked out the light from my naked eye with my fist on extended arm. i didn't hear any sound at all, except for the engine running in the vw. i looked at the fire through the binoculars for a minute or so, trying to figure out if it was a controlled burn or a brush fire, when suddenly i saw the dual balls of fire, still through binoculars, slowly rise straight up off the ground and through the trees until it was about 10 feet or so above the tops of the trees, and it hovered there for maybe 15 seconds or so. at this time, i was just dumbfounded, is the only way i can describe it....what the h is that? then after it hovered for about 15 seconds or so, it shot up into the sky at about an 80 degree angle from the horizon so fast that it just left a streak of yellow\\orange light in the sky, like when you wave a flashlight wand at night and you see the trail of light as you wave it. it just streaked up into the sky and disappeared. i was certain at that point that it wasn't a fire. i don't know what it was, but it certainly left an impression on me. i did not drive over to the location to examine the ground. i wish now that i had, and i can't explain why i didn't, but i didn't. i just went about my job for the rest of the night and then went home, although i did remember thinking, wow, that was different! i didn't mention it to anybody else for a long time, but i can remember it like it was yesterday. i never saw anything like it before or since. i have mentioned it to my family and a few friends, but the reaction is generally skeptical. can't say as i blame them. i have often wondered if there might have been a physical trace left on the ground...radioactive, maybe, since any ground impression would have long been gone by now. i have not been back to the area since 1977, although it's only a few miles from where i live now. if i had a geiger counter i'd be tempted to go sweep the area, if they didn't kick me out. the area surrounding wild acres lakes was then and is still very rural. to the east is the delaware river and thousands of acres of undeveloped woodland of the delaware river national recreation area, as well as stokes state forest in n.j. there are no airfields or military installations for miles in any direction. what i saw was not the landing lights or running lights of an airliner flying west from newark, n.j....i see them all the time and i know what they look like coming, going and turning. i'm 54 years old now in march of 2007. i have worked as an insurance underwriter for nationally known companies for the past 29 years. i am married, 2 children, own my own home. i served in the u.s. army for 2 years from 1972 to 1974, and was honorably discharged at the end of my service. my mos was military police, i served in the headquarters of 15th mp brigade in kaiserslautern, germany as a clerk in the plans and operations section. i had a top secret security clearance, which required a successful background investigation to obtain. here's a link to a google map of wild acres development in dingmans ferry, pa. the area where the object was on the ground is just to the east of the construction road. i was looking from the car on the other side of the blank area of the map to the west of construction road, which is a swamp, sitting on wild acres drive facing south and looking east. http:\\\\www.google.com\\maps?q=dingmans+ferry,+pa,+usa&ie=utf8&z=16&ll=41.217662,-74.940963&spn=0.00962,0.026028&om=1"],"Sighting
