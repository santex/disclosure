This is on going and has been occuring for us for the last year. Watch the skies. It starts after dark. You will see the lights moving all over the sky and never alone. We have seen up to ten at a time. They are not satellites as they come in groups and move in different patterns. Captiva Island residents keep seeing them and they are being told lies. They are very present here. Keep watching!!!"],"Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere","Log Number":"US-04272010-0011","City":"Naples","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.150956,+-81.78941(22993)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22993) map </A>","trends":["There have been 34 other sightings in Naples","There were 2 other sightings in Naples on or around March 31st 2010"],"Longitude":"-81.78941","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/27/2010 01:36 UTC","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"26.150956","Country":"United States","Region":"Florida","Source":"MUFON","Case Number":"22993","Summary":"Lights in the sky that are not satellites.
