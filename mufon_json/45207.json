The only reason it was spotted was because of a airplane flying by and lights reflected on the disc. Once spotted and plane passed it was very very hard to follow and see. This thing blended in so good to clear night sky it was eerie. we watched over the trees head east south-east in silence. I ran to our 8ft fence and climbed up watching pass. As it got overhead we could see under belly of this craft..it was spinning fast and still so hard to see.We could clearly see outline of craft but middle looked like hollow a ring see right through. The material was dull. This lasted maybe 1-2 mins not super fast and in one directional path and height. We ran to front to try and follow but once eyes were off it would be near impossible to pick up again. I could talk more but just want to see if any one else picked up. Very populated city this craft is flying over."],"trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Allen","There were no other sightings in Allen on or around January 14th 2013"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01142013-0016","Summary":"Cloaked/ Invisible Disc no noise clear night low several witness'!","Country":"United States"}
