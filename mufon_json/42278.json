Clear night with full moon. No sound. Erratic flight path, descending and then ascending. As they moved over the valley on stopped and then disappeared. After another 30 seconds or so the other ascended and did the same. Shortly after an airplane flew by in close to the same line. When objects were first noticed caught attention as they were bright and looked like they were burning. Noticed they were moving slowly and erratically. No flashing lights like an airplane. Very bright orange and pulsated(bigger and smaller)."]}
