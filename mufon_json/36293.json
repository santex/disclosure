The object was a ball of light which slowed to match our aircraft's speed and direction. When this happened all the electrical equipment in the vehicle turned off. After matching our course and speed for about 10 - 15 seconds the UFO accelerated rapidly until is disappeared from view moving slightly away from our aircraft's course by a few degree's.
