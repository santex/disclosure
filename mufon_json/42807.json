I was listening to the radio before bed, while looking out the window. I could see a VERY bright light from a little ways away. the color of the light was yellowish- whitish- orangish. but it was weird because it wasn't moving...at all. i went closer to the window and opened it up and then sat on my roof to get a better look at it. the second i got on my rood and stared at it, it quickly began to move away. it was silent as it flew. it was flashing lights like I have never seen, so bright. my eyes are still stinging from the lights. my father and i always look at info about UFO's but at first I didn't think it was one, but then it got closer. it was like a tube shape, knowing it was no plane I didn't know how else to describe it. something inside me told me it was a UFO. I was frighted and interested when i saw it. and am still frighted. I looked closer and closer, and I saw the outline of a face, and an eye, and then it flew out of my sight. I'm am a little frighted. so I contacted my father (no longer lives with me) he said to draw a picture of what I saw time and date it and to come to this sight and wright a report. and I did both. now my head hurts, I have paranoia, and my eyes hurt from the lights. I wrote this report 10 min. after I saw what I saw. the computer I am on currently has no way for me to take a photo, if I had an e-mail to send my sketch to I could send it as early as tomorrow. thank you - Rachel Allee."],"Longitude":"-105.775117","Disposition":"Unresolved","Date Submitted":"09/25/2012 01:44 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in centenial","This sighting has been favorited 1 time."],"Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42807.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42807.html"],"Case Number":"42807","Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"39.553891","Object Shape":"Cigar, Cylinder, Flash","Object Features":"Patterned Surface","Sighting Duration":"00:02:10"}
