{"City":"Italy","divs":["Sighting DetailsMy kids and I were outside stargazing when we noticed that one of the stars that appeared across the street over a tree line had begun changing colors rapidly. I grabbed my binoculars to zoom in on it and could see that indeed these were lights, stars do not have lights around them, the colors were ranging from red, blue, white, and green. Then my son noticed that there was another one to our immediate left doing the same exact thing. Again I looked and yes there were two of them. They were far off. We've had a lot of activity in the night sky that we have seen but nothing as spectacular as the light show we saw last night. We watched as they hovered and slowly made movements and then disappeared altogether."],"Longitude":"-96.884719","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10914.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10914.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Log Number":"US-05252008-0011","Object Shape":"Circle, Sphere, Star-like","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"10914","Summary":"Two hovering star like discs","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Italy","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"05/24/2008 10:12 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Tags":"City","Latitude":"32.184038","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.184038,+-96.884719(10914)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10914) map </A>","Disposition":"Hoax","Date of the Event":"05/24/2008 10:12 UTC","Country":"United States","Region":"Texas"}
