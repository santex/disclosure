I reviewed all my pictures for the last 5 years and found 15 UFOs more. I'll post them soon. I suggest everyone do the same - review your pictures. This typo of UFO pictures is not big deal to me, i saw with my own eyes much better and bigger ones, 2 times - a mass sighting in Russia are among them. And a few times i saw UFOs in USA, about 7 times... (not counting pictures).
