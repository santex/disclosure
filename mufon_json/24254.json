My brother in law and I were outside in my backyard celebrating the Fourth of July. We had just finished a yard game and sat down on the deck to take a break. We were of course looking up at the sky to see the fireworks and then noticed a strange looking object. It was an orange oval shaped object moving very slowly from southwest to northeast. We both looked at each other because we knew this was out of the ordinary. I thought it may have been a plane in trouble, but it didn't lose altitude it kept the same speed and altitude. Then as we kept looking at it a red dot came at it from above at high speed, we were completely amazed at this point. It almost looked like it was going to intercept it, but when it got close it ( red dot ) kept going in a northerly direction. The orange sphere finally flew out of sight towards the northeast leaving us scratching our heads. I'm glad my brother in law was there to see it with me so people don;t think I'm crazy."],"Object Shape":"Oval, Star-like","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24254.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24254.html"]}
