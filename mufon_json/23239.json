He was inside. The kids were playing and all of a sudden the large circlular sphere flew above us and off into the no where. It was not far above us and definetly not a plane, it was too low to the ground. The object flew right above our heads andthen it just disappeared as fast into nowhere. I will never forget this day because it was a quite Sunday afternoon and no people were around but us it was a warm day and we were outside.This was on a weekend and no one else was around. I will always remember this object because there were no reports of any rockets being shot off at Vanderburg AFB. I fully believe we saw a UFO that day. I am not exact on dates and time but it did happen."],"Longitude":"-118.60807","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05112010-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.254106,+-118.60807(23239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23239) map </A>","Summary":"Large Round Disc shaped object came across sky at a fast speed and low altitude","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23239.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23239.html"],"Date Submitted":"05/11/2010 01:52 UTC","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path"}
