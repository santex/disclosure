My home is situated where the fireworks are visible from my yard and I decided to snap some pictures of the displays. I took a total of 23 shots between 9:46pm and 9:56pm (eastern) with most of them being from the same vantage point facing south. Many of the photos contain odd lights that are not firework embers, and I���ve attributed the lights to being as yet unexploded ordinances or stars and planets that were momentarily visible through smoke and cloud. And some of the photos show ���orbs��� that I attribute to particles in the air near the camera lens (see photo #01 at 9:46). But there are blue spheres that appear in various sizes, locations and light densities (meaning level of brightness) in a few photos that I cannot explain away. They are quite bright and well defined in 2 of the photos. In photos #14 (9:49pm) & #17 (9:52pm), a blue sphere is visible that is fairly large, very distinct and surrounded by light. Enlargement of the anomalies shows a clearly 3-dimensional blue ball shaped object at the center. The anomaly appears on the immediate left edge of the firework display in photo #14 and to the right of the display in photo #17. This blue sphere does not appear in photos #15 (9:50) or #16 (9:51). Nor does it appear immediately after photo #17 in either #18 or #19 which were also shot at 9:52pm. Camera used: Olympus Camedia digital D-540Z, 3.2 megapixel During the entire 10 minutes in which I snapped pictures, I rarely looked at the scene via the naked eye. I primarily viewed the fireworks through the camera, so I did not see the blue spheres until the photos were viewed and downloaded into my computer. Perhaps they are just a trick of the camera, but I submit the photos for the viewer to decide.
