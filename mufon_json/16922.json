It beamed a very bright light, and then I passed out. The next thing I remember was that I was lying on a large white operating table thing, and this creature was standing over me. It looked kinda like that alien from predator, the movie. It put this large underwear on me, and began to conduct numerous tests on me. Then it cut me balls off (but they used anestesia, because I couldn't feel it). Then I passed out again, and when I woke up I was in my car naked. They had done a terrible thing to me."],"trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Prattville","There were no other sightings in Prattville on or around July 24th 2009"],"Region":"Alabama","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Triangle","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16922.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16922.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/24/2009 01:03 UTC","Disposition":"Hoax","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.468594,+-86.451107(16922)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16922) map </A>","Sighting Duration":"10:16:10"}
