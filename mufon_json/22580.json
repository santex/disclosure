The direction was Northwest of Box Elder MT. I didn't exactly think anything of it until I noticed that the object was changing color ranging from red,orange,blue and white. The object seemed to be dropping at a slow pace. It was around 9 o'clock at night when I first noticed it, so I called my brother whom lives across the street from me. I told him to look out and look towards northwest of Box Elder. My brother and my Mom saw the object also and both can give a similar description of what we saw. The object changed colors and also seemed rotate as it was decending downwards. This is a first for me as I never seen a UFO before, but have heard many stories around here. The whole thing took around 40 minutes to happen, the object disappeared suddenly before I can get a picture of it."],"Disposition":"IFO","City":"Havre","Object Shape":"Circle","Sighting Duration":"00:40:00","Latitude":"48.553558","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Havre","There were no other sightings in Havre on or around March 30th 2010"],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Date Submitted":"03/31/2010 04:33 UTC","Longitude":"-109.67311","Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-03312010-0009","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Country":"United States"}
