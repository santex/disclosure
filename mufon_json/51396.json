The craft was hard to make out even staring at right at it, the craft was extremely dark. We stood up and walked backwards keeping it insight for about 20 seconds then we lost sight of it. There was no Noise, No lights on the craft. Its seem sort of \"Stealthy\" to me. After that we sat back down then about 10 seconds later I spot out another Orange orb it does the same as the first one growing brighter the dimming out to where you can only make out the actual shape of the orb.
