On Tuesday afternoon, December 1 I was driving north on Highway 78 from Daleyville, Wisconsin toward Mount Horeb, Wisconsin. It was a beautiful, sunny day. The sky was blue with a few white clouds. Everything was still green at that time, as we had not yet had snow. This stretch of road is very scenic, with rolling hills and farm fields. As I was driving, I occasionally glanced out the front passenger window to my right to look at the scenery. During one of these glimpses, something in the sky caught my attention. I only saw it for an instant. My first thought was \"That's awfully low to be a plane, even a small plane.\" As I was thinking that, the object disappeared. It didn't fly off - it just disappeared. My sighting was very brief, but my impression is that it was either cigar-shaped or that it was a disc and I was looking at it edge on. It was a silvery metallic color, and very bright and shiny. The sun was shining, and appeared to reflect off of the object. I pulled over as soon as I could do so safely, within 30 seconds, to see if the object was still in the sky. It wasn't. If it had been a plane, I should still have been able to see it in the distance. The disappearance of the object was so instantaneous that I had the impression that it was \"cloaked\" or was \"dyed to match\" the color of the sky. My initial reaction was, \"What did I see?��� I can't say for sure what I saw, because the sighting was so brief. Very frustrating."],"Date Submitted":"12/23/2009 07:07 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cigar, Disc, Flash","Tags":"City","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Mt Horeb","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-12232009-0010","Case Number":"21100"}
