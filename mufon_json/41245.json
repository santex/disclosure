It slowly moved west and looked like a plane on fire. It got brighter and then dimmed out and disappeared. It was brighter than any other star. About 15 minutes later I saw another one that appeared in the same place in the sky and this one moved faster in a southerly direction. It faded out the same way as the first one."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"07/29/2012 09:56 UTC"}
