They weren't in formation, but were low, probably less than 3k feet and 1-2 miles away. Two of them were together, then after 15 seconds or so, the other joined the two and they all continued flying east out of our sight. Probably had sight of them for a total of 2-3 minutes. Couldn't hear them, but they all had 1 or 2 blinking lights on them and couldn't make out shapes. The only reason I write this is because I don't see 3 aircraft like that flying together over the city together like that. Plus, from the movement, and slower speed, I thought they were helicopters if anything, but not real sure. Curious if anyone else saw them and can straighten me out! ;)"],"Date of the Event":"12/21/2010 06:35 UTC","Country":"United States","Summary":"3 craft flying low over the city & could see only lights","Date Submitted":"12/23/2010 12:13 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-94.614731","Log Number":"US-12232010-0007"}
