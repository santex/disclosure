outside to meet a family member who was dropping off a down payment for a t-shirt order i do costume designs and i while i stood outside waiting for them to pull up i noticed a really fast object to my right darting by in the sky i thought it was odd something like a shooting star etc not sure because it shoot by so fast so it caught my attention and made me extremely alert and i immediately began to comb the night sky in search for anything strange or sudden movements etc, it wasn't alot of stars visible that night but a few none the less so as i was doing my observation another object caught my eye it appeared to be a bright star much more brighter then anything else in the night sky besides the moon is much smaller then the moon, so as i paid closer attention to that particular object which i assumed was a star i noticed it starting to flicker and make some slight movements and change colors from bright white to a darker blue then a reddish color so i was shocked and excited by my discover and i waited and watched this object about another 2 mins before for my family member pulls up and i proceeded to observe this object as i walked from my front yard where i was standing to the drive way about 10-15 feet from where i was standing in my yard i got in his car got the down payment and instructions for his t-shirt order all while keeping a close eye on this object. i was in the car talking and watching the night sky for about 3-5 mins then i departed from his vehicle and to my surprise the object which appeared to be a bright star changing colors and making slight movements up and down was still visible from my yard so i rushed into the house grabbed my video recorder and came back outside this time i approached the drive way to get a better angle and clear shoot with my camera and then proceeded to start shooting as much as i could. now at this point im outside standing in the freezing mich weather filming what i thought was a strange star and it wasnt till after i zoomed in closer on the object i was able to witness something i never seen before in my life. now this bright star had morphed from one bright light into two distinct points of light two different colors and they started to make movements like two orbs colliding and dividing separating and joining again changing patterns and growing in size. i observed the erratic activity for several mins then something else stranger began to happen the one star or orb multiplexed and grew from two points of ligt to 3 then 4 then ultimately 8 to 12 different orbs was seen at one time or another they increased in colors as the patterns and movements became more rapid and more complex in directions they all seemed to move as one unit flashing and changing colors and and going from one to several at speeds of light they would move so fast and jump out of frame and then come back into my frame even when i tried to zoom out i could only see one object that appeared to be flickering then when i zoom in again it would start to build up and make more balls of light or multiply in size and grow bigger and became more evasive in this movements it seemed precise and deliberate all tho i couldn't determine what i was actually filming it was definitely rare and unique to me i stayed and observed it for around 15 mins or so before the freezing cold forced me inside to retreat. i went inside to warm up and charge my battery and decided to go back outside after around 20 mins or so and captured similar activity in segments of 13 15 mins for a total of 40 mins to a hour the object was visible around the 4th segment of me coming back out to capture more footage it moved out the reach of my cam and i wasn't able to record anymore. im attaching a few still shoots from the actual video footage and a link to some of the video footage i i i up loading to youtube i also have more footage if your interested. let me know im curious to have a expert analyze my recording and get some answers. here is the link of some of the footage i captured that night: *(link moved to additional evidence section--cms\\sg)."]}
