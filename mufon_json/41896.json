It was approx. 9 to 10Pm. I noticed something very large moving east bound over I-70. My first thought was ...you can put a shopping mall inside this V-shaped craft! I felt is was a UFO. It moved very slowly east bound coming closer to my home. I ran accross the house to the living room deck, at which time I saw it pass over the mountain top headed east south east and it disappeared. There was not a sound coming from it. I was amazed at the size of this craft. It appeared to have a reflection on the bottom of it. I was not sure if it was from the town lights below or the lights from the craft I was seeing. It was almost like heat coming up off a highway as you look off at a distance. I was excited, yet concerned at what I had just witnessed. I only told my husband, because of the way people see you after you tell them about seeing something like this. When I saw it on TV, I showed it to my husband. The people have describe it perfectly. Now I know I was not seeing things...!"],"Object Features":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/20/2012 02:40 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"03/13/1997 12:00 UTC","City":"Edwards","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"US-08202012-0014","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41896.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41896.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"Colorado","Latitude":"39.618036"}
