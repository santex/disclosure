I got out and photographed the \"drifting\" party balloon-like object, taking a continuous series of seven photos. Within a few seconds a second similar object did the same thing, and I got eight photos this time. My wife just got out of her session, but the UFO was too small to be seen then. Within a few minutes, two fighter jets swept the area going from east to west then turning north something like the two UFOs did. I got three photos of the jets. The UFOs were similar to what dark black (very black) small party balloons might look like. Curiously, one photo in the first sequence, which should have had the UFO did not. All six of the of the others did.
