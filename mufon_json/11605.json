Anyhew, this illuminated cloud stopped forming for a second then continued and made a dot, so it appeared to stop forming again. Then, the cloud began forming again. It got as long as the top part of the \"!\" then began to swirll at the bottom. I don't know if I was just looking at a jet, many miles away and moving exactly away from my point of observance. This may not be an \"experience\", which it's totaly cool if its not, it's just unknown to me. I wish to share that I have come to believe (long before this, I once got freaked out about a green bolide I got to see and thought about contacting mufon), if we all can believe, where do we go from there."],"Object Shape":"Other","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07172008-0005","Date of the Event":"07/16/2008 08:44 UTC","Sighting Duration":"00:30:00","Date Submitted":"07/16/2008 08:44 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"11605","Tags":"City","Country":"United States","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/11605.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/11605.html"],"Region":"Texas"}
