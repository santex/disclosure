it was amazing. i know this next part sounds entirely crazy but the entire time i saw it, from begining to end, i felt drawn to watch, and or, compelled to watch this light- and not take my eyes off of it, but at the same time, i felt like it somehow knew i was watching it, even though i was millions of miles away, i felt instinctively like it knew that i personally was watching it, like it knew who i was, where it could find me, and that it could turn around at any moment and \"get me in some way\" if it wanted to, but it was in just too much of a hurry to come back right now... you will never, ever make me believe that it was- spacejunk, spacedust, spacecrap, halucionations, or whatever, because objects just don't move like that, in an apparent pattern unless something\\someone is moving it, and i do not drink alcohol nor was i on any medication that night, (or previous night!). i have had a fear of ufo's all my life, ever since i was a little kid, before i even knew what ufo's were, i don't know why, and i don't want to know why either. my husband and friends are always laughing and taking cheap shots at my belief in ufo's but, i swear i saw something that night that was unidentified and unexplainable too."],"Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-74.021804","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Other","Region":"New Jersey","Case Number":"6417","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.178447,+-74.021804(6417)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (6417) map </A>","Object Features":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 2 other sightings in Belmar","There were no other sightings in Belmar on or around June 30th 2002"],"Latitude":"40.178447"}
