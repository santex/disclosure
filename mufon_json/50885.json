{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThese are the words from my son. He said he woke up around 4am yesterday the 17th of Sept. Notice while looking out the window of his bedroom some lights hovering over the apartment across the street. It did not move much and it had lights flickering from the bottom that look like wings. The lights were red, blue, green, and the were in sets of 2 a row of three. To be more Precise it had two rows of three on each wing. The craft still had somewhat of a triangular shape with wide nose of a front end. My son also went on to say it moved on a path as though it was being control by a \"remote control\"."],"Date of the Event":"09/17/2013 04:30 UTC","Object Features":"Wings","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around September 17th 2013"],"City":"Los Angeles","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.176811,+-118.617249(50885)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (50885) map </A>","Country":"United States","Latitude":"34.176811","Case Number":"50885","Longitude":"-118.617249","Region":"California","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-09182013-0001","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Summary":"Hovering over a apt complex across the street from 4th floor balcony","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/50885.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/50885.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/18/2013 04:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"21-100 Feet","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
