Aproxamately 15 minutes later Julie pointed out a dim moving light in the eastern sky. It appeared to be a satellite(I have spent many hours at the beach and have seen hundreds of satellites). We watched the object for about 1 minute as it moved from north to south. Suddenly the object became very bright for aproxamately 2 seconds then dimmed to a lower magnitude then it origionaly was and instantly changed direction heading to the south east and sped out of sight.
