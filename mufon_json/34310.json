{"Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["sighting detailsmy girlfriend and i were on our way to visit family christmas morning. i was driving ��� she was the passenger, and we were traveling south east on route 23 through valley forge national park. as we approached the intersection near the park's visitor center, i looked up (towards the visitor center and over the outer line defense of the park) and saw a shiny, reflective, almost chrome looking object in the sky. it was spherical, maybe egg-shaped and appeared to be stationary in the sky. it looked a little like an old bubble-style helicopter fuselage...but not. i asked my girlfriend jokingly if she wanted to bet if the object was an aircraft or a ufo. we watched the object for a few seconds. i had to keep an eye on the road since i was on a curving hill coming up on an intersection, but my girlfriend was watching the object while fumbling for her camera phone. small tree tops obstructed my view for less than a second, and then the object was completely gone. i think it shot off in a north western direction, but i cannot be sure. it was there one second and completely gone the next. my girlfriend was not able to get a shot off with her camera phone before the object took off\\vanished. it should be noted that this sighting took place less than 2 miles from a lockheed martin facility."],"Tags":"City","Date of the Event":"12/25/2011 08:30 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in King of Prussia","There were no other sightings in King of Prussia on or around December 25th 2011"],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Summary":"UFO over Valley Forge National Park","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/34310.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/34310.html"],"Longitude":"-75.451952","City":"King of Prussia","Case Number":"34310","Latitude":"40.101918","Log Number":"US-12262011-0002","Date Submitted":"12/26/2011 12:49 UTC","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Egg, Sphere","Region":"Pennsylvania","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.101918,+-75.451952(34310)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (34310) map </A>"}
