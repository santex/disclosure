They pointed it out to me and I saw it. It was indeed a small glowing dot that would have looked like a star except for the fact that it was moving accross the sky in a series of very sharp turns. It could drastically change direction without changing speed at all. It was seen by at least 8 people. I didn't really have any idea wha it could be until one of the other boys joked that it was ET."]}
