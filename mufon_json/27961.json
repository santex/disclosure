We had a camcorder with us filming the beach; just having fun in the morning. Suddenly a orange sphere appear in the sky and we were able to film everything very clear. Looks like the sphere know we were filming and begin to \"play\" with us. Since that I have seen thousands of \"ufos\" videos and telling absolutely true you will never see \"something\" more clear that what we filmed that morning. The sphere move next to a balcony of a building that was next to the beach and you can see clear that was about 12 feet round. Look like that sphere was intelligent ??? no lights, no bright; just an orange sphere. Im sure that this video is very important and could be useful to your organization and ufo research.
