Initially I believed it to be a star, but it had an orange tint to it so I watched it for a while and that's when I realized it pulsated more than an average star. I went inside to get my crappy Nikon Coolpix 3200 digital camera and snapped a few photos at full zoom. When I downloaded these photos they seemed all black, so I put them on the computer and pressed Auto Adjust Color and the objects were more visible and took on a weird form."],"Summary":"Shape changing?","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","City":"Bowling Green","Object Shape":"Fireball, Star-like, Other","Date of the Event":"01/01/2008 08:30 UTC"}
