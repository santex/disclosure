IT WAS MOVING TOWARD STEPHENVILLE. LASTED FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. WE HAVE SEEN MANY THINGS IN THE SKY SINCE 1993 SO WE JUST PASSED IT OFF AS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. WE HAVE SEEN DISK WITH LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM, AND WE HAVE SEEN LIGHTS THAT ARE BIG THAT REDUCE TO SMALL AND SPEED AWAY. WE ALSO HAVE SEEN ONE CLOSE ENOUGHT TO OUR BARN ROOFTOP THAT WE WERE AMAZED IT DIDN'T TOUCH IT. FOLLOWING THIS ALL 5 OF MY MARES SLIPPED THEIR BABIES. ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE SEEN THE SAME THINGS WE HAVE SEEN, AS WE ALL STAND OUTSIDE AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, LIKE WATCHING AN AIRSHOW. THANKS"],"Country":"United States"}
