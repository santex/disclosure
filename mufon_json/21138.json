(this is why i was so stingy with the contact info above. sorry.) everything i've just described happened within a number of seconds (all these movements, all these thoughts). my heart was pounding. what if these are aliens, i thought. i got anxious and turned off all the lights. i stumbled out into the dark living room, fumbling for my digital camera i had left in my purse. i clicked it on and fumbled with my keys (still in my jeans pocked since i hadn't yet gotten out of my clothing) and stepped out, without jacket, onto the back patio. my heart was pounding. could i get a picture before they disappeared? a few had seemed to blink in and out of existence before, as i'd watched from the bedroom window. i could see these ships (or whatever they were) flying steadily and slowly southward, while continuing to periodically lackadaisically rearrange themselves amongst their pack. part hovering and part flying, it looked like. i heard no sound other than a low hum, but couldn't remember the last time i'd stood on our back patio at night in the dark. the low hum could be from machinery at the research complex just north of our property. i clicked the shutter release button, only to be dismayed that because it was so dark, the shutter stayed open a really, really long time--maybe 12 seconds. no way without a tripod could i hand-hold the camera still enough to capture what i was seeing. sure enough, upon reviewing the shot, it looked like just orange squiggles. i jacked up the iso\\sensitivity to 3200. but then the shot was, believe it or not, over exposed. the sky was actually white. and unfortunately, the shutter was still staying open so long, it was not possible to get a clear shot. in shot #1, attached below, please ignore the red and green lights in the right-hand part of the frame. those are christmas lights from the ronald mcdonald house up at campbell and allen. the *orange* lights (well, squiggles) are the objects of interest. this is a relatively new camera. i struggled to remember how to activate the video-taking capability, which i had never activated previously. i clicked the mode dial all the way to the end and, sure enough, that was where \"video\" is located. i mashed the shutter release button, hoping that would start recording. the display was a little ambiguous. i couldn't tell if i was recording or not. and then the ships\\lights\\whatever disappeared. they didnt' seem to \"fly away\" but rather just vanish. i was cold and went back inside. i spent a few minutes flossing my teeth and looked out the window again. darkness. and then another wave of the orange lights\\ships appeared. moving again in the same floating\\advancing loose formation. i went back to the living room, got my camera again and tried again with stills and video but it just seemed i wasn't getting anything. (playing both the videos on my computer just now, i see they each last only a few seconds and are just pitch black. worthless.) i tried to tell myself it was just military aircraft and nothing to be excited over, or fearful about. at this point, having searched the web today with the search string \"tucson ufo sighting 2009\" and seeing nothing any more recent than dec. 1 (which didn't match my orange lights anyhow), i am feeling pretty despondent. am i the only person (over age five) who noticed anything in the night sky over tucson last night? please e-mail me. thank you. mkm"],"Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.225393,+-110.923279(21138)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21138) map </A>","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Region":"Arizona","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Summary":"6 - 8 orange pairs of lights hovering/flying in sky in non-strict formation","Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"12/24/2009 11:45 UTC","Log Number":"US-12252009-0024","Longitude":"-110.923279","City":"Tucson","Latitude":"32.225393"}
