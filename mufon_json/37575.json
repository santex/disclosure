First, for 2 seconds just one UFO was present and it moved a bit lower and suddenly disappeared.Then a second UFO of the same colour and size appeared a few meters right to the previous one and it hovered straight where the previous one was. It moved at incredible speed, following a semi-circle direction and then it looked as if it was absorbed. They both disappeared. The event occured for appr. 1 minute. It's the bright unusal colour that made us notice the objects. Once I saw them I insisted that they were UFO's. I felt a bit shocked and scared because once we noticed the objects, I yelled that they looked like they were UFO's and pointed at them and immidiately the first disappeared. We lost sight of the objects as they disappeared."],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"04/18/2012 04:10 UTC","Object Features":"None","Log Number":"CY-04182012-0016","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37575.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37575.html"],"Region":"Larnaca","Disposition":"Unresolved","Case Number":"37575","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.922137,+33.637083(37575)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (37575) map </A>"}
