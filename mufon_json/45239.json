{"Summary":"hovered over local dump bright light's","Sighting Duration":"01:00:00","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn 1-15-2013. I was getting myself a drink for the night. When our neighbors kid came in the house talking about seeing strange lights across the field near our local dump. He described them like flares. I even said you're seeing flares. But he described the lights to be yellow and orange. We then proceeded outside to observe the lights he was seeing. To my astonishment. I see these lights hovering in the area just across the street. The mother than reported the object to have lifted a vehicle and disappear. According the neighbors there were 3 objects in the beginning and what was still being seen was one object almost close to the ground before completely disappearing. Before the object disappeared myself & the neighbors kid went as close as we could by the dump to get a Better look but was unsuccessful. I then reported this sighting to local police but was redirected to MUFON."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.835269,+-111.754088(45239)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45239) map </A>","Date Submitted":"01/16/2013 12:41 UTC","trends":["There have been 35 other sightings in Casa Grande","There were 4 other sightings in Casa Grande on or around January 15th 2013"],"Object Shape":"Cylinder","Region":"Arizona","Country":"United States","Case Number":"45239","Source":"MUFON","Latitude":"32.835269","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Casa Grande","Longitude":"-111.754088","Log Number":"US-01162013-0005","Date of the Event":"01/15/2013 09:30 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45239.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45239.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Features":"Unknown"}
