It was hovering at an obtuse angle without the points . It was moving in a curved line pattern. It lasted for only a few minutes, less than 5. When we went inside for lunch, it was still moving very slowly. It could have only been two things, a plane called the super hornet or a UFO. As we went inside, that was the last that I saw."]}
