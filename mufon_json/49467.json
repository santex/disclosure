I saw what I took for a bright star, until I noticed that it was moving far slower than a meteor, but far faster than an airplane. It continued in this speed and direction until it disappeared over the horizon. Aircraft must fly within the atmosphere which constraints their appearant altitude above the horizon. an aircraft at 45degrees can be no more then 10 miles from the observer. that distance is too close for it to appear as a point of light. In addition aircraft have blinking lights excepting only when they are traveling directly toward the observer. Spacecraft, including satellites must move ballistically except for the few seconds after liftoff. No spacecraft can reflect sunlight when it is the shadow of earth as was the location of this light. It occurs to me that far more sightings such as this may occur than are reported because most observers are simply not sophisticated enough recognize or discern inexplicable behavior."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/49467.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/49467.html"],"Date of the Event":"07/29/2013 09:40 UTC","Case Number":"49467","trends":["There have been 68 other sightings in Pensacola","There were no other sightings in Pensacola on or around July 29th 2013"],"Summary":"very bright light moving non- ballistic and constantly with any known air or space craft","Date Submitted":"08/04/2013 10:09 UTC","Source":"MUFON"}
