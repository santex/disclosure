It was very foggy and I could see it going in and out of the fog, a few hundred feet up in the air. To be honest it could have been an aircraft from Moody Air Force base, but it looked pretty weird. I've lived here my whole life, about 15 minutes from the base and haven't seen anything like this. As it approached I came to a stop in the middle of the road, trying to see more of it. It passed over my car and zig zagged slowly into the opposite direction. I hesitated and thought about following it but didn't. It was moving slow enough that I felt like I might be able to follow it. I thought it could have been a helicopter but it was silent and had too many lights, on 4 corners. I wish I could describe it further but I don't remember the details. It happened really fast and I didn't have a good look with it passing over."],"City":"Hahira","Longitude":"-83.372658","Date Submitted":"11/30/2009 11:27 UTC","Region":"Georgia","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Fog","Latitude":"30.991306","Object Shape":"Diamond","Case Number":"20819","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.991306,+-83.372658(20819)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20819) map </A>","Summary":"Diamond shaped, slow moving, blinking, parallel with road."}
