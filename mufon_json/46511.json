I was standing outside waiting on my husband to come out and looked up into the sky. At first I thought it might have been a military formation because the two objects were very close in tandem with each other, they were less than a thousand yards apart going across the sky. I thought it was kind of a little too tight a formation for even a military one, and I know commercial jets would not be flying in such a tight formation. As my husband joined me, I asked him to look at the two objects because I thought it kind of unusual. Right about then the rear of the two objects broke off the chase and made a sharp left hand turn away from the other object heading west. As we passed through town heading back toward our house the object had a sharp reversal and was headed back east. I did not see if the object went back to his chase."],"Sighting Duration":"00:05:00","Object Shape":"Cigar","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","City":"Cassville","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"two long dark objects emitting a jet like contrail","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.677011,+-93.868811(46511)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46511) map </A>","Date Submitted":"03/31/2013 08:55 UTC","Case Number":"46511"}
