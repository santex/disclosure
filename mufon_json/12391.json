(i was actively trying to \"debunk\" what i was seeing as it was happening) i also have seen a \"green fireball\" years before that zoomed over my house at roughly 50 to 100 feet. there is the possibility it was a meteor, but seeing as it was so close to the ground and yet still roughly the size of an rv, it seems there would've been an impact somewhere close that would be reported. since then, i have watched the skies for any other signs of things i couldn't explain, and on the night in question; it definitely paid off!
