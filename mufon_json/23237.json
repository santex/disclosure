{"Case Number":"23237","Country":"United States","Source":"MUFON","divs":["Sighting DetailsI went outside last night to let my dogs out. When I opened the door, my attention was brought to the sky where a white round flashy orb was radiating light. As it moved northeast, it turned red and then green and took off. I stared at the sky for about 20 minutes and then saw another white light cross over. The second object didn't take off as fast as the first, but I know it was not an airplane or helicopter. There was no sound."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Summary":"Colored flashes in the sky.","City":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23237.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23237.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-05112010-0005","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Region":"Wisconsin","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-88.782968","Latitude":"43.78585","trends":[],"Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"05/10/2010 09:30 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Sphere","Date Submitted":"05/11/2010 10:57 UTC","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.78585,+-88.782968(23237)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23237) map </A>"}
