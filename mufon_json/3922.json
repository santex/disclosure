I then noticed a red object in the west (over my house) and the object was heading in a general northern pattern...At first I thought it was a plane but as I watched it, I noticed no other color lights and I didn't hear a sound...It remained in my sight for over 30 seconds because my attention was diverted to a \"shooting star\" that was very bright and also traveled in the same direction...By the time I looked back for the original object, it was gone..."],"trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Meridianville","There were no other sightings in Meridianville on or around September 30th 2005"],"Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-09302005-0002","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/3922.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/3922.html"],"Case Number":"3922","Latitude":"34.853258","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Summary":"Outside in driveway of house when I noticed a red light in the western sky moving towards the north...Didn't see any other lights and no sound.","Disposition":"Unknown"}
