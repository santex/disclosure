It moved to the west and passed out of our view. It returned about thirty seconds later still flickering and flying in a very erratic pattern. We tried to pass it off as a loose kite, or a high flying bird. It began flying towards us then and we realized that it was very high up in the sky as it flew behind a cloud never to be seen again."],"Disposition":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 20 other sightings in Saginaw","There were no other sightings in Saginaw on or around April 30th 2011"],"Object Shape":"Star-like","Case Number":"28885","Date Submitted":"05/01/2011 01:54 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/30/2011 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Summary":"Flickering, erratic, \"star-like\" object.","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-83.947447","Latitude":"43.424","Log Number":"US-05012011-0003","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/28885.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/28885.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed"}
