{"Country":"United States","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","divs":["Sighting DetailsThis is from my wife who would like me to report it. She was watching tv when she noticed three orange lights to the north west of our home. They weren't blinking but seemed to be moving both south and towards the house. She got up and went to the window to get a better look. Thinking they might be a helocopter that would soon be moving over the house, she went outside to the drive way to get a better look. When she got outside, the lights had moved up and away at a fast rate of speed and went from orange balls to white lights. They continued to move up and away travelling east and south from our home. No sound was ever heard from the objects."],"Object Shape":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"08/02/2012 09:20 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Case Number":"41399","Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Date Submitted":"08/03/2012 09:50 UTC","Longitude":"-122.239678","City":"Auburn","trends":["There have been 12 other sightings in Auburn","There were no other sightings in Auburn on or around August 2nd 2012"],"Region":"Washington","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unresolved","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41399.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/41399.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41399.html"],"Latitude":"47.320693","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=47.320693,+-122.239678(41399)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41399) map </A>","Summary":"Orange lights that accelerated up.","Log Number":"US-08032012-0022"}
