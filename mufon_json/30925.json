There had been a sighting approximately 7 miles away and had been cordoned off. AS we were driving, I felt soothing strange. I was in the back seat and looked up through the back window when I saw an object in the sky. It appeared to be hovering above us and following us. The other 3 people saw the same object. We were afraid and the driver floored the car to return back to school.
