She was talking to her mother on the phone when I noticed something flash in the sky. I looked up and saw what I thought was an extremely bright star. It then proceeded to move across the sky in a straight line toward the north(from the south). As it got closer to the city, it veered to the north east. I live close to an airport and a military base is about 40 miles away. I know for a fact this is no helicopter, plane, or government craft, at least that is made public. I was able to record this sighting and will gladly send a copy of this to you. It is dark and the object is clearly visible. I used the home in front of mine for reference."]}
