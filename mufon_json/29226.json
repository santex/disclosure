I was working in the railyard at North Kansas City when one of my coworkers called my attention to a bright light in the sky to the west. Soon, one of my other coworkers saw it too. Then we noticed at total of three of these objects. Two of them seemed closer and brighter than the third. I would say about the size of a penny on the two and an asprin on the third. We looked at them for a few minutes...then decided to look again and they were gone. This was in broad daylight with a few puffy white clouds floating by. The objects looked to be chrome or silver metalic like in color. They did not move when I looked at them, but the guy who first noticed them said one moved quickly in a strait line and stopped. Two of the dots where close together and another was farther to the north. I would say they were visible for about 5 minutes maybe."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Region":"Missouri","Longitude":"-94.562177","City":"North Kansas City","Log Number":"US-05232011-0013","Summary":"Three Disks in Bright Dayllight","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Latitude":"39.130004","Case Number":"29226","Date of the Event":"05/21/2011 12:30 UTC","Tags":"City","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Date Submitted":"05/23/2011 08:37 UTC","Object Shape":"Disc","trends":["There has been one other sighting in North Kansas City","There were no other sightings in North Kansas City on or around May 21st 2011"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29226.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29226.html"]}
