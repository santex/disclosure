{"Longitude":"-85.25736","divs":["Sighting DetailsWe where setting on the edge of a corn field looking ease over a meadow calling coyotes. clear night half moon. I heard a fizzle,pop crackle, and saw a very whit intense light flash over us. As if a flash bulb had gone off. The light did not light up area, just bright white in my eyes. The other two people with me reacted in wonderment to this. as we looked to see what had happened, high in the sky to the east south east we saw a wide long glowing space . This was not a object, more like a trail. It was uniform from end to end and took up perhaps 20% of the sky . As I watched it I could see sparkles in the glowing. and it uniformly faded out. Not end to end or top to bottom. the thing just faded out. It lasted perhaps. 20 seconds. I have seen the norther lights on many occasions and do not believe that is what I saw this night."],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25954.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25954.html"],"Log Number":"US-10182010-0008","City":"Charlevoix","Summary":"heard pop and crackle blinding white flash long wide glow with sparkles fades in 20 seconds.","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/18/2010 10:46 UTC","Latitude":"45.323153","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Michigan","Disposition":"Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Case Number":"25954","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Charlevoix","There were no other sightings in Charlevoix on or around October 16th 2010"],"Viewing Distance":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=45.323153,+-85.25736(25954)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25954) map </A>","Object Shape":"Other","Object Flight Path":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"10/16/2010 10:30 UTC"}
