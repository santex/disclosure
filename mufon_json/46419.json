I was looking at the beautiful cold night sky full moon with streak of clouds. Then I sudden saw redflashing craft flying alittle above clouds. First I observed the craft as plane but it had no wings only a saucer shape with top and bottom hump. The object just flew closely above clouds in the bright full moon night. Straight NE direction to Nova Scotia or canada. I thought I was crazy seeing an real saucer with shock feeling that its real after all. I could see windows clearly and flying in a normal speed until it passed into the hidden clouds. It was big like as an jet plane. There was no doubt it was an flying saucer. I decided to report my story later since watching some programs about the MUFON. I thought this is a supernatural incident becz i never saw one so real and clear. Thanks for hearing my story."],"Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46419.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46419.html"],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Chelsea","This sighting has never been favorited."]}
