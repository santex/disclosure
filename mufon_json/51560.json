A bright star caught my attention and I looked up. But then i noticed something else. It looked like a somewhat brightly colored parachute that also twinkled with all sorts of colors. And it hovered and descended just like a parachute. It was very intriguing. I couldn't take my eyes off it. But then I noticed another object to the right. I would have to say that they were identical and they both were hovering and descending at the same rate. I thought about stopping the car to take a few pictures, but I'm sure the pictures would just show a couple dots of light. Because they seemed to be very far away and my phone camera is not what you would call state of the art. So I drove on and soon they were behind me as the road turned. But I haven't stop thinking about what I had just saw. So I found your website and decided to report it. I'm sure I'm not the only one to lay eyes on these objects, whatever they may be, and I bet there are a lot of other folks out there wondering about them."],"Object Shape":"Other","Latitude":"39.735263","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.735263,+-74.998787(51560)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (51560) map </A>","Date Submitted":"10/14/2013 10:01 UTC"}
