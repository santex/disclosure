{"divs":["Sighting DetailsOrange lighted glowing, t-shaped objects appeared from the western sky and moved with no clear path to the northeast as they disappeared from sight. They did not move in a straight line rather slowly darting in an apparent path to the northeast. These nine objects caught both my eye and that of my wife, Esther. They did not appear all at once, more like one or two at a time. They had a weird orange glow. They were not planes, large or small. They could have been helicopters but I don't think so. Helicopters that I have observed in the past did not move or have the appearance that these objects had. This observance lasted no more than ten minutes. It was an odd experience which has left a question mark in my thoughts as well as that of my wife."],"trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Walnut Creek","There were no other sightings in Walnut Creek on or around April 24th 2011"],"Log Number":"US-08052011-0001","Region":"California","City":"Walnut Creek","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Case Number":"29038","Summary":"Orange lights, t-shaped objects appeared from the western sky","Longitude":"-122.056353","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.911413,+-122.056353(29038)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (29038) map </A>","Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Cross, Sphere, Unknown","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29038.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29038.html"],"Date Submitted":"08/05/2011 12:13 UTC","Date of the Event":"04/24/2011 09:20 UTC","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Latitude":"37.911413"}
