As we watched, the light, a soft bright yellow point, moved at an angle towards us then turned slowly toward the east. The distance was between 5-15 miles away. I noticed that it was speeding up and said \"its speeding up!\", by the time I had finished speaking it had sped up and disappeared into the distance. It was kinda like star trek enterprise going into warp but without leaving a trail like on TV, it just went. (I have since replaced the dead batteries that were in my camera.)"],"Source":"MUFON","Longitude":"-83.514902","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/24620.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/24620.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Log Number":"US-07182010-0012","Latitude":"36.28092","Country":"United States","Case Number":"24620","City":"Rutledge","Object Shape":"Star-like","Region":"Tennessee","Disposition":"Unknown","Summary":"Slow light moving across sky.","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/18/2010 01:13 UTC","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Rutledge","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Date of the Event":"07/10/2010 10:15 UTC","Tags":"City"}
