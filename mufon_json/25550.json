{"divs":["Sighting DetailsThis was seen over the gulf from the Lock & Key resturant in Manasota Key,FL. It looked like a ball of fire in a hot air ballon, although the people that I was with that night said they don't fly hot air ballons at night for lack of proper night landing gear. It was there for several minutes just floating around very quietly and then just was gone, only to reappear a few minutes later. This was very strange to see so I took a quick video on my Blackberry although the quality is poor. I recently moved here this past june & I must say this is not the first time I can mention a sighting. I know of people close to me that have witnessed events from my native Long Island,NY."],"Case Number":"25550","City":"Manasota Key","trends":["There have been no other sightings in Manasota Key","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Date Submitted":"09/25/2010 12:41 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Longitude":"-82.35204","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Object Shape":"Circle, Fireball, Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/25550.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/25550.html"],"Object Features":"None","Tags":"City","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"09/11/2010 09:30 UTC","Region":"Florida","Latitude":"26.92534","Log Number":"US-09252010-0002","Source":"MUFON","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.92534,+-82.35204(25550)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (25550) map </A>","Summary":"Manasota Key,FL"}
