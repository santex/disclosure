{"Country":"United States","divs":["Sighting DetailsAGAIN, the same thing I have seen for months . I set up my camera on my deck ( clear view to the west of Salt Lake Valley) and captured an object that appears out of nowhere . It hovers , glows changes colors. then moves straight up, side to side and heads north. Another object appears a few minutes later and same thing happens . I changed the video timing to make it faster . My original video is 25 minutes long . I am so glad other people are noticing this over our valley."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.690569,+-111.787931(52036)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (52036) map </A>","Disposition":"Unresolved","Summary":"Red object hovers and moves erratically","Latitude":"40.690569","Region":"Utah","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-11042013-0018","Longitude":"-111.787931","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"52036","trends":["There have been 73 other sightings in Salt Lake City","There were 2 other sightings in Salt Lake City on or around November 3rd 2013"],"City":"Salt Lake City","Object Features":"None","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/52036.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/52036.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"11/04/2013 03:43 UTC","Date of the Event":"11/03/2013 08:03 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Shape":"Circle, Flash, Sphere, Star-like, Unknown"}
