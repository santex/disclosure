The picture was downloaded and saved to a hard drive. Recently while reorganizing many of the pictures I viewed this one and noted a single dark colored orb or disk with a blue aura around it. The object seemed to be at some distance away perhaps over a thousand ft maybe more at approximately a 40 deg angle. Its dimensions are unknown but appears to be fairly small in diameter maybe ~6 ft. Since this is a discovery based upon a photo it is unknown what direction or altitude it came from or changed to. I'm Very Certain It was not dirt on the lens or a bird or other normal aerial object. It is similar in shape and color to other objects posted as UFO's. It is being reported now as a record for the data base."]}
