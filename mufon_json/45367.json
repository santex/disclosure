When we got outside we observed the lights moving in an easterly direction. They were in triangle formation for the most part with a few others around them. They were a kind of reddish orange color and moved slowly across the sky. We could see alot of them but in the direction they were going they would be out of sight soon so I walked down the street. I continued to observe the objects until I was almost at the end of the street when one of them zoomed out of sight. And then they were gone. It is the most amazing thing Ive ever seen. I cant think of anything else that it could have been. Airplanes and helicopters do not move as silently and swiftly as these did."],"Object Shape":"Sphere","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45367.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45367.html"],"Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Object Features":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-01222013-0006","City":"Paintsville","Date of the Event":"01/22/2013 07:45 UTC","Summary":"there was a large number of lights in triangle formation moving slowly east and then i saw one of them zip across the sky and they were gone","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Paintsville","There were no other sightings in Paintsville on or around January 22nd 2013"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Region":"Kentucky"}
