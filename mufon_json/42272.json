Very strange for being on top of a mountain. The smoke wouldnt move. Strange noises in the forest out back but this wasnt bothersome. We thought nothing of it. I looked over at the other witness when i saw this star like thing floating in the sky. We talked about what was happening and described back and forth what eachother was seeing. I had made a phone call to a friend durring this time. There was no interferance. The light faded and all of a sudden moved west. Its lights dim began blinking in colors of airplane lights. Almost like a camoflauge. it continued straight until dissapearing."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.469773,+-123.523574(42272)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (42272) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/42272.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/42272.html"],"Object Features":"Patterned Surface","City":"Victoria","trends":["There have been 14 other sightings in Victoria","There were no other sightings in Victoria on or around September 2nd 2012"]}
