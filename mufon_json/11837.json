The would gradually appear and slowly fade out. One right after the other. Once there were 6 lights that appeared simultaneously one right after the other. I was sitting on my back patio having a cigarette and noticed the lights appearing. I held my fist up to see how close they were to the horizen in the western sky and it was exactly one fist. I watched and after they were no longer visible then 3 minutes later they would appear again. Sometimes it took as long as 20 minutes for them to come back on. I know there is a meteor shower going on the last few days and this definitely was not a meteor. I was excited to see the lights come on the way they did and I am positively sure it was not an aircraft. I yelled for my son and my boyfriend to come and see the lights. They saw them as well."],"City":"Twin Falls","Region":"Idaho","trends":["There have been 9 other sightings in Twin Falls","There were no other sightings in Twin Falls on or around July 30th 2008"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","Object Features":"Unknown","Log Number":"US-07312008-0004","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Sphere","Summary":"bright golden lights appeared and disappeared in same spot seemed to hover in the same area","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.562967,+-114.460871(11837)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (11837) map </A>"}
