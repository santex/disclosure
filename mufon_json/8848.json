No alcohol involved. Sky was clear, no wind. at approx 0100 hrs my friend said, \"whats that\" and pointed to the NE. What I saw was a cylinder looking object, rather large but diff to say how big as I did not know what altitude it was at. There were no lights at all and the object made no sound. It flew in a nose to tail way as an airplane would with no wings. It went from the NE toward the SE. It flew in a straight path and appeared to be moving ratehr fast. We watched it until we lost sight of it. San Jose international airport is just west of where I first noted object but the airport does not allow landings after 0000 hrs. It flew across what would have been the normal approach path to the airport. i immediatly knew what I saw was not any aircraft I had ever seen before."],"Case Number":"8848","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/8848.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/8848.html"],"Log Number":"US-01142008-0011","Date of the Event":"10/10/2006 01:00 UTC","Longitude":"-121.890346","Summary":"flew across sky, no lights, silent","City":"San Jose","Latitude":"37.347826","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.347826,+-121.890346(8848)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (8848) map </A>","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 106 other sightings in San Jose","There were no other sightings in San Jose on or around October 10th 2006"]}
