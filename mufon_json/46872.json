Got our mom who was speechless when she saw ufo. She called police. Next day 2 men slight build strangely identical looking, one had lt grey suit, other black. Insisted we did not see anything though our mom told them we did. UFO stayed under 500 ft, felt like it was watching us As soon as we moved into the street from our lawn the UFO followed us to the street in a sharp fast totally silent maneuver, and would position it self directly above us. When our mom observed the UFO it stayed in position until my mom told us to get inside , then the UFO ascended in a westerly direction so fast I don't believe that technology is from any earthly source."],"Country":"United States","Latitude":"40.794464","Case Number":"46872","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Shape":"Disc","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.794464,+-73.363677(46872)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (46872) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/46872.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/46872.html"],"Source":"MUFON","Date of the Event":"04/27/1965 07:45 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown"}
