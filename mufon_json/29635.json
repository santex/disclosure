There was no sound or other lights. It then faded out.It was moveing slowly, but it travel about four times the distance I figured it would move on its course. I watched for a few minutes , when it appear much farther north then move on and faded out again. No sound no other colors and it was much brighter then any thing else in the sky.This takes place at my home. I'm not sure what it was, but I've been around airplanes all my life. It didn't act like a plane."]}
