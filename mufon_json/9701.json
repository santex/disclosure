Last night i was in the upstairs bathroom and i looked out the window up at the moon thats when i noticed a large star object in the western sky. It was flying as low as 500FT and was flying towards the east fairly fast. what was weird while observing this object the bright white light suddenly just turned off then the object started to glow red! Then it hit me right away that conventional aircrafts aren't allowed to turn their lights off so this was something other worldly. I watched this object for about four minutes. I noticed that someone on the site has sighted a ufo similar to this one. That's amazing there is something definitely strange out there."],"Source":"MUFON","Country":"United States","Region":"Iowa","Object Shape":"Star-like","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Longitude":"-93.599766","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed"}
