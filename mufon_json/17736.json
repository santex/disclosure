I looked up at the clouds as the cloud structures were pretty interesting and noticed what I thought was a plane. As I kept looking at it I began to think it was an interesting looking plane. What was strange was that it was extremely shiny and all silver in color. I could not make out any wings, tail, or trail behind the object. The shape was circular. It was high and moving from west to east. I lost sight of it once it entered a cloud. The sky was clear when I saw it and I was able to see it for about 2 minutes."],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Circle","Summary":"Silver, shiny, circular.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.160081,+-77.4392(17736)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (17736) map </A>","City":"Penfield","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-06302009-0006","Object Features":"Dome","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/17736.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/17736.html"],"Region":"New York","Case Number":"17736","Longitude":"-77.4392","Country":"United States","Date of the Event":"06/29/2009 08:30 UTC","Date Submitted":"06/29/2009 08:30 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"43.160081","Source":"MUFON"}
