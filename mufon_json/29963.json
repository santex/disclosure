During the fireworks display (maybe 30-40 minutes into it), we suddenly noticed a orange glowing object appear and rise slowly to the height where the fireworks were bursting. Then, it slowly came out towards us to approximately the center of the river before ascending off into the sky and getting much smaller in appearance, almost resembling a star, but with a orange to red sparkle & emission of light around it. It appeared to go back and forth slightly only moving a little. Approximately 10 minutes later, during the grande finale, something caught our eye off to our right, and it was another orange glowing object but seemed closer yet smaller than the first one. Within seconds, while our son was getting the camera phone out of the truck, we looked for it again, and it was gone, but the other still remained high in the sky."],"Date of the Event":"07/04/2011 10:40 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Augusta","There were no other sightings in Augusta on or around July 4th 2011"],"Object Features":"None","Log Number":"US-07052011-0015","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/29963.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/29963.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"07/05/2011 02:57 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Latitude":"38.74839","Tags":"City","Summary":"orange glow shape in the sky during fireworks event","Disposition":"IFO"}
