I happened to catch movement at about 20 degrees through my front windshield. I looked and saw a huge cigar shape object traveling rapidly across the sky. This object was much larger that a plane and seemed to be a very bright and shiny white. I screamed at my son to look and he looked up and saw it too. I was on my home street but continued past my house trying to keep it in sight. It was traveling faster than anything I had seen before and was traveling low enough that it disapeared from our view as it traveled behind trees. We were both blown away by what we saw and agreed that it was definitely like nothing we had ever seen!"],"trends":["There has been one other sighting in Henderson","There were no other sightings in Henderson on or around January 14th 2013"],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.836154,+-87.590013(45200)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45200) map </A>","Summary":"I was headed home with my 21 year old son and saw the ufo out the car window.
