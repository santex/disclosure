I pointed it out to my family and we all stood and watched it move slowly from South to North (we were facing West). It was moving horizontally, neither ascending or descending, and we could not hear any noise from it. After about 2 minutes it paused for about 30 seconds, and then it appeared to be moving to the West and eventually flew out of sight. Our best description of the 'object' is that it was glowing with a sort of a fuzzy halo around it. There appeared to be 4 spiky legs protruding from the bottom."]}
