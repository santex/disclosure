Drove slightly less than a mile before I was able to take video of two orbs.","Longitude":"-72.6441","Object Shape":"Fireball","Case Number":"45092","divs":["Sighting DetailsAfter turning onto East Street in Easthampton, MA from Route 5, I noticed what at first I thought to be a very strange-looking streetlight on the I-91 overpass as I began to pass under it. As I drove between the two overpasses, I looked upward to see a large fireball above my vehicle that seemed to be slowly drifting to the northeast. It made no noise. I slowed my rate of speed to watch but with traffic behind me, I was unable to stop and watch. I continued driving for a little less than a mile until I was able to pull onto Fort Hill Road in Easthampton. I looked to the northeast and witnessed two glowing orbs in the sky. As I took video on my cell phone, one of the orbs flickered and disappeared. One orb remained. Shortly after, another orb appeared below the remaining orb and appeared to ascend. I have communicated with another witness who seems to have had a better vantage point than I, and may have additional information."],"Region":"Massachusetts","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"01/05/2013 09:30 UTC","City":"Easthampton","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Latitude":"42.271438","Country":"United States","Log Number":"US-01082013-0005","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 4 other sightings in Easthampton","There were no other sightings in Easthampton on or around January 5th 2013"],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45092.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45092.html"],"Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.271438,+-72.6441(45092)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45092) map </A>"}
