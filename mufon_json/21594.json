It was almost as bright as if someone were shining a flashlight directly into your eyes. I had to stop at a red light about 30 seconds after I first saw it and watched it for about 2 mins before I kept moving. It did not move the entire time I sat at the light and then all of a sudden, as I drove just past it, I watched it plummet straight down almost like a shooting star but directly towards the ground. I immediately stuck my head out the window and listened for a crash but never heard one. I couldn't tell how far out it was from the road or how to begin looking for it so I kept driving home. I have never been so terrified by something that I could not explain in my life. I had no idea what I saw but I'm not crazy and I'm not a liar and I know I saw something. I can't really explain my exact feelings about it right after other than fear and disbelief."],"Date Submitted":"01/23/2010 04:28 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Other","Disposition":"Insufficient Data"}
