{"Log Number":"US-02092013-0003","divs":["Sighting DetailsI am being visited every nite by these beings......they are translucent and somewhat transparent, but in the darkness I can see them coming thru my bedroom, thru a portal I guess. They walk into my living room and sit on my furniture and floor. They disrupt my electronics..ie: phone and computer. Since I have recently started trying to get help with all of this, I have contacted a few sightings places, but no one has returned a phone call. Don't know if they are blocking my phone calls TOO. I see them and they are now being hostile toward me, because I'm seeking help. I do feel that my life is at risk and would like help proving there existence in my life.........I ask that you look on the internet at the \"morgan city monster\". That is exactly what one or more of these beings looks like. I am being very sincere and I have much more to share with you people, but getting help seems to be harder that I thought."],"Latitude":"31.648431","Summary":"beings entering my apartment","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"20 Feet or Less","Country":"United States","City":"Nacogdoches","Date of the Event":"12/01/2012 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Region":"Texas","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Other","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/45636.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/45636.html"],"Case Number":"45636","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"N/A","Object Shape":"Other","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=31.648431,+-94.635941(45636)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (45636) map </A>","Longitude":"-94.635941","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","trends":["There have been 3 other sightings in Nacogdoches","There were no other sightings in Nacogdoches on or around December 1st 2012"],"Date Submitted":"02/09/2013 11:48 UTC"}
