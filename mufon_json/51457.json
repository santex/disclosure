It was a very dark but very clear night about 9 PM. Finally I saw something almost exactly what we saw on TV. A huge dark black object with dimly lit rectangular windows. Looked like a very slow moving house with no roof. It made no sound whatsoever & couldn't see any objects in the windows. It was very slowly moving from north to south about 60 feet above the highway we were on. Now at least I know we're not the only ones who have seen a similar object of this kind. No telling how many others have seen a similar object but haven't reported it to anyone. I have no idea if anyone else saw it that night as we continued on our way home to Stillhouse Resivor close to Harker Heights, Texas. Thanks to MUFON's efforts of making it known to the public there are unexplained objects everywhere. Kinda wish I could see it again & be ready to take live video of it to pass on to MUFON."],"Object Features":"Window(s)","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/51457.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/51457.html"],"Sighting Duration":"00:02:00","Region":"Texas"}
