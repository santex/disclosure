I stared at it as much a i could while driving, noticing it was not moving at all. At first i thought it was a commercial airline, but realized it wasnt moving, left no contrail, and was huge. I alternated between watching the object and the road, and after a minute and a half it wasnt there when i looked back up. I then turned north to try and locate it but there were no aircraft or other objects in the sky. The sky was clear and sunny."],"Sighting Duration":"00:01:30","Region":"Colorado","Longitude":"-102.268116","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"04/17/2006 12:45 UTC","Object Shape":"Unknown","Summary":"Large shiney silver elongated object bigger than commercial airliner near powerstation","Latitude":"39.310078","Weather Factors":"Does Not Apply","Date of the Event":"04/17/2006 12:45 UTC","Disposition":"Unknown","Case Number":"4691","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/4691.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/4691.html"]}
