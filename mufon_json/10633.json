AWAKE AT 2AM. THERE WAS A SOUND LIKE A LARGE EXPLOSION SUBDUED BY DISTANCE, AFTER APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES AT 2.22AM I LOOKED OUT OF WINDOW AND EVENTUALY BECAME AWARE OF AN OVERLY BRIGHT STAR. IT WAS A LARGE WHITE STATIONARY STAR-LIKE LIGHT. A HELICOPTER OR AIRPLANE WAS CROSSING THE SAME PART OF THE SKY BUT MUCH CLOSER TO EARTH, I WATCHED TO SEE THE LIGHT MORE CLEARLY WHEN THE CRAFT PASSED (IN A TYPICAL FLIGHT PATTERN) AND AS IT DID PASS THE LIGHT BECAME MUCH BRIGHTER AND THEN SEEMED TO RETREAT VERTICALLY AT HIGH SPEED BECOMING INVISIBLE. I THOUGHT ABOUT THE EVENT THIS MORNING AND CONSIDERED THAT THE LIGHT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN METROLOGICAL, A STAR OR PLANET."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/10633.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/mufon_json/10633.json","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/10633.html"],"Latitude":"51.757394","Source":"MUFON","Date Submitted":"05/02/2008 02:22 UTC","Log Number":"GB-05022008-0002","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United Kingdom","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Tags":"City","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.757394,+-1.252845(10633)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (10633) map </A>","Case Number":"10633","Region":"England","Longitude":"-1.252845","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Object Shape":"Disc, Flash, Star-like","City":"Oxford","Date of the Event":"05/02/2008 02:22 UTC","Summary":"LARGE WHITE STATIONARY STAR-LIKE LIGHT THAT RETREATED VERTICALLY AT HIGH SPEED"}
