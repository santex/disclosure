{"Date Submitted":"10/14/1960 12:00 UTC","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","divs":["Sighting DetailsWhile attending Wichita High School Southeast,(1960) I, Donald Molzen, and Mike Greshiam belonged to NASA (as a volunteers). We tracked satellite launches from Cape Canaveral. On an evening in the winter of 1960 a lady named, Barbra Battie,(part of our team)sighted an object, which was also verified in Australia that same night. This object was seen for several nights around the world. It was called Batties Moon by Nasa. I doubt if you will find any documentation on this. We documented the sighting and NASA confirmed it. This object from the magnitude of brilliance and orbit was believed to be 3 miles in diameter. That���s a big object to come and go? My wife, Joy, and I saw strange lights in the Socorro NM. area a few years ago, knowing that it was NOT a normal occurrence. Joy and a friend (a high school football coach) observed an U.F.O traveling from north to south over the N.E. Heights in Albuquerque, N. M. around 1 A.M. in the late 1990s. Joy, being formerly a Fighter Pilot���s wife and an A.F. brat of a pilot, had grown up around planes Etc. She and her friend both saw what they saw, but had no desire to report their sighting. Joy states there was no way for her to judge the altitude or size of the object,(it was not at a low altitude) that it appeared to be three large, bright lights lined up across as though in formation, or it could have been one large object with three lights. She pointed the traveling lights out and she and her companion had absolutely no desire to discuss or report what they had seen (due to being rather freaked out and what would they say and to whom?) Her attitude is that she saw what she saw, accepts that it was not anything that could be explained, but neither she nor her friend felt a need to try and report it. After watching Larry King this evening, we thought maybe you would appreciate our stories.
