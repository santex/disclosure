At about 1000pm I went out side to have a smoke, as I was smokeing my cigarette I got a strange fealing and looked up over my shoulder and what I saw was incredible. The UFO was like nothing Ive ever seen before. It was all black about 150 long, 30wide, and 2 to 3 stories high. It was about 100 to 150, above the ground and did not make a sound. The speed of the craft was about 30 to 40 mph at my best guess. When I 1st saw it I thought, how could it fly with no wings or tail section, It was a rectangle. FinallyThe UFO slowley moved accross the sky until I could see it no more. Thank You Joe."],"Object Shape":"Square, Rectagular","Summary":"UFO saw close up","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.895967,+-78.868669(2462)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (2462) map </A>","Region":"New York","Log Number":""}
