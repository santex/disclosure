(sorry, no pics--i didn't have a camera at hand.) you guys are the experts, and i am sure that if it is something normal you have already seen it enough times to have figured that out. i would appreciate you letting me know. feel free to contact me via e-mail as i am harder to catch by phone. and my heartfelt thanks for the work you do!"],"Summary":"Bright white cigar shaped object moving steadily across the sky","Log Number":"US-02142011-0001","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.18987,+-83.430674(27805)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (27805) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/27805.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/27805.html"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 8 other sightings in Morehead","There were no other sightings in Morehead on or around February 11th 2011"],"Source":"MUFON","Disposition":"Unknown","Date of the Event":"02/11/2011 12:00 UTC","Case Number":"27805","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","Tags":"City","Longitude":"-83.430674","Country":"United States"}
