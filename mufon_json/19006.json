As usual it was a clear morning and i could see everything in the sky. I was looking at the moon and noticed 3 bright stars, one on the right, left, and bottom of the moon. As i was watching they all started to move in all different directions one after another. Like you see in movies they started off slow and then went so fast they were gone in a few seconds. I couldn't believe what i saw i was very scared and could not believe what i just witnesed. It's been about 20 years and I have never forgot it."],"trends":["There have been 21 other sightings in Springfield","There were no other sightings in Springfield on or around September 1st 1985"],"City":"Springfield","Object Shape":"Star-like","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.104463,+-72.580481(19006)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (19006) map </A>","Summary":"Three UFOs around moon.","Case Number":"19006","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-72.580481","Date of the Event":"09/01/1985 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/19006.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/19006.html"],"Log Number":"US-09012009-0010"}
