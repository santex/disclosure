I'm sorry in advance if this wastes anyone's time. --- It was two days before my brothers 10th birthday. My parents had taken him to El Paso to shop for gifts. I stayed with my Grandparents. I was 12. My grandma was sick so I spent a lot of time outside. I rode my bike everywhere. On this particular day I had eaten breakfast and headed out on my bike to \"explore\", my favorite pastime. I headed up to the foothills to follow gullies and rabbit trails, look for coyote tracks, whatever. I had been out awhile. I remember thinking I was getting hungry and it was getting late in the morning. I should get home for lunch. My intention was to go back down the wash, the way I had come, but decided to climb the bank and see if there might be a shorter route. I climbed to the top of the bank and that's when I saw it. It rose from behind the hill to my right. I would guess I was about a quarter mile from the hill. I remember thinking initially it was a giant balloon, it rose slowly like a balloon would, but it was the oscillation that bewildered me. It moved like a decelerating quarter that had been spun on a table, As the quarter slows it does that weird warped wobble, that was the movement this thing exhibited. It was a good size, it was disc shaped, no humps no bumps, nothing, it was non-descript and brown like paper bag or cardboard box brown. It rose, stayed stationary for a bit. It moved left about 3 lengths, then back right, then straight up. I watched it until it disappeared. As it headed up, it rose slowly at first and then got faster. I have no idea how long I watched it. I put down 5 min but it could have been a couple minutes either way. I got a little scared, climbed back down and got home fast. My father was working at Holoman AFB on the high speed test track. He had taken me to several air shows and we spent a lot of time looking at planes and stuff. I told him about it later and he said it was probably nothing, so I just kind of blew it off. I always wondered what it was. I've never seen anything like it since. I hesitate to even report this. It seems so silly but maybe someone else has seen this thing. Who knows, maybe my encounter will add credence to another���s."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"08/26/1978 11:00 UTC","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Alamogordo","There were no other sightings in Alamogordo on or around August 26th 1978"],"Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Tags":"City","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/13428.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/13428.html"],"Object Features":"None","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","Longitude":"-105.957865","Country":"United States","Object Shape":"Disc","Case Number":"13428","Summary":"Generic light brown oscillating disc.
