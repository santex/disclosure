Across the valley from me is a tract of land about 200 acres that no one lives on. My picture window overlooks the valley and this tract of land. Oct.1, 2006 I was watching TV and the picture window is off to my left. When it is dark, you can't see out the window and can only see the reflection of the interior of the house, mainly my dining room where my computer is. I kept seeing a flash out of the corner of my eye while watching TV. I saw it four times and the last one was very bright. I thought it must be something on the computer flashing, so I turned it off and went to bed. Oct. 2, 2006 My morning routine is to get up and drink coffee and sit in the dark in the living room. As I was sitting there the next morning there was a big flash outside the window. It scared the hell out of me and I don't scare easily. It looked like someone was standing just outside of the window, taking pictures with a flash! It lit up my whole living room! I could not see out the window as it was real dark and there are no lights out there anywhere. About a minute later, it flashed again. So I got my flashlight and started shining it out the window and could see nothing. It flashed again. So I sat there for a couple hours watching it flash about every minute or two. It was a very metallic white light, extremely bright and seems to rotate. It finally started getting light and I could then determine it was across the valley at the base of the hill opposite me. There is nothing there but brush. I continued to see it until sunrise and then it stopped. I wanted to go over there to see what it was, but I am not on good standing with the property owner and he has it posted with no trespassing signs. So that night I decide if it starts again I will sneak over after dark to see what it is. Just before dark it flashes again. So I put on some dark clothes to go check it out. As I am getting ready, I see it flash again. When I am ready, I go outside and stand where I can see it. It flashes and I start counting to see if I can estimate when it will flash again. I count to 65 and it flashes. So I decide to count one more time and go for it. It never flashes again. I sat and watched out my window all evening and not once did it flash. Oct. 3, 2006 I get up and there it is again. It flashes four times about a minute apart and then it stopped and flashed again in about 15 minutes. Then that was it. Two years go by. Sept. 25, 2008 My daughter spends the night with me on Wednesday nights and then we get up real early and I drive her to school, a 45 minute drive. It is completely dark at 6:15 when we leave. The sky was clear and there was a sliver of a crescent moon in the east. When we were about 5 miles from home, we saw a streak of light to the west of us in the sky. It was very bright and moved with the speed of a meteor, however I have never seen one with such a thick trail and there was sparkles in the trail. But then it stopped and flashed. It was the same metallic rotating flash I saw two years ago! It stopped, rotated as it flashed and I saw an afterglow underneath a cigar shaped object that went back opposite the direction it was originally moving and then the afterglow went around the end of it started around the opposite side and then it went black. My daughter saw it before I did. The next day I asked her to describe what she saw and she pretty much saw the same as I did. Sept. 26, 2008 I was sitting outside in the dark. I was sitting where I could see the ���spot��� where I saw the flashing light two years ago. A car was going by and I saw a flash. I thought maybe it was a reflection off a sign from the headlights, but my attention was now on the ���spot���. A minute later, I saw the intense flash at the exact spot from two years ago! It was back! I ran in and got my daughter and brought her out. We both watched the spot. I was beginning to think it was not going to flash again, but after about three minutes it flashed! I finally had a witness. I had my daughter go back in the house and I went down to investigate. I walked down to the road and waited for a half hour and saw nothing. I went back up to the house but sat outside where I could see the flash if it came again. It never did. A year goes by. I decide if it ever comes back, I will not confront it because it always disappears when I do. Sept.4, 2009 I walk outside around 9pm. I see the flash. I wait a bit to make sure I saw it and again it flashes. I don���t see anything the rest of the evening. Sept. 10, 2009 Thursday morning I get up at 5am so I can take my daughter to school. At 5:30 I see the flash from my picture window. I grab my video camera and run outside. As I round the corner of the house, I see it flash again. I start the camera and immediately know this is a mistake. Everything is black and I can���t see where to aim it. It flashes once while I am rolling. Then that is it. Upon reviewing the video, I didn���t get it. That evening I set the camera up on a tripod aimed to where I think the flash comes from. I see nothing all evening Sept. 11, 2009 Again I set up the camera before dark. About 9pm I see the flash and start the camera. I see nothing the rest of the evening. Sept. 12, 2009 I see nothing. Sept. 13, 2009 I decide to give up on the camera and don���t set it up. Around 9pm I see it flash once. Sept. 14, 2009 It surprises me by flashing early. It flashes three times between 8:15 and 8:25pm. Very bright flashes. Sept. 15, 2009 Saw nothing all evening Sept. 16, 2009 Saw one flash at 6:30am Sept. 19 Saw three flashes in succession at 8pm Sept. 20 Saw one flash at 7:30pm. Since it was still somewhat light out, I was able to pinpoint its position. Sept. 23 Saw four bright flashes between 8:15 and 8:18 pm In one I saw the afterglow circling left to right (counterclockwise from above) just like the time I saw it in the sky. It flashed again at 8:20 and again at 8:37. Sept. 25 Saw one flash at 9:13pm Sept 27 Saw three flashes starting at 7:45 pm. Around 3 minutes between the 1st and 2nd , but only 10 seconds between the 2nd and 3rd. Oct. 2 May have been two flashes at 7:40am and 7:45am but might have been lightning though I never heard any thunder nor saw any more lightning (it was raining). I wasn���t looking directly at the ���spot��� when it flashed. If it was the light, it was extremely bright. Oct. 5 5 dim lights appeared along top of the hill to the north of the ���spot���. Suddenly they were there and then went out. First saw three, then another to the north and then the last to the north of that."],"Source":"MUFON","City":"Newark","Latitude":"40.06683","Object Shape":"Flash","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 16 other sightings in Newark","There were no other sightings in Newark on or around"],"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet, Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=40.06683,+-82.397604(21136)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (21136) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/25/2009 06:53 UTC","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Stationary,Straight-line path","Disposition":"Unknown","Region":"Ohio","Case Number":"21136","Log Number":"US-12252009-0022"}
