I was in the backseat of the car, my friend in the passenger seat pointed out what we thought was nothing but an airplane with beautiful colors. It was flashing green and pink lights. It seemed odd to me that it was flying so low, but then things started getting really weird. This craft completely stopped flying in an instant, and hovered motionless in the same spot for about half a minute before carrying on. Another weird thing about this craft is it started to descend towards a part of town that doesn't even have an airport! I was in complete shock and I didn't know what to think of this. My only problem is that I was so shocked, and it happened so fast, that I didn't have the chance to take any pictures or video. I just want to know if anybody else from my area seen the same thing."],"Source":"MUFON","Log Number":"US-05012012-0007","Latitude":"38.660835","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Case Number":"37864","Summary":"Stoped flying abruptly, then continued and started to decend","City":"Washington","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/37864.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/37864.html"],"Date of the Event":"04/30/2012 09:30 UTC","Disposition":"Unresolved","Object Features":"Unknown","Longitude":"-87.169779"}
