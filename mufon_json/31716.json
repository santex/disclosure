I told my 3 friends who I was with and grabbed my camera to film it. Upon zooming in on the object I noticed it was three lights in a triangular arrangement, it made no noise and was completely motionless but after filming it for a few minutes its lights dimmed and seemed to get fainter until we lost sight of it."],"Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Object Shape":"Triangle","Region":"New Mexico","Case Number":"31716","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 6 other sightings in Aztec","There were no other sightings in Aztec on or around September 8th 2011","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"Latitude":"36.857874","Disposition":"Unknown","Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=36.857874,+-108.025897(31716)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (31716) map </A>","Date of the Event":"09/08/2011 12:00 UTC","Summary":"3 dots of light in the southern sky 2 miles outside of Aztec, NM.","Log Number":"US-09102011-0027","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/31716.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/31716.html"],"Date Submitted":"09/10/2011 04:22 UTC","City":"Aztec","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Features":"Other","Country":"United States"}
