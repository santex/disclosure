{"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Disposition":"Hoax","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Tags":"City","Summary":"I saw extremely bright cigar shape hovering in sky","divs":["Sighting DetailsOn Sunday, my wife and kids were fishing at our house when my 2 yr old pointed at a passenger jet flying over head. I looked up and watched the jet cross the sky when an extremely bright object caught my eye. The sky was clear, bright blue sky around 5:00pm. This object was shiny silver, long cigar shaped and just sat there in the sky. I pointed to it to show my kids, 7yrs, 5yrs, and 2yrs. They all looked at it, my wife didn't want to admit she saw it, she thinkgs I'm crazy to want to see a ufo. But clear as day, this thing just hovered in one spot, not moving at all, and I know it couldn't have been any kind of balloon. I talked to it and said,\"come on, come down here..\", \" I see you up there\", and when I said that it seemed to get brighter, then floated off to the northwest. It never went up or down, but stayed at the same level so it couldn't have been balloons. Plus it was extremely bright for something in the sky during the day. I hope someone else saw it in my area."],"Date Submitted":"05/10/2010 11:11 UTC","Longitude":"-90.692758","Latitude":"38.817788","Country":"United States","Case Number":"23219","Log Number":"US-05102010-0003","City":"O'Fallon","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Region":"Missouri","Object Shape":"Cigar","trends":["There have been 15 other sightings in O'Fallon","There were no other sightings in O'Fallon on or around May 9th 2010"],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.817788,+-90.692758(23219)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (23219) map </A>","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/23219.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/23219.html"],"Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date of the Event":"05/09/2010 05:10 UTC"}
