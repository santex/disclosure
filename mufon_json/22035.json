There was a traffic jam on the highway way out in the suburbs approx. 20 miles from Philadelphia. My friend and I were sitting there when I mentioned to him that I had seen a TV show about UFO's the night before. He laugh and said that stuff is all bull.I mentioned that I believed in UFO's. And at that time I looked up in the sky and said you see that shiny object above us, that could be a UFOright there, he laugh. I told him to look, he refused. I looked again, thinking it was just a helicopter reporting the traffic jam. So I told to look again, he refused. I looked again while it was just sitting there. It hadn't moved. I begged him to just take a look again he refused .So I looked once more and it took off at a incredible speed and dissapered. I was in the 101st Airborne and flew in choppers all the time. I know for a fact that a helicopter does not move at such extreme speeds.At that time I had no idea what that object could have been. The object was silver and round and had no markings on it at all."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=39.959135,+-75.160079(22035)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (22035) map </A>","City":"Philadelphia","Source":"MUFON","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","Disposition":"Insufficient Data","Log Number":"US-02282010-0006","Tags":"City","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Region":"Pennsylvania","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/22035.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/22035.html"],"Summary":"A silver object in the sky above.","Date of the Event":"05/31/1997 12:00 UTC","Country":"United States","Date Submitted":"02/28/2010 01:22 UTC","Object Shape":"Circle, Disc","Latitude":"39.959135","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Flight Path":"Hovering then path","Longitude":"-75.160079"}
