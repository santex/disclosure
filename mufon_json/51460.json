They called me out. A steady, bright white light to the south was moving from west to east in a straight line. After about 2 minutes it faded, got smaller and disappeared. After about 5 minutes the same light or another similar light appeared to the southwest moving east. It, too, faded, got smaller and disappeared. I knew this wasn't a plane or satellite because it was too bright and there was no blinking. After I saw the light, I watched it steadily in case it suddenly vanished or turned or changed in any way. While outside we saw two satellits and several jets. All of these appeared smaller than the lights we saw and farther up."],"Object Shape":"Circle","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"51460","Date of the Event":"10/10/2013 08:05 UTC","Summary":"Saw steady, bright white light in the south moving west to east in straight line.
