It was reflecting the sun. It was wobbling. I focused better to make sure it wasn't a seagull and saw another sphere just as bright but smaller rotating around the larger sphere in tandem like a a gyroscope. It moved rather quickly in a southeast direction and I lost it behind trees directly in front of my balcony. When I came back with my camera phone I couldn't find it. It was a bit chilly that day, no big winds and no clouds in the area of siting. I was mesmerized for the time I followed it in the sky. I was not afraid."],"Disposition":"Unknown","Viewing Distance":"Over One Mile","City":"Santa Clarita","Weather Factors":"Unknown","trends":["There have been 33 other sightings in Santa Clarita","There was one other sighting in Santa Clarita on or around November 12th 2010"],"Object Features":"None","Date of the Event":"11/12/2010 12:00 UTC","Latitude":"34.39095","Date Submitted":"11/27/2010 02:10 UTC","Summary":"Large bright white sphere with another smaller sphere gyroscoping together"}
