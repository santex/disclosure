{"divs":["sighting detailsi am walking at the right shoulder of the national highway san fernando city la union, philippines at about 7:45 pm from my boarding house back to the office when i noticed a triangle shape with several yellow lights slowly flying\\moving in an etimated 100 ft. high with no sounds from south to north direction and suddenly stop for a couple of minutes that made me also stop walking. there were some people standing along the national highway as there are esblishments in this area like that of a gasoline station but they did not notice the said flying object that at that time was in stationary position. i supposed to call the attention of these people to look what i am seeing in the sky but the flying object slowly moves heading the direction of north west until it got lost in my sight. it came into my mind that this object is a real ufo because this is now my third time to see ufos since 1994 and it was one of a kind experienced from the 3 encounters i had."],"Summary":"A tirangle shape flying object in more than 100 feet high with several yellow lights slowly moving in north direction.","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=34.24092,+-118.527326(15382)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (15382) map </A>","Date Submitted":"12/19/2008 07:45 UTC","Object Features":"Unknown","Region":"California","Disposition":"Unresolved","City":"Los Angeles","Source":"MUFON","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/15382.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/15382.html"],"Object Shape":"Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Stationary","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Sighting Duration":"00:15:00","Latitude":"34.24092","Tags":"City","Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","Log Number":"PH-02082009-0001","Date of the Event":"12/19/2008 07:45 UTC","Country":"United States","Longitude":"-118.527326","Case Number":"15382","trends":["There have been 404 other sightings in Los Angeles","There were no other sightings in Los Angeles on or around December 19th 2008"]}
