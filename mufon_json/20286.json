Stacked at a 45 deg angle in relation to each other, they were observed by hundreds of people looking out in a easterly direction. Then the lowest one in the pattern did a sudden 90 deg dive from its trajectory, straight down at a unbelievable speed. Then the 2nd one in the pattern did a similar dive into the same area. Same for the 3rd and 4th objects in this group. I know there are no manmade objects that could fly at that speed ...and maintain the speed thru a 90 deg turn and power dive to the deck (ocean surface). Missiles don't even move that fast."],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Longitude":"-80.051285","Region":"Florida","Case Number":"20286","Object Flight Path":"Path with directional change","Latitude":"26.723842","Log Number":"US-11032009-0006","Summary":"4 objects off of West Palm Beach, Fl. 1973.","City":"West Palm Beach","Tags":"City","Weather Factors":"None","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=26.723842,+-80.051285(20286)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (20286) map </A>","Object Shape":"Unknown","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/20286.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/20286.html"],"Disposition":"Unknown"}
