I noticed a completly silent unfamiliar glowing object in the eastern night sky between my house and downtown Jacksonville . I got my 10 power binoculars and looked at it . It seemed to be a glowing saucer shaped object with some energy strings with what seemed to be bright bits of light going up and down comming out of the bottom into a ring area that constricted the \"strings\" then just below this these string of light spread out in a cone shape and got less btight the futher away from the ring area they got .This light formation underneath seemed to scan back and forth and right to left under the scaucer shape like it was looking for somwthing or maybe making a complet scan of the area . I went in the house and got my old digital camera and got three photos . The object stayed in sight for about 15-20 minutes . In my area I have seen many types of airplanes including the stealth bomber and fighter all sorts of other military and civilion aircraft including many different helicopters from the navy bases around here . I also have seen weather ballons , the blimps that come around for football games and hot air ballons . This did not match anything I have ever seen in person or on TV . Heck it didn't match anything I have seen on science fiction programs or movies . I have three raw photos some blowen up and some crude computer drawings of what the heck ever it was I saw . It looks like there is only three places to leave attachments and I have a couple more images that serve to show what I SAW BETTER IF YALL WOULD LIKE 'EM .
