They were near horizontal at 10:45 to 10:55 when I was watching. I now believe them to have been Procyon and Betelguese. I am near D.C. with a lot of background light and did not see the rest of Orion. I saw a very faint star-like light moving in between these 2 stars and flitting around, up, down, in small circles and then climbed up and then came down very fast. Saw it move in an arc downward very fast. The moon was a crescent 45 degrees downward from these 2 stars and further to left were the 3 brightest stars of Auriga in a \"triangulum\" pattern, if you will. I believe it was flittering around like the recent Mufon sighting over the Tidal Basin in D.C. and the Joshua Tree sighting a few weeks ago and the video from Valentine's Day. The moon's light caught it nicely as it arced rapidly downward toward the south, and then I did not see it again."],"Latitude":"39.004554","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","City":"Greenbelt","Country":"United States","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Features":"None","Summary":"Faint star-like light moving around 2 stars in western sky","Tags":"City","Object Flight Path":"Undisclosed","Date Submitted":"04/27/2012 11:58 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Region":"Maryland","Disposition":"Unresolved","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
