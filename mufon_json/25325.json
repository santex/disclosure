My older sister and a neighbor lady had been standing outside and watching a large cluster of flying saucers my sister said. Both of them witnessed this. My sister is living. The neighbor passed away many years ago. They had no idea who to report this to. As I recall no one ever talked about it after that day. This is a second hand report. My sister and the neighbor were of very sound mind. My MOM took an interest in UFO books from the library after that. I believe these would have been ET, because we probably would not have developed a whole fleet at that time. I doubt the Germans came from the Poles with them! This is not specific enough to archive, but thought you would like to know many people are aware they exist both ET and USA, maybe Russia has them too by now. The Bible calls Lucifer the Prince of the Powers of the Air. This is not just spiritual, they left the upper bands and enter our universe."],"Weather Factors":"Unknown","Latitude":"33.996126","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Source":"MUFON","Region":"California","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Object Shape":"Disc","Log Number":"US-09072010-0005","Longitude":"-117.405602","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"09/07/2010 01:21 UTC","Date of the Event":"07/10/1959 12:00 UTC","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Rubidoux","There were no other sightings in Rubidoux on or around July 10th 1959"]}
