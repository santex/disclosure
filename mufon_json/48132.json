I turned and watched it go from Northwest to Southwest over southwest suburbs outside of Chicago. I thought for sure it was plane at first, it seemed to change shape, lights flickered as if it were helicopter or plane but it seemed way too low to be flying over my neighborhood. I got a real good look at it when it was about 3 blocks from me. It had short stubs on the side of object and glided through the air very easy. I thought it was a missile, then someone flying a remote controlled plane but as it got closer I seen it have no wings and looked like a missile and submarine into one. I am sure something can be explained but couldnt seat more than 4 people from what I saw."],"map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.694376,+-87.763591(48132)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (48132) map </A>","Viewing Distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","Date Submitted":"06/14/2013 06:48 UTC","Date of the Event":"06/14/2013 03:44 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Sighting Duration":"00:01:02","Log Number":"US-06142013-0017","Country":"United States"}
