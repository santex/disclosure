My immediate thought was the lights resembled the constellation, Cassiopeia. Then I realized they were far too close, too bright, as well as the color orange. By the time I pulled my car over, I noticed the lights kept moving around swiftly, creating different shapes in the sky. I grabbed the cameras thinking, \"This is a major UFO siting.\" The lights appeared to be hoovering then making sudden movements creating different formations. Four out of five of the lights slowly disappeared into space while one lingered in the sky. A sixth object slowly came n from the southern sky and met up with the fifth. Both object then disappeared together. There where no aircraft visible in the air at the time and no sound created from the lights."],"Disposition":"Unresolved","Weather Factors":"Unknown","Date Submitted":"07/29/2012 02:56 UTC","Log Number":"US-07292012-0007","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33.202767,+-117.241396(41242)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (41242) map </A>","Longitude":"-117.241396","Summary":"6 bright orange lights hoovering and changing formation","Tags":"City","City":"Vista","trends":["There have been 11 other sightings in Vista","There were no other sightings in Vista on or around July 28th 2012","This sighting has never been favorited.",""],"files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/41242.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41242_submitter_file1__1005038.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41242_submitter_file2__1005039.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41242_submitter_file3__1005041.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/more/41242_submitter_file4__1005046.JPG","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/41242.html"],"Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Viewing Distance":"Unknown"}
