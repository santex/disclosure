SO I WALKED TO THE BATHROOM AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND SAW A LARGE WHITE LIGHT IN THE SKY ON THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF OUR HOUSE AND THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE. THERE WAS NO SOUND, FLYING SLOWLY . I THEN CALLED MY WIFE TO COME SEE THE OBJECT . WE WATCHED IT FLY NORTHEAST . THEN IT MADE A SHARP TURN TO THE NORTH AND DID NOT CHANGE INTENSITY . IT WAS A PERFECT CIRCLE OF LIGHT NO MATTER THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL . IT THEN TURNED BACK TO THE NORTHEAST AFTER FLYING ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE , IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE HOUSE . THE SKIES WERE CLEAR AND NO MOON , WE THINK THAT IT WAS 1500-2000 FEET ELEVATION . THIS FRIGHTENED US SO MUCH THAT WE JUST WENT TO BED AND NEVER TOLD THE EVENT TO ANYONE AND DID'NT WANT TO BE RIDICULED BY NON BELIEVERS .BUT THE WIFE AND I THOUGHT THAT WE NEEDED TO TELL SOMEONE . THIS HAPPENED IN THE SPRING OF THIS YEAR '08 . DONT REMEMBER THE EXACT DAY AS WE KEPT IT TO OURSELVES SO LONG . THE FUNNY PART IS WE HAVE A VIDEO CAMERA AND A DIGITAL CAMERA SITTING IN THE CLOSET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BEDROOM, JUST CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT I GUESS ?.
