It was very dark, and I just happen to look up in the east sky and I saw a very bright light. At first, I thought it was just a star,but then it moved very slowly forward and from side to side, but not far in distance. I called my wife out to see what she thought and she could see what I was seeing. I went back in and got my bicolucors and look at the object. It was still moving very slowily in a small area and I could not see any shape to it. It had a very bright light with very small lights around it. I came to the conclusion, that it was just a hot air baloon. It was not an airplane, as I know about the blinking safety lights on an airplane. I started to call the police station to she if anyone ele was watching, but, thought better of it, as that would just say some crazy old man is seeing things. My daughter came out on the porch and could see what we were seeing. so. we just forgot about it, untill alot of people in our area saw something also. I have a very goog camera, but took no thought to trying to take a photo of what we were seeing, because we thought it was just an hot air baloon.
