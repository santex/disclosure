The sky was clear. This object was just so bright and it looked too low in the sky to be a satellite. I have seen many satellites and this just did not behave like one. I live about 2 to 3 miles from the airport. Airplanes were clearly visible circling in the sky, and appeared to be much higher than this object. It was very quiet and lasted for approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute. The bright white light then shut off, and then there was a tiny red light, for about 2 seconds and then that shut off. It almost appeared as though this object just vanished. I lost sight of this object because the lights turned off and it was gone."],"Log Number":"US-10282010-0015","City":"Windsor","Country":"United States","Viewing Distance":"Unknown","trends":["There has been one other sighting in Windsor","There were no other sightings in Windsor on or around October 28th 2010"],"Date of the Event":"10/28/2010 07:15 UTC","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/26166.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/26166.html"],"Latitude":"41.8535","Disposition":"IFO","Tags":"City","Date Submitted":"10/28/2010 08:17 UTC","Object Features":"None","Case Number":"26166","Sighting Duration":"00:00:45","Source":"MUFON","Weather Factors":"None","Object Shape":"Star-like","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path,Unknown"}
