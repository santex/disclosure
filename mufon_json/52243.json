When I filmed it however it is projecting a diamond shaped light beam which made me originally think it was diamond shaped.","Date of the Event":"11/13/2013 12:00 UTC","divs":["Sighting DetailsI have been visit two nights in a row by startlike lights that project a strobe that looks like a cross between a diamond and a stopsign. I can see it through my video camera with the zoom all the way on but this strobe cannot be seen with the naked eye. These start like lights do move but subtely and are mostly hovering. I marked them again things on the ground and this is how I know they are moving. Also in my video there are clicking sounds that shoul;d not be there. Another person has reported to me they are hearing high pitched soinds coming from the videos. It's very cold here now so it is not animal sounds. I will repoert more if the situation escalates. Thank you."],"Case Number":"52243","trends":["There have been 5 other sightings in Wausau","There were no other sightings in Wausau on or around November 13th 2013"]}
