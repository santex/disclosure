{"Viewing Distance":"101-500 Feet","divs":["sighting detailsme and a friend where just out playing at the top of the street when the friend say's to me look at that looking upwards so i look and it was almost as if your eyes had to change focus it's hard to explain but you could of had this object fly past you a million times and not notice it but there in the sky was a silver\\metalic sphere moving from my left to right as i looked up on either side but not attached to it was black traingles also one in front i would say they where sperate craft almost a escort these could have been stealth bombers i suppose? but i don't think they where. it was a bright clear day and i see no way how such a object could fly being it had no wings and there was no noise at all also nothing coming out of it just a pure ball. we just stood watching as they continued to go across the sky until they where out of site, to this day i believe it was something not made on this planet and i don't think anyone could convince me otherwise. i don't know what my friend saw before that but he said the object's that we both saw weren't what he was orginally trying to point out. to be honest we didn't really talk about what we saw to each other and haven't spoken for quite a few years now. i really wish i had a camera at the time but when your a kid out playing who does right? the thought did cross my mind to run to the house about 1min away and ask for one but it would have been to late anyway. this story is 100% true although the date\\time are probably wrong it was quite a few years ago but not something you forget."],"trends":["There have been no other sightings in Caerphilly","This sighting has never been favorited."],"Summary":"Silver sphere & with triangle escort?","Sighting Duration":"Undisclosed","Date of the Event":"11/30/1998 12:00 UTC","Source":"MUFON","Object Features":"Undisclosed","Log Number":"GB-04282009-0014","Disposition":"Unresolved","Latitude":"51.578829","Longitude":"-3.218134","Case Number":"16718","Tags":"City","City":"Caerphilly","Region":"Wales","map":"<A HREF = \"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.578829,+-3.218134(16718)&iwloc=A&hl=en\"> mufon case (16718) map </A>","Date Submitted":"11/30/1998 12:00 UTC","Weather Factors":"None","Country":"United Kingdom","Object Shape":"Sphere, Triangle","Object Flight Path":"Straight-line path","files":["/var/www/straped/mufon/html2text/16718.html.txt","/var/www/straped/mufon/org/16718.html"]}
